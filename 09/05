However, it can be difficult to distinguish normal\nfrom pathological HFOs, and the visual detection of HFOs is very\ntime-intensive. An automated algorithm for detecting HFOs and for wide-band\nspectral analysis is desirable.\n  Methods: The damped-oscillator oscillator detector (DOOD) is adapted for HFO\ndetection, and tested on recordings from one rat and one human. The rat data\nconsist of recordings from the hippocampus just prior to induction of status\nepilepticus, and again 6 weeks after induction, after the rat is epileptic.

Based on a lookahead\nwindow prediction model, we first establish a novel equivalence between the\npredictive queueing system with a \\emph{fully-efficient} scheduling scheme and\nan equivalent queueing system without prediction. This connection allows us to\nanalytically demonstrate that predictive scheduling necessarily improves system\ndelay performance and can drive it to zero with increasing prediction power. We\nthen propose the \\textsf{Predictive Backpressure (PBP)} algorithm for achieving\noptimal utility performance in such predictive systems. \\textsf{PBP}\nefficiently incorporates prediction into stochastic system control and avoids\nthe great complication due to the exponential state space growth in the\nprediction window size. We show that \\textsf{PBP} can achieve a utility\nperformance that is within $O(\\epsilon)$ of the optimal, for any $\\epsilon>0$,\nwhile guaranteeing that the system delay distribution is a\n\\emph{shifted-to-the-left} version of that under the original Backpressure\nalgorithm. Hence, the average packet delay under \\textsf{PBP} is strictly\nbetter than that under Backpressure, and vanishes with increasing prediction\nwindow size.

One traditionally\nwaits for the junk radiation to exit the computational domain before taking\nphysical readings, at the expense of throwing away a segment of the evolution,\nand with the hope that junk radiation exits cleanly. We argue that this hope\ndoes not necessarily pan out as junk radiation could excite long-lived\nconstraint violation. Another complication with the initial data is that it\ncontains orbital eccentricity that needs to be removed, usually by evolving the\nearly part of the inspiral multiple times with gradually improved input\nparameters. We show that this procedure is also adversely impacted by junk\nradiation. In this paper, we do not attempt to eliminate junk radiation\ndirectly, but instead tackle the much simpler problem of ameliorating its\nlong-lasting effects. We report on the success of a method that achieves this\ngoal by combining the removal of junk radiation and eccentricity into a single\n\"joint-elimination\" procedure. This approach has the following benefits: (1) We\ndo not have to contend with the influence of junk radiation on eccentricity\nmeasurements for later iterations of the eccentricity reduction procedure. (2)\nWe re-enforce constraints periodically by invoking the initial data solver,\nremoving the constraint violation excited by junk radiation previously. (3) The\nwasted simulation segment associated with the junk radiation's evolution is\nabsorbed into the eccentricity reduction iterations. Furthermore, (1) and (2)\ntogether allow us to carry out our joint-elimination procedure at low\nresolution, even when the subsequent \"production run\" is intended as a high\nresolution simulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Sep 2013 19:16:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-24"}

The observed energy density of this\nbackground will therefore appear anisotropic at different angles in the sky. We\nprovide a master formula for the angular power spectrum C_l of the anisotropies\nin the GW background from preheating, valid for any scenario where the\nanisotropies are due to the superhorizon modulation of a light degree of\nfreedom.

Improved and new PM\nmeasurements will further test these predictions. A strong alignment of the\nsatellite galaxy orbital poles is not expected in dark matter based simulations\nof galaxy formation. Coherent orbital directions of satellite galaxies are,\nhowever, a natural consequence of tidal dwarf galaxies formed together in the\ndebris of a galaxy collision. The orbital poles of the MW satellite galaxies\ntherefore lend further support to tidal scenarios for the origin of the VPOS\nand are a very significant challenge for the standard LCDM model of cosmology.\nWe also note that the dependence of the MW satellite speeds on Galactocentric\ndistance appear to map an effective potential with a constant velocity of\napproximately 240 km/s to about 250 kpc. The individual satellite velocities\nare only mildly radial.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Sep 2013 20:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

RDA is in error by less than 1% for many\nconfigurations of core sizes and layer densities congruent with those of solid\nbodies in the Solar System. We determine the error in the MOI of icy satellites\ncalculated with the RDA due to nonhydrostatic effects by using a simple model\nin which the core and outer shell have slight degree 2 distortions away from\ntheir expected hydrostatic shapes. Since the hydrostatic shape has an\nassociated stress of order pw^2R^2 (where p is density) it follows that the\nimportance of nonhydrostatic effects scales with the dimensionless number\ns/pw^2R^2, where s is the nonhydrostatic stress. This highlights the likely\nimportance of this error for slowly rotating bodies (e.g., Titan and Callisto)\nand small bodies (e.g., Saturn moons other than Titan). We apply this model to\nTitan, Callisto, and Enceladus and find that the RDA-derived MOI can be 10%\ngreater than the actual MOI for nonhydrostatic stresses as small as ~0.1 bars\nat the surface or ~1 bar at the core-mantle boundary, while for Ganymede the\nstresses necessary to produce the same MOI errors are an order of magnitude\ngreater due to its faster rotation. If satellites can reorient to the lowest\nenergy state then RDA will always give an overestimate of the true MOI.\nObservations have shown that small nonhydrostatic gravity anomalies exist on\nGanymede and Titan. We conclude that nonhydrostatic effects could be present to\nan extent that allows Callisto and Titan to be fully differentiated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Sep 2013 23:04:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

We perform an analytical\nstudy of the model in the late-time dark energy dominated epoch, where we\nobtain a solution for $r_cH(z)$, where $r_c$ is the leakage scale of gravity\ninto the bulk, and conditions for the negative branch on the holographic\nparameters $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$, in order to hold the conditions of weak energy\nand accelerated universe. On the other hand, we compare the model versus the\nlate-time cosmological data using the latest type Ia supernova sample of the\nJoint Light-curve Analysis (JLA), in order to constraint the holographic\nparameters in the negative branch, as well as $r_cH_0$ in the positive branch,\nwhere $H_0$ is the Hubble constant. We find that the model has a good fit to\nthe data and that the most likely values for $(r_cH_0, \\alpha, \\beta)$ lie in\nthe permitted region found from an analytical solution in a dark energy\ndominated universe. We give a justification to use holographic cut-off in 4D\nfor the dark energy in the 5 dimensional DGP model. Finally, using the Bayesian\nInformation Criterion we find that this model it is disfavored compared with\nthe flat $\\Lambda$CDM model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Sep 2013 00:10:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Nov 2014 18:33:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

The signal of the negative superhump was always the\ndominant one even during the superoutburst, in contrast to our common knowledge\nabout superhumps in dwarf novae. The signal of the positive superhump was only\ntransiently seen during the superoutburst, and it quickly decayed after the\nsuperoutburst. The frequency variation of the negative superhump was similar to\nthe two previously studied dwarf novae in the Kepler field, V1504 Cyg and V344\nLyr.

The\nproblem needs to be approached first with a diagonalized form (the spectral\nrepresentation) to deal with degeneracy. Such a form is useful for this\nparametrization in that the conditions to be a density matrix from a Hermitian\nmatrix are applied only to a diagonal eigenvalue matrix, not a unitary matrix.\nThose conditions can be satisfied by parametrizing eigenvalues with squared\nspherical coordinates in dimension of the matrix. Degeneracy in eigenvalues\nbrings symmetries between a eigenvalue matrix and a unitary matrix, which are\nrealized in a form of a commuting unitary matrix, called a commutant. The\nassociated redundant parameters in a unitary matrix have to be eliminated. It\nis realized in this paper that degrees of degeneracies can be defined as the\ntotal number of possible pairs of the same eigenvalues and one degree of\ndegeneracy corresponds to one phase and one two dimensional rotation in a\nunitary matrix or a commutant. In this way all the degeneracies are identified\nand assigned to one phase-one rotation block. Therefore, a unitary matrix or a\ncommutant is a product of these blocks and a general diagonal phase matrix. In\nphysics a unitary matrix is often parametrized by rotation and phase matrices,\ncalled an angular representation here. There are many possible different phase\nconfigurations. It is often not a trivial matter whether a given parametrized\nunitary matrix is general. A simple diagram will be introduced to illustrate\nhow to transform one phase configuration to another.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Sep 2013 06:13:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-06"}

We find that\nthere is a good match between projected capabilities of the future space\nmissions PLATO and CHEOPS and the new observable. We give some initial science\nquestion that such a new observable may be related to and help addressing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Sep 2013 07:30:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

We ask\nwhether there exists a bounded representation in which each interval I_v has\nits left endpoint in L_v and its right endpoint in R_v. We show that the\nproblem can be solved in linear time for interval graphs and in quadratic time\nfor proper interval graphs.\n  Robert's Theorem states that the classes of proper interval graphs and unit\ninterval graphs are equal.

The brown-dwarf was identified\nfrom the Canada France Brown Dwarf Survey. At a distance of 50-120 pc, the 7.7\narcsec angular separation corresponds to projected separations of 390-900 AU.\nThe primary displays no Halpha emission, placing a lower limit on the age of\nthe system of about 6 Gyr. The kinematics is also consistent with membership in\nthe old thin disc. We obtained near-infrared spectra, which together with\nrecent atmosphere models allow us determine the effective temperature and\ngravity of both components. From these parameters and the age constraint,\nevolutionary models estimate masses of 0.10 to 0.15 Msol for the M dwarf, and\n0.06 to 0.07 Msol for the T dwarf. This system is a particularly valuable\nbenchmark because the brown dwarf is an early T: the cloud-clearing that occurs\nat the L/T transition is very sensitive to gravity, metallicity, and detailed\ndust properties, and produces a large scatter in the colours. This T2 dwarf,\nwith its metallicity measured from the primary and its mass and gravity much\nbetter constrained than those of younger early-Ts, will anchor our\nunderstanding of the colours of L/T transition brown dwarfs. It is also one of\nthe most massive T dwarfs, just below the hydrogen-burning limit, and all this\nmakes it a prime probe a brown dwarf atmosphere and evolution models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Sep 2013 07:41:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

The exceptional optical sampling achieved by\nthe GLAST-AGILE Support Program (GASP) of the Whole Earth Blazar Telescope\n(WEBT) in collaboration with the Steward Observatory allows us to perform a\ndetailed comparison with the daily gamma-ray observations by Fermi. Discrete\ncorrelation analysis between the optical and gamma-ray emission reveals\ncorrelation with a time lag of 0 +- 1 d, which suggests cospatiality of the\ncorresponding jet emitting regions. A better definition of the time lag is\nhindered by the daily gaps in the sampling of the extremely fast flux\nvariations. In general, optical flares present more structure and develop on\nlonger time scales than corresponding gamma-ray flares. Observations at X-rays\nand at millimetre wavelengths reveal a common trend, which suggests that the\nregion producing the mm and X-ray radiation is located downstream from the\noptical and gamma-ray-emitting zone in the jet. The mean optical degree of\npolarisation slightly decreases over the considered period and in general it is\nhigher when the flux is lower.

The new method is based on a\ncomparison of the estimated spectral distribution on different segments of the\nobserved time series and consists of three steps: it starts with a consistent\ntest, which allows to prove the existence of structural breaks at a controlled\ntype I error. Secondly, it estimates sets containing possible break points and\nfinally these sets are reduced to identify the relevant structural breaks and\ncorresponding components which are responsible for the changes in the\nautocovariance structure. In contrast to all other methods which have been\nproposed in the literature, our approach does not make any parametric\nassumptions, is not especially designed for detecting one single change point\nand addresses the problem of multiple structural breaks in the autocovariance\nfunction directly with no use of the binary segmentation algorithm. We prove\nthat the new procedure detects all components and the corresponding locations\nwhere structural breaks occur with probability converging to one as the sample\nsize increases and provide data-driven rules for the selection of all\nregularization parameters. The results are illustrated by analyzing financial\nreturns, and in a simulation study it is demonstrated that the new procedure\noutperforms the currently available nonparametric methods for detecting breaks\nin the dependency structure of multivariate time series.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Sep 2013 11:00:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-06"}

These\nfeatures appear to be related to coronal fans, which have previously been\nobserved in white-light coronagraph images and, at low heights, in the EUV. We\nalso discuss the evolution of the corona at different heights above the solar\nsurface and the evolution of the corona over the course of the solar cycle by\nhemisphere.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Sep 2013 13:37:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

Here, we study\ngeneric capsid ejection using Langevin dynamics. We show that even when the\nejection takes place within the drift-dominated region there is a very high\nprobability for the ejection process not to be completed. Introducing a small\naligning force at the pore entrance enhances ejection dramatically. Such a pore\nasymmetry is a candidate for a mechanism by which a viral ejection is\ncompleted. By detailed high-resolution simulations we show that such capsid\nejection is an out-of-equilibrium process that shares many common features with\nthe much studied driven polymer translocation through a pore in a wall or a\nmembrane. We find that the escape times scale with polymer length, $\\tau \\sim\nN^\\alpha$. We show that for the pore without the asymmetry the previous\npredictions corroborated by Monte Carlo simulations do not hold. For the pore\nwith the asymmetry the scaling exponent varies with the initial monomer density\n(monomers per capsid volume) $\\rho$ inside the capsid. For very low densities\n$\\rho \\le 0.002$ the polymer is only weakly confined by the capsid, and we\nmeasure $\\alpha = 1.33$, which is close to $\\alpha = 1.4$ obtained for polymer\ntranslocation. At intermediate densities the scaling exponents $\\alpha = 1.25$\nand $1.21$ for $\\rho = 0.01$ and $0.02$, respectively. These scalings are in\naccord with a crude derivation for the lower limit $\\alpha = 1.2$. For the\nasymmetrical pore precise scaling breaks down, when the density exceeds the\nvalue for complete confinement by the capsid, $\\rho \\gtrapprox 0.25$. The\nhigh-resolution data show that the capsid ejection for both pores, analogously\nto polymer translocation, can be characterized as a multiplicative stochastic\nprocess that is dominated by small-scale transitions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Sep 2013 14:21:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 5 Mar 2014 08:24:28 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 8 May 2014 13:03:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-09"}

The aim of this paper is a\nstatistical study of the basic properties of AME regions and the environment in\nwhich they emit. We used WMAP and Planck maps, combined with ancillary radio\nand IR data, to construct a sample of 98 candidate AME sources, assembling SEDs\nfor each source using aperture photometry on 1deg-smoothed maps from 0.408 GHz\nup to 3000 GHz. Each spectrum is fitted with a simple model of free-free,\nsynchrotron (where necessary), cosmic microwave background (CMB), thermal dust,\nand spinning dust components. We find that 42 of the 98 sources have\nsignificant (>5sigma) excess emission at frequencies between 20 and 60 GHz. An\nanalysis of the potential contribution of optically thick free-free emission\nfrom ultra-compact HII regions, using IR colour criteria, reduces the\nsignificant AME sample to 27 regions. The spectrum of the AME is consistent\nwith model spectra of spinning dust. The AME regions tend to be more spatially\nextended than regions with little or no AME. The AME intensity is strongly\ncorrelated with the submillimetre/IR flux densities and comparable to previous\nAME detections in the literature. AME emissivity, defined as the ratio of AME\nto dust optical depth, varies by an order of magnitude for the AME regions. The\nAME regions tend to be associated with cooler dust in the range 14-20 K and an\naverage emissivity index of +1.8, while the non-AME regions are typically\nwarmer, at 20-27 K. In agreement with previous studies, the AME emissivity\nappears to decrease with increasing column density. The emerging picture is\nthat the bulk of the AME is coming from the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons\nand small dust grains from the colder neutral interstellar medium phase\n(Abridged).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Sep 2013 14:28:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 17 May 2014 17:45:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-21"}

Polling systems in which arrivals of users occur anywhere in a\ncontinuum are called continuous polling systems. Often one encounters a\ncombination of the two systems: the users can either arrive in a continuum or\nwait in a finite set (i.e. wait at a finite number of queues). We call these\nsystems mixed polling systems. Also, in some applications, customers are\nrerouted to a new location (for another service) after their service is\ncompleted. In this work, we study mixed polling systems with rerouting. We\nobtain their steady state performance by discretization using the known pseudo\nconservation laws of discrete polling systems. Their stationary expected\nworkload is obtained as a limit of the stationary expected workload of a\ndiscrete system. The main tools for our analysis are: a) the fixed point\nanalysis of infinite dimensional operators and; b) the convergence of Riemann\nsums to an integral.\n  We analyze two applications using our results on mixed polling systems and\ndiscuss the optimal system design.

They were observed with PACS and SPIRE onboard\nHerschel at 70,100,160,250,350, and 500 microns. We focus on a systematic\ncomparison of the derived FIR properties (FIR luminosity, dust mass, dust\ntemperature and emissivity index) with more metal-rich galaxies and investigate\nthe detection of a potential submm excess. The data reduction method is adapted\nfor each galaxy to derive the most reliable photometry from the final maps.\nPACS flux densities are compared with the MIPS 70 and 160 microns bands. We use\ncolour-colour diagrams and modified blackbody fitting procedures to determine\nthe dust properties of the DGS galaxies. We also include galaxies from the\nHerschel KINGFISH sample, containing more metal-rich environments, totalling\n109 galaxies. The location of the DGS galaxies on Herschel colour-colour\ndiagrams highlights the differences in global environments of low-metallicity\ngalaxies. The dust in DGS galaxies is generally warmer than in KINGFISH\ngalaxies (T_DGS~32 K, T_KINGFISH~23 K). The emissivity index, beta, is ~1.7 in\nthe DGS, but metallicity does not make a strong effect on beta. The\ndust-to-stellar mass ratio is lower in low-metallicity galaxies:\nM_dust/M_star~0.02% for the DGS vs 0.1% for KINGFISH. Per unit dust mass, dwarf\ngalaxies emit ~6 times more in the FIR than higher metallicity galaxies. Out of\nthe 22 DGS galaxies detected at 500 micron, 41% present an excess in the submm\nnot explained by our dust SED model. The excess mainly appears in lower\nmetallicity galaxies (12+log(O/H) < 8.3), and the strongest excesses are\ndetected in the most metal-poor galaxies.

Evidence comes\nfrom the accessibility to external methanethiosulfonate (MTS) reagents of the\npositively charged arginine residues (R) on this segment. These are first\nmutated to cysteines (C), which in turn react with MTS reagents; it is assumed\nthat the C is passively carried in the S4 movement, becoming accessible on one\nside or the other of the membrane. However, the Rs were salt bridged to\nnegatively charged residues on other transmembrane segments, or hydrogen\nbonded, while C reacts as a negative ion. The space available for MTS is fairly\nclose to the difference in volume between the large R residue and much smaller\nC, so the MTS is not severely sterically hindered. A reagent molecule can reach\na C side chain; the C can react if not repelled by a negative charge from the\namino acid to which the R had been salt bridged. Nearby protons may also make\nreaction possible unless the C itself is protonated. Therefore interpretation\nof the C substitution results requires reconsideration. To test the idea we\nhave done quantum calculations on part of a mutated S4 and the nearby section\nof the channel. The mutation is R300C of the 2A79/3Lut structure, a mutation\nthat would be done to test MTS reagent access; there is a large cavity where\nthe R is replaced by C. Two quantum calculations show a substantial difference\nin the structure of this cavity with 2 water molecules compared to 4. This\nsuggests that the structure, and presumably reaction probability, could depend\non water molecules, very likely also protons, in or near the cavity that the\nR300C mutation produces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Sep 2013 15:24:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-06"}

These often manifest as\nviolations of Bell's inequalities, bounds derived from the assumptions of\nlocality and realism, concepts integral to classical physics. Many tests of\nBell's inequalities have studied pairs of correlated particles; however, the\nimmense interest in multi-particle quantum correlations is driving the\nexperimental frontier to test systems beyond just pairs. All experimental\nviolations of Bell's inequalities to date require supplementary assumptions,\nopening the results to one or more loopholes, the closing of which is one of\nthe most important challenges in quantum science. Individual loopholes have\nbeen closed in experiments with pairs of particles and a very recent result\nclosed the detection loophole in a six ion experiment. No experiment thus far\nhas closed the locality loopholes with three or more particles. Here, we\ndistribute three-photon Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger entangled states using\noptical fibre and free-space links to independent measurement stations. The\nmeasured correlations constitute a test of Mermin's inequality while closing\nboth the locality and related freedom-of-choice loopholes due to our\nexperimental configuration and timing. We measured a Mermin parameter of 2.77\n+/- 0.08, violating the inequality bound of 2 by over 9 standard deviations,\nwith minimum tolerances for the locality and freedom-of-choice loopholes of 264\n+/- 28 ns and 304 +/- 25 ns, respectively. These results represent a\nsignificant advance towards definitive tests of the foundations of quantum\nmechanics and practical multi-party quantum communications protocols.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Sep 2013 15:57:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-30"}

The relaxed linear micromorphic continuum: existence,\nuniqueness and continuous dependence in dynamics, submitted, 2013,\narXiv:1308.3762] has been used to study wave propagation in unbounded continua\nwith microstructure. By studying dispersion relations for the considered\nrelaxed medium, we are able to disclose precise frequency ranges (band-gaps)\nfor which propagation of waves cannot occur. These dispersion relations are\nstrongly nonlinear so giving rise to a macroscopic dispersive behavior of the\nconsidered medium. We prove that the presence of band-gaps is related to a\nunique elastic coefficient, the so-called Cosserat couple modulus $\\mu_{c}$,\nwhich is also responsible for the loss of symmetry of the Cauchy force stress\ntensor.
