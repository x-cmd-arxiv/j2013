Specifically, we consider a single wireless\ntransceiver/user with access to $N$ channels, each modeled as an iid\ndiscrete-time two-state Markov chain. In each time step the user is allowed to\nsense $k\\leq N$ channels, and subsequently use up to $m\\leq k$ channels out of\nthose sensed to be available. Channel sensing is assumed to be perfect, and for\neach channel use in each time step the user gets a unit reward. The user's\nobjective is to maximize its total discounted or average reward over a finite\nor infinite horizon. This problem has previously been studied in various\nspecial cases including $k=1$ and $m=k\\leq N$, often cast as a restless bandit\nproblem, with optimality results derived for a myopic policy that seeks to\nmaximize the immediate one-step reward when the two-state Markov chain model is\npositively correlated. In this paper we study the general problem with $1\\leq\nm\\leq k\\leq N$, and derive sufficient conditions under which the myopic policy\nis optimal for the finite and infinite horizon reward criteria, respectively.\nIt is shown that these results reduce to those derived in prior studies under\nthe corresponding special cases, and thus may be viewed as a set of unifying\noptimality conditions. Numerical examples are also presented to highlight how\nand why an optimal policy may deviate from the otherwise-optimal myopic sensing\ngiven additional exploration opportunities, i.e., when $m<k$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Sep 2013 19:01:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-17"}

A\nnetwork flow is stable if there is no group of vertices that all could benefit\nfrom rerouting the flow along a walk.\n  Fleiner established that a stable flow always exists by reducing it to the\nstable allocation problem. We present an augmenting-path algorithm for\ncomputing a stable flow, the first algorithm that achieves polynomial running\ntime for this problem without using stable allocation as a black-box\nsubroutine. We further consider the problem of finding a stable flow such that\nthe flow value on every edge is within a given interval. For this problem, we\npresent an elegant graph transformation and based on this, we devise a simple\nand fast algorithm, which also can be used to find a solution to the stable\nmarriage problem with forced and forbidden edges.\n  Finally, we study the stable multicommodity flow model introduced by\nKir\\'{a}ly and Pap. The original model is highly involved and allows for\ncommodity-dependent preference lists at the vertices and commodity-specific\nedge capacities. We present several graph-based reductions that show\nequivalence to a significantly simpler model. We further show that it is\nNP-complete to decide whether an integral solution exists.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Sep 2013 21:17:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 Apr 2017 20:45:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 24 Dec 2018 09:29:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-27"}

One of the superoutbursts in V1504 Cyg was preceded by a precursor normal\noutburst which was well separated from the main superoutburst. The superhump\nfirst appeared during the descending branch of the precursor normal outburst\nand it continued into quiescence (the deep dip between the precursor and the\nmain superoutburst), and it began to grow in amplitude with the growth of the\nmain superoutburst after quiescence ended.

The `common input' problem presents the major\nroadblock: it is difficult to reliably distinguish causal connections between\npairs of observed neurons from correlations induced by common input from\nunobserved neurons. Since available recording techniques allow us to sample\nfrom only a small fraction of large networks simultaneously with sufficient\ntemporal resolution, naive connectivity estimators that neglect these common\ninput effects are highly biased. This work proposes a `shotgun' experimental\ndesign, in which we observe multiple sub-networks briefly, in a serial manner.\nThus, while the full network cannot be observed simultaneously at any given\ntime, we may be able to observe most of it during the entire experiment. Using\na generalized linear model for a spiking recurrent neural network, we develop\nscalable approximate Bayesian methods to perform network inference given this\ntype of data, in which only a small fraction of the network is observed in each\ntime bin. We demonstrate in simulation that, using this method: (1) The shotgun\nexperimental design can eliminate the biases induced by common input effects.\n(2) Networks with thousands of neurons, in which only a small fraction of the\nneurons is observed in each time bin, could be quickly and accurately\nestimated.

The latter is known to provide topological invariants which are\ngeneralizations of the Witten index. In addition, we relate the $Z_3$-graded\nalgebra to the generators of the SO(2,1) Lie algebra underlying each shape\ninvariant system. We generalize the results to the case of sequential shape\ninvariant systems, in which case we find a sequence of $Z_3$-graded algebras.\nFinally, we briefly discuss two systems that are related to shape invariance,\nbut have different algebraic origin, namely supersymmetric systems with central\ncharge equipped with an additional symmetry and $Z_3$-graded algebraic systems.\nIn view of the fact that the shape invariance condition is somewhat an\nadditional algebraic condition, with no origin to some concrete algebraic\nstructure, our results might be useful towards this line of research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Sep 2013 09:01:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 3 May 2014 10:42:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 4 Jun 2014 13:30:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

The insulating phase occurs due to\ntrapping of the charge carriers by polaronic lattice distortions, which raise\nthe resistivity. Theories based on local physics predict that the magnitude of\nthe resistivity jump at Tc is determined by how much, on average, the amplitude\nof these distortions increases at the phase transition. Using neutron\nscattering, we measured the average distortion amplitude in La0.7Sr0.3MnO3.\nSurprisingly, its increase from below to above Tc is just as large as in other\nmanganites, which have a much larger resistivity jump. This result suggests\nthat the strength of CMR is determined not by the size of distortions, but by\ntheir cooperative nature specific to each compound.

For this, various theoretical definitions of\nTK are analyzed based on the inverse magnetic impurity susceptibility at zero\ntemperature. While conventional definitions in that respect quickly fail to\nensure universal Kondo scaling for all D, this paper proposes an altered\ndefinition of TK_{sc} that allows universal scaling of dynamical or thermal\nquantities for a given fixed Hamiltonian. If the scaling is performed with\nrespect to an external parameter which directly enters the Hamiltonian, such as\nmagnetic field, the corresponding TK_{sc;B} for universal scaling differs, yet\nbecomes equivalent to TK_{sc} in the scaling limit. The only requirement for\nuniversal scaling in the full Kondo parameter regime with a residual error of\nless than 1% is a well-defined isolated Kondo feature with TK < 0.01D. By\nvarying D over a wide range relative to the bare energies of the impurity, for\nexample, this allows a smooth transition from the Anderson to the Kondo model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Sep 2013 13:18:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Oct 2013 22:48:04 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 25 Feb 2014 13:07:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-26"}

In this\npaper it is shown how a spatially-selective and internal-state-selective\ntriggering pulse is constructed generally in the quantum system of a single\natom. Rigorous theoretical calculation and error estimation, which are based on\nthe Trotter-Suzuki decomposition method and the multiple-Gaussian-wave-packet\nexpansion method, are carried out for the time evolution process of a single\natom in the double-well potential field and in the presence of the\nspatially-selective and internal-state-selective triggering pulse.

For a module $L\\subseteq \\mathrm{Der}(-\\log X)$ let\n$I_k(L)$ be the ideal generated by the $k\\times k$ minors of a matrix of\ngenerators for $L$; these are the Fitting ideals of\n$\\mathrm{Der}_{\\mathbb{C}^n,p}/L$. We aim to: (i) find sufficient conditions on\n$\\{I_k(L)\\}$ to prove $L=\\mathrm{Der}(-\\log X)$; (ii) identify\n$\\{I_k(\\mathrm{Der}(-\\log X))\\}$, to provide a necessary condition for\nequality; and (iii) provide a geometric interpretation of these ideals.\n  Even for $(X,p)$ smooth, an example shows that Fitting ideals alone are\ninsufficient to prove equality, although we give a different criterion. Using\n(ii) and (iii) in the smooth case, we give partial answers to (ii) and (iii)\nfor arbitrary $(X,p)$.

One such phenomenon is heterosis or hybrid vigor:\ncrossing individuals from genetically distinct populations often results in\nimprovements in quantitative traits, such as growth rate, biomass production\nand stress resistance. Heterosis has become a very useful tool in global\nagriculture, but its genetic basis remains controversial and its effects hard\nto predict. We have taken a computational approach to studying heterosis,\ndeveloping a simulation of evolution, independent reassortment of alleles and\nhybridization of Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) in a Boolean framework.\nFitness is measured as the ability of a network to respond to external inputs\nin a pre-defined way. Our model reproduced common experimental observations on\nheterosis using only biologically justified parameters. Hybrid vigor was\nobserved and its extent was seen to increase as parental populations diverged,\nup until a point of sudden collapse of hybrid fitness. We also reproduce, for\nthe first time in a model, the fact that hybrid vigor cannot easily be fixed by\nwithin a breeding line, currently an important limitation of the use of hybrid\ncrops. The simulation allowed us to study the effects of three standard models\nfor the genetic basis of heterosis and the level of detail in our model allows\nus to suggest possible warning signs of the impending collapse of hybrid vigor\nin breeding. In addition, the simulation provides a framework that can be\nextended to study other aspects of heterosis and alternative evolutionary\nscenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Sep 2013 15:56:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Dec 2013 15:55:42 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 23 Mar 2015 08:56:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-24"}

It requests synergistic capabilities to tailor the structure\nwith atomic scale precision and to control the catalytic reaction to proceed\nthrough well-defined pathways. Here we leverage on the controlled growth of\nMoS2 atomically thin films to demonstrate that the catalytic activity of MoS2\nfor the hydrogen evolution reaction decreases by a factor of ~4.47 for the\naddition of every one more layer. Similar layer dependence is also found in\nedge-riched MoS2 pyramid platelets. This layer-dependent electrocatalysis can\nbe correlated to the hopping of electrons in the vertical direction of MoS2\nlayers over an interlayer potential barrier, which is found to be 0.119V and\nconsistent with theoretical calculations. Our results point out that increasing\nthe hopping efficiency of electrons in the vertical direction is a key for the\ndevelopment of high-efficiency two-dimensional material catalysts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Sep 2013 02:53:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

This question has been asked many times and there\nare many answers even on the Internet, including on Yahoo Answers. Usually the\nanswer is \"no\". Attempts have been made to assess the physical mass of\ninformation by estimating the mass of electrons feeding the power-guzzling\ncomputers and devices making up the Internet, the result being around 50 gram.\nOther efforts to calculate the mass of information have assumed that each\nelectron involved in signal transfer carries one bit of information, which\nmakes the corresponding mass to be about 10^-5 gram. We address the fundamental\nquestion of minimum mass related to a bit of information from the angles of\nquantum physics and special relativity. Our results indicate that there are\ndifferent answers depending on the physical situation, and sometimes the mass\ncan even be negative. We tend to be skeptical about the earlier mass\nestimations, mentioned above, because our results indicate that the electron's\nmass does not play a role in any one of them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Sep 2013 23:41:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-01"}
