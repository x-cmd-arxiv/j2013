Recently, H2 jets were discovered towards this source,\nmainly towards its southwest, where the H2 1-0 S(1) emission peaks. Therefore,\nthe source was catalogued as the Molecular Hydrogen emission-line object MHO\n2429. In order to study the molecular ambient towards this star-forming site,\nwe observed a region around the aforementioned EGO using the Atacama\nSubmillimeter Telescope Experiment in the 12CO J=3--2, 13CO J=3--2, HCO+\nJ=4--3, and CS J=7--6 lines with an angular and spectral resolution of 22\" and\n0.11 km s-1, respectively. The observations revealed a molecular clump where\nthe EGO is embedded at v_LSR ~ 51 km s-1, in coincidence with the velocity of a\nClass I 95 GHz methanol maser previously detected. Analyzing the 12CO line we\ndiscovered high velocity molecular gas in the range from 34 to 47 km s-1, most\nlikely a blueshifted outflow driven by the EGO. The alignment and shape of this\nmolecular structure coincide with those of the southwest lobe of MHO 2429\nmainly between 46 and 47 km s-1, confirming that we are mapping its CO\ncounterpart.

In this article, we place model-independent\nconstraints on the dark matter temperature to mass ratio, whose square root\ndetermines the dark matter velocity dispersion. We only assume that dark matter\nparticles decoupled kinetically while non-relativistic, when galactic scales\nhad not entered the horizon yet, and that their momentum distribution has been\nMaxwellian since that time.

Moreover, we assume pairwise interactions between the processes\nthat are scheduled by an adversary. The only constraint on the adversary\nscheduler is that it must be fair. In order to allow processes to construct\nnetworks, we let them activate and deactivate their pairwise connections. When\ntwo processes interact, the protocol takes as input the states of the processes\nand the state of the their connection and updates all of them. Initially all\nconnections are inactive and the goal is for the processes, after interacting\nand activating/deactivating connections for a while, to end up with a desired\nstable network.

Previous experiments have shown that the predictive\ninformation (PI) is a good candidate to support autonomous, open-ended learning\nof complex behaviours, because a maximisation of the PI corresponds to an\nexploration of morphology- and environment-dependent behavioural regularities.\nThe idea is that these regularities can then be exploited in order to solve any\ngiven task.

Our explicit calculations\nreveal that the anisotropic fermion velocities flow monotonously to an\nisotropic fixed point in the lowest energy limit in clean graphene.

This source\nshows one of the deepest known silicate absorption features and no polycyclic\naromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission. The model suggests that this object is\npowered by an active galactic nucleus (AGN) with a fairly smooth torus viewed\nalmost edge-on and a very young starburst. According to our model the AGN\ncontributes about 90% of the total luminosity of 1.1 x 10^13 Lo, which is about\na factor of five higher than previous estimates. The large correction of the\nluminosity is due to the anisotropy of the emission of the best fit torus.\nSimilar corrections may be necessary for other local and high-z analogs. This\ncorrection implies that IRAS 08572+3915 at a redshift of 0.05835 may be the\nnearest hyperluminous infrared galaxy and probably the most luminous infrared\ngalaxy in the local (z < 0.2) Universe. IRAS 08572+3915 shows a low ratio of\n[CII] to IR luminosity (log L_[CII]/L_{IR} < -3.8) and a [OI]63um to [CII]158um\nline ratio of about 1 that supports the model presented in this letter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Sep 2013 18:32:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

This phenomenon, called frustration, leads to numerous\nenergetically equivalent magnetic states (ground states), which results in\nexotic states such as spin liquid and spin ice. Here we report an alternative\nsituation: a system that, classically, is to be a liquid in the clean limit\nfreezes into a glassy state induced by quantum fluctuations. The case in point\nis a frustrated magnet in which spins are arranged in a triangular network of\nbi-pyramids. When taking into account quantum corrections, the classical\ndegeneracy is broken into a set of local minima in a rugged energy landscape,\nwhich are separated by large energy barriers, over a finite number of\ndegenerate, periodic, ground states. The appearance of large barriers is due to\nthe absence of local zero-energy modes that are typical in spin-liquid\ncandidate systems. We establish this by mapping the set of local energy minima\nstates into a tiling with colored hexagonal tiles. We show that the system\nexhibits a large number of aperiodic tessellations. The configuration entropy\nof the local minima is extremely sensitive to boundary conditions, scaling with\nthe boundary length rather than its volume. The low temperature thermodynamics\nis also discussed to compare it with other glassy materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Sep 2013 19:07:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

We\npropose to use the proton linac of the European Spallation Source currently\nunder construction in Lund, Sweden to deliver, in parallel with the spallation\nneutron production, a very intense, cost effective and high performance\nneutrino beam. The baseline program for the European Spallation Source linac is\nthat it will be fully operational at 5 MW average power by 2022, producing 2\nGeV 2.86 ms long proton pulses at a rate of 14 Hz. Our proposal is to upgrade\nthe linac to 10 MW average power and 28 Hz, producing 14 pulses/s for neutron\nproduction and 14 pulses/s for neutrino production. Furthermore, because of the\nhigh current required in the pulsed neutrino horn, the length of the pulses\nused for neutrino production needs to be compressed to a few $\\mu$s with the\naid of an accumulator ring. A long baseline experiment using this Super Beam\nand a megaton underground Water Cherenkov detector located in existing mines\n300-600 km from Lund will make it possible to discover leptonic CP violation at\n5 $\\sigma$ significance level in up to 50% of the leptonic Dirac CP-violating\nphase range.

My proof of Arnold's Planetary\nTheorem relies on the rediscovery, during the year 2008, of a symplectic set of\naction-angle variables (described in \\S 4 of my thesis) which perform\nexplicitly the reduction of rotation invariance of the system.

This regularization leads to a set of mixed action-angle\nand rectangular variables analogous to Poincar\\'e' variables but better fitted\nto rotation invariance of the system, since they exhibit a cyclic couple of\nconjugated variables.

This is mainly due to the fact\nthat, albeit straightforward, the involved calculations are quite long, tedious\nand prone to error. The present work is an attempt to facilitate the practical\nuse of the renormalization group equations in model building. To that end, we\nhave developed two completely independent sets of programs written in Python\nand Mathematica, respectively. The Mathematica scripts will be part of an\nupcoming release of SARAH 4. The present article describes the collection of\nPython routines that we dubbed PyR@TE which is an acronym for \"Python\nRenormalization group equations At Two-loop for Everyone\". In PyR@TE, once the\nuser specifies the gauge group and the particle content of the model, the\nroutines automatically generate the full two-loop renormalization group\nequations for all (dimensionless and dimensionful) parameters. The results can\noptionally be exported to Latex and Mathematica, or stored in a Python data\nstructure for further processing by other programs. For ease of use, we have\nimplemented an interactive mode for PyR@TE in form of an IPython Notebook. As a\nfirst application, we have generated with PyR@TE the renormalization group\nequations for several non-supersymmetric extensions of the Standard Model and\nfound some discrepancies with the existing literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Sep 2013 19:48:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-05"}

Our asymmetry parameter, which we refer to as photon asymmetry\n($A_{phot}), was developed as a robust substructure statistic for cluster\nobservations with only a few thousand counts. To demonstrate that photon\nasymmetry exhibits better stability than currently popular power ratios and\ncentroid shifts, we artificially degrade the X-ray image quality by: (a) adding\nextra background counts, (b) eliminating a fraction of the counts, (c)\nincreasing the width of the smoothing kernel, and (d) simulating cluster\nobservations at higher redshift. The asymmetry statistic presented here has a\nsmaller statistical uncertainty than competing substructure parameters,\nallowing for low levels of substructure to be measured with confidence.\nA_{phot} is less sensitive to the total number of counts than competing\nsubstructure statistics, making it an ideal candidate for quantifying\nsubstructure in samples of distant clusters covering wide range of\nobservational S/N.

The\nbottleneck for this transport is at the boundary between the convective\ninterior and the radiative atmosphere; the opacity there sets the global\ncooling rate. Models of planetary evolution are often one-dimensional, such\nthat the radiative-convective boundary (RCB) is defined by a single\ntemperature, pressure, and opacity. In reality the spatially inhomogenous\nstellar heating pattern and circulation in the atmosphere could deform the RCB,\nallowing heat from the interior to escape more efficiently through regions with\nlower opacity. We present an analysis of the degree to which the RCB could be\ndeformed and the resultant change in the evolutionary cooling rate. In this\ninitial work we calculate the upper limit for this effect by comparing an\natmospheric structure in local radiative equilibrium to its 1D equivalent. We\nfind that the cooling through an uneven RCB could be enhanced over cooling\nthrough a uniform RCB by as much as 10-50%. We also show that the deformation\nof the RCB (and the enhancement of the cooling rate) increases with a greater\nincident stellar flux or a lower inner entropy.

Further we find that\nthe Schmidt scaling law, by itself, does not provide an adequate description of\nstar formation activity in GMCs. Because the total number of protostars\nproduced by a cloud is given by the product of Sigma*(A_K) and S'(> A_K), the\ndifferential surface area distribution function, integrated over the entire\ncloud, the cloud's structure plays a fundamental role in setting the level of\nits star formation activity.

The coupling of Sigma*(A_K) with\nthe measured S'(> A_K) in these clouds also produces a steep jump in the SFR\nand protostellar production above A_K ~ 0.8 magnitudes. Finally, we show that\nthere is no global Schmidt law that relates the star formation rate and gas\nmass surface densities between GMCs.

In this study, following\nSheth & van de Weygaert (2004), we formulate an analytical approximate\ndescription of the hierarchical void evolution of growing voids by adopting the\nhalo merging algorithm given by Lacey & Cole (1993) in the Einstein de Sitter\n(EdS) Universe. To do this, we take into account the general volume\ndistribution of voids which consists of two main void processes: merging and\ncollapsing. We show that the volume distribution function can be reduced to a\nsimple form, by neglecting the collapsing void contribution since the collapse\nprocess is negligible for large size voids. Therefore, the void volume fraction\nhas a contribution only from growing voids. This algorithm becomes the analogue\nof the halo merging algorithm. Based on this growing void distribution, we\nobtain the void merging algorithm in which we define and formulate void merging\nand absorption rates, as well as void size and redshift survival probabilities\nand also failure rates in terms of the self similar and currently favored dark\nenergy dominated cold dark matter models in the EdS Universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Sep 2013 20:01:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-23"}

Here, we dissect the molecular\nmechanisms and functional pressures driving heterochromatin formation and\ndosage compensation of the recently formed neo-sex chromosomes of Drosophila\nmiranda. We show that the onset of heterochromatin formation on the neo-Y is\ntriggered by an accumulation of repetitive DNA. The neo-X has evolved partial\ndosage compensation and we find that diverse mutational paths have been\nutilized to establish several dozen novel binding consensus motifs for the\ndosage compensation complex on the neo-X, including simple point mutations at\npre-binding sites, insertion and deletion mutations, microsatellite expansions,\nor tandem amplification of weak binding sites. Spreading of these silencing or\nactivating chromatin modifications to adjacent regions results in massive\nmis-expression of neo-sex linked genes, and little correspondence between\nfunctionality of genes and their silencing on the neo-Y or dosage compensation\non the neo-X. Intriguingly, the genomic regions being targeted by the dosage\ncompensation complex on the neo-X and those becoming heterochromatic on the\nneo-Y show little overlap, possibly reflecting different propensities along the\nancestral chromosome to adopt active or repressive chromatin configurations.\nOur findings have broad implications for current models of sex chromosome\nevolution, and demonstrate how mechanistic constraints can limit evolutionary\nadaptations.

The diffuse radio emission is not associated with the active galactic\nnucleus phenomenon and has no optical counterpart.

Second, the comparison of the planet occurrence rate for multiple\nstars to that for single stars sheds light on the influence of stellar\nmultiplicity on planet formation and evolution. We developed a method of\ndistinguishing planet occurrence rates for single and multiple stars. From a\nsample of 138 bright (KP <13.5) Kepler multi-planet candidate systems, we\ncompared the stellar multiplicity rate of these planet host stars to that of\nfield stars. Using dynamical stability analyses and archival Doppler\nmeasurements, we find that the stellar multiplicity rate of planet host stars\nis significantly lower than field stars for semi-major axes less than 20 AU,\nsuggesting that planet formation and evolution are suppressed by the presence\nof a close-in companion star at these separations. The influence of stellar\nmultiplicity at larger separations is uncertain because of search in-\ncompleteness due to a limited Doppler observation time baseline and a lack of\nhigh resolution imaging observation. We calculated the planet confidence for\nthe sample of mutlti-planet candidates, and find that the planet confidences\nfor KOI 82.01, KOI 115.01, KOI 282.01 and KOI 1781.02 are higher than 99.7% and\nthus validate the planetary nature of these four planet candidates.

Recent\nresearch has shown that the EMD plays a crucial role in studying the potential\nimpact of Demand-Responsive Transportation (DRT) and Mobility-on-Demand (MoD)\nsystems, which are growing paradigms for one-way vehicle sharing where people\ndrive (or are driven by) shared vehicles from a point of origin to a point of\ndestination. While the ubiquitous physical transportation setting is the road\nnetwork, characterized by systems of roads connected together by interchanges,\nmost analytical works about vehicle sharing represent distances between points\nin a plane using the simple Euclidean metric. Instead, we consider the EMD when\nthe ground metric is taken from a class of one-dimensional, continuous metric\nspaces, reminiscent of road networks. We produce an explicit formulation of the\nEarth movers distance given any finite road network R. The result generalizes\nthe EMD with a Euclidean R1 ground metric, which had remained one of the only\nknown non-discrete cases with an explicit formula. Our formulation casts the\nEMD as the optimal value of a finite-dimensional, real-valued optimization\nproblem, with a convex objective function and linear constraints. In the\nspecial case that the input distributions have piece-wise uniform (constant)\ndensity, the problem reduces to one whose objective function is convex\nquadratic. Both forms are amenable to modern mathematical programming\ntechniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Sep 2013 01:34:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 Oct 2013 17:00:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-15"}

One of the\nwidely used methods to estimate these errors is the three-cornered-hat\ntechnique, which can be extended to the N-cornered-hat technique. A critical\npoint of this method is how to properly account for the correlations between\nthe compared catalogues. We present a new approach to solving this problem that\nis suitable for simultaneous investigations of several catalogues. To compute\nthe correlation between two catalogues $A$ and $B$, the differences between\nthese catalogues and a third arbitrary catalogue $C$ are computed. Then the\ncorrelation between these differences is considered as an estimate of the\ncorrelation between catalogues $A$ and $B$. The average value of these\nestimates over all catalogues $C$ is taken as a final estimate of the target\ncorrelation. In this way, an exhaustive search of all possible combinations\nallows one to compute the paired correlations between all catalogues. As an\nadditional refinement of the method, we introduce the concept of weighted\ncorrelation coefficient. This technique was applied to nine recently published\nradio source position catalogues. We found large systematic differences between\ncatalogues, that significantly impact determination of their stochastic errors.\nFinally, we estimated the stochastic errors of the nine catalogues.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Sep 2013 06:41:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-30"}

A common way to respect the NFC is to impose Z_2 symmetry which is\nsoftly broken by a dim-2 operator. Another new way is to introduce local U(1)_H\nHiggs flavor symmetry that distinguishes one Higgs doublet from the other. In\nthis paper, we consider the Higgs phenomenology in Type-I 2HDMs with the U(1)_H\nsymmetry with the simplest U(1)_H assignments that the SM fermions are all\nneutral under U(1)_H, and we make detailed comparison with the ordinary Type-I\n2HDM. After imposing various constraints such as vacuum stability and\nperturbativity as well as the electroweak precision observables and collider\nsearch bounds on charged Higgs boson, we find that the allowed Higgs signal\nstrengths in our model are much broader than those in the ordinary Type-I 2HDM,\nbecause of newly introduced U(1)_H-charged singlet scalar and U(1)_H gauge\nboson. Still the ATLAS data on gg to h to gamma gamma cannot be accommodated.\nOur model could be distinguished from the ordinary 2HDM with the Z_2 symmetry\nin a certain parameter region and some channels. If the couplings of the new\nboson turn out to be close to those in the SM, it would be essential to search\nfor extra U(1)_H gauge boson and/or one more neutral scalar boson to\ndistinguish two models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Sep 2013 08:54:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 28 Dec 2013 17:37:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

The main organizational unit is the nucleosome,\nwhich consists of a histone octamer with DNA wrapped around it. Histone\nproteins are implicated in the regulation of eukaryote genes and they carry\nnumerous reversible post-translational modifications that control DNA-protein\ninteractions and the recruitment of chromatin binding proteins.\nHeterochromatin, the transcriptionally inactive part of the genome, is densely\npacked and contains histone H3 that is methylated at Lys 9 (H3K9me). The\npropagation of H3K9me in nucleosomes along the DNA in chromatin is antagonizing\nby methylation of H3 Lysine 4 (H3K4me) and acetylations of several lysines,\nwhich is related to euchromatin and active genes. We show that the related\nhistone modifications form antagonized domains on a coarse scale. These histone\nmarks are assumed to be initiated within distinct nucleation sites in the DNA\nand to propagate bi-directionally. We propose a simple computer model that\nsimulates the distribution of heterochromatin in human chromosomes. The\nsimulations are in agreement with previously reported experimental observations\nfrom two different human cell lines. We reproduced different types of barriers\nbetween heterochromatin and euchromatin providing a unified model for their\nfunction. The effect of changes in the nucleation site distribution and of\npropagation rates were studied. The former occurs mainly with the aim of\n(de-)activation of single genes or gene groups and the latter has the power of\ncontrolling the transcriptional programs of entire chromosomes. Generally, the\nregulatory program of gene transcription is controlled by the distribution of\nnucleation sites along the DNA string.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Sep 2013 08:55:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-30"}

Moreover, exploiting the\nfact that images acquired for appearance-based SLAM are sequential, GNNS search\ncan be initiated judiciously which helps increase the speedup of the\nquantization process considerably.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Sep 2013 09:25:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-30"}

Such regime of large E and small momentum\ntransfer corresponds to Regge kinematics and is characteristically dominated by\nthe pomeron. From this insight we estimate the jet quenching parameter in the\nhadron medium (largely a pion gas) at the end of the collision, which is\nnaturally small and increases with temperature in line with the gas density.\nThe physics in the quark-gluon plasma/liquid phase is less obvious, and here we\nrevisit a couple of simple estimates that suggest indeed that the\npomeron-mediated interactions are very relevant and should be included in\nanalysis of the jet quenching parameter.

(2012). As a result of this analysis the stability of this\nflow cannot be described by a critical Reynolds number unlike what is atempted\nin previous publications. This apparent contradiction can be resolved by\nlooking at the amplification factor responsible for the amplification of the\nperturbation. For lower Reynolds numbers, the boundary layer flow becomes\nunstable in the de- celeration region of the flow. For higher Reynolds numbers,\ninstability arises also in the acceleration region of the flow, confirming,\nalbeit only qualitatively, an observation in the experiments by Sumer et al.\n(2010).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Sep 2013 13:01:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

In this work, we focus on the unusual mesoscopic properties of\naqueous solutions of a nonionic hydrotrope, namely tertiary butyl alcohol\n(TBA), on addition of various hydrophobic compounds. Aqueous TBA solutions, in\nabout 3 to 8 mol percent TBA concentration range and about 0 to 25 deg.

Correctly modeling and quantifying human mobility is\ncritical for improving epidemic control policies, but may be hindered by\nincomplete data in some regions of the world. Here we explore the opportunity\nof using proxy data or models for individual mobility to describe commuting\nmovements and predict the diffusion of infectious disease. We consider three\nEuropean countries and the corresponding commuting networks at different\nresolution scales obtained from official census surveys, from proxy data for\nhuman mobility extracted from mobile phone call records, and from the radiation\nmodel calibrated with census data. Metapopulation models defined on the three\ncountries and integrating the different mobility layers are compared in terms\nof epidemic observables. We show that commuting networks from mobile phone data\nwell capture the empirical commuting patterns, accounting for more than 87% of\nthe total fluxes. The distributions of commuting fluxes per link from both\nsources of data - mobile phones and census - are similar and highly correlated,\nhowever a systematic overestimation of commuting traffic in the mobile phone\ndata is observed. This leads to epidemics that spread faster than on census\ncommuting networks, however preserving the order of infection of newly infected\nlocations. Match in the epidemic invasion pattern is sensitive to initial\nconditions: the radiation model shows higher accuracy with respect to mobile\nphone data when the seed is central in the network, while the mobile phone\nproxy performs better for epidemics seeded in peripheral locations. Results\nsuggest that different proxies can be used to approximate commuting patterns\nacross different resolution scales in spatial epidemic simulations, in light of\nthe desired accuracy in the epidemic outcome under study.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Sep 2013 15:21:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 27 May 2014 12:36:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-14"}

Among the most interesting\nresults, there is the discovery of a 20-year-long steady fading of Sanduleak's\nstar, a peculiar symbiotic star known to produce the largest stellar jet ever\ndiscovered. We discuss by means of direct examples the crucial need for\nlong-term multi-band observations to get a real understanding of symbiotic and\nother interacting binary stars. We eventually introduce BOMBOLO, a multi-band\nsimultaneous imager for the SOAR 4m Telescope, whose design and construction we\nare currently leading.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Sep 2013 20:05:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

The emergence of the $f$-wave pairing results from the\nsublattice-symmetry-breaking caused by the electric field and the\nferromagnetic-like intra-sublattice spin correlations at low dopings. Due to\nthe enhanced density of states, the superconducting critical temperature of the\nsystem is enhanced by the electric field remarkably.

We classify the string dynamics according to properties of\nthe energy boundary function (effective potential) for the string loop motion.\nWe have found that for NS there exist new types of energy boundary function,\nnamely those with off-equatorial minima. Conversion of the energy of the string\noscillations to the energy of the linear translational motion has been studied.\nSuch a transmutation effect is much more efficient in the NS spacetimes because\nlack of the event horizon. For BH spacetimes efficiency of the transmutation\neffect is only weakly spin dependent.

We produce synthetic system architectures based on\nevidence of modular and hierarchical modular product architectures and known\nmotifs for the interconnection of physical components to software. The system\narchitectures are then subject to various forms of attack. The attacks simulate\nfailure of critical hardware or software. Four types of attack are\ninvestigated: degree centrality, betweenness centrality, closeness centrality\nand random attack. Failure tolerance of the system is measured by a 'robustness\ncoefficient', a topological 'size' metric of the connectedness of the attacked\nnetwork. We find that the betweenness centrality attack results in the most\nsignificant reduction in the robustness coefficient, confirming betweenness\ncentrality, rather than the number of connections (i.e. degree), as the most\nconservative metric of component importance. A counter-intuitive finding is\nthat \"designed\" system architectures, including a bus, ring, and star\narchitecture, are not significantly more failure-tolerant than interconnections\nwith no prescribed architecture, that is, a random architecture.
