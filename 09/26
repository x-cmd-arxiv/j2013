Recent studies that sequenced a very large number of individuals\nobserved an extreme excess of rare variants, and provided clear evidence of\nrecent rapid growth in effective population size, though estimates have varied\ngreatly among studies. All these studies were based on protein-coding genes, in\nwhich variants are also impacted by natural selection. In this study, we\nintroduce targeted sequencing data for studying recent human history with\nminimal confounding by natural selection. We sequenced loci very far from genes\nthat meet a wide array of additional criteria such that mutations in these loci\nare putatively neutral. As population structure also skews allele frequencies,\nwe sequenced a sample of relatively homogeneous ancestry by first analyzing the\npopulation structure of 9,716 European Americans. We employed very high\ncoverage sequencing to reliably call rare variants, and fit an extensive array\nof models of recent European demographic history to the site frequency\nspectrum. The best-fit model estimates ~3.4% growth per generation during the\nlast ~140 generations, resulting in a population size increase of two orders of\nmagnitude. This model fits the data very well, largely due to our observation\nthat assumptions of more ancient demography can impact estimates of recent\ngrowth. This observation and results also shed light on the discrepancy in\ndemographic estimates among recent studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Sep 2013 16:01:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 Nov 2013 22:36:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

The Chandra data reveal\na long (>40 kpc) and narrow tail with a nearly constant width (~3 kpc) to the\nsoutheast of the galaxy, and a leading edge ~1.5 kpc from the galaxy center on\nthe upstream side of the tail. The tail is most likely caused by the nearly\nedge-on stripping of ESO 137-002's ISM by ram pressure, compared to the nearly\nface-on stripping of ESO 137-001 discussed in our previous work. Spectral\nanalysis of individual regions along the tail shows that the gas throughout it\nhas a rather constant temperature, ~1 keV, very close to the temperature of the\ntails of ESO 137-001, if the same atomic database is used. The derived gas\nabundance is low (~0.2 solar with the single-kT model), an indication of the\nmultiphase nature of the gas in the tail. The mass of the X-ray tail is only a\nsmall fraction (<5%) of the initial ISM mass of the galaxy, suggesting that the\nstripping is most likely at an early stage. However, with any of the single-kT,\ndouble-kT and multi-kT models we tried, the tail is always \"over-pressured\"\nrelative to the surrounding ICM, which could be due to the uncertainties in the\nabundance, thermal vs. non-thermal X-ray emission, or magnetic support in the\nICM.

We adopt a resource-theoretic perspective, wherein\nthermodynamics is formulated as a theory of what agents can achieve under a\nparticular restriction, namely, that the only state preparations and\ntransformations that they can implement for free are those that are thermal at\nsome fixed temperature. States that are out of thermal equilibrium are the\nresources. We consider the special case of this theory wherein all systems have\ntrivial Hamiltonians (that is, all of their energy levels are degenerate). In\nthis case, the only free operations are those that add noise to the system (or\nimplement a reversible evolution) and the only nonequilibrium states are states\nof informational nonequilibrium, that is, states that deviate from the\nmaximally mixed state. The degree of this deviation we call the state's\nnonuniformity; it is the resource of interest here, the fuel that is consumed,\nfor instance, in an erasure operation. We consider the different types of state\nconversion: exact and approximate, single-shot and asymptotic, catalytic and\nnoncatalytic. In each case, we present the necessary and sufficient conditions\nfor the conversion to be possible for any pair of states, emphasizing a\ngeometrical representation of the conditions in terms of Lorenz curves. We also\nreview the problem of quantifying the nonuniformity of a state, in particular\nthrough the use of generalized entropies. Quantum state conversion problems in\nthis resource theory can be shown to be always reducible to their classical\ncounterparts, so that there are no inherently quantum-mechanical features\narising in such problems.

De Sitter objected to the\n\"world-matter\" in Einstein's world, and proposed a vacuum solution of\nEinstein's field equations with the cosmological constant and with no\n\"world-matter\". In 1920 the world-matter of Einstein's world was equivalent to\n\"Mach's Ether\", a carrier of the effects of inertia. De Sitter's 1917 solution\npredicted a spectral shift effect. In 1923 Eddington and Weyl adopted De\nSitter's model and studied this effect. Einstein objected to this \"cosmological\nproblem\". In 1922-1927, Friedmann and Lamaitre published dynamical universe\nmodels. Friedmann's model with cosmological constant equal to zero was the\nsimplest general relativity universe. Einstein was willing to accept the\nmathematics, but not the physics of a dynamical universe. In 1929 Hubble\nannounced the discovery that the actual universe is apparently expanding. In\n1931 Einstein accepted Friedmann's model with a cosmological constant equal to\nzero, which he previously abhorred; he claimed that one did not need the\ncosmological term anymore.

To explore this contradiction we start from the working hypothesis\nthat in either model any collective coordinate ansatz which includes a degree\nof freedom similar to the vibrational excitation leads to resonances,\nregardless of whether or not this mode emerges as a solution to the\n(linearized) field equations. To this end we compare numerical results in the\n\\phi^4 and \\phi^6 models that arise from the full set of partial differential\nequations to those from the ordinary differential equations for a collective\ncoordinate ansatz. An inaccuracy in literature formulas for the collective\ncoordinate approach in the \\phi^4 model requires to revisit those calculations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Sep 2013 18:46:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 31 Oct 2013 10:08:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-07"}

This relation has\nbeen studied extensively for early-type galaxies in the local universe to\nconstrain galaxy formation mechanisms. The evolution of the zeropoint of this\nplane has been extended to high redshifts to study the luminosity evolution of\nmassive galaxies, under the assumption of structural homology. In this work, we\nassess this assumption by replacing surface brightness with stellar mass\ndensity and present the evolution of the \"mass FP\" for massive, quiescent\ngalaxies since z~2. By accounting for stellar populations, we thereby isolate\nand trace structural and dynamical evolution. Despite the observed dramatic\nevolution in the sizes and morphologies of massive galaxies since z~3, we find\nthat quiescent galaxies lie on the mass FP out to z~2. In contrast with ~1.4\ndex evolution in the luminosity FP, average residuals from the z~0 mass FP are\nless than ~0.15 dex since z~2. Assuming the Hyde & Bernardi (2009) mass FP\nslope, we find that this minimal offset scales as (1+z)^{-0.095+/-0.043}. This\nresult lends credence to previous studies that derived luminosity evolution\nfrom the FP. Therefore, despite their compact sizes and suggestions that\nmassive galaxies are more disk-like at z~2, the relationship between their\ndynamics and structural properties are consistent with local early-type\ngalaxies.

We find (i) that dark-matter-halo formation is\ngreatly suppressed in voids; there is an exponential downturn at low densities\nin the otherwise power-law matter-to-halo density bias function. Thus, the\nrarity of haloes in voids is akin to the rarity of the largest clusters, and\ntheir abundance is quite sensitive to cosmological parameters. The exponential\ndownturn appears both in an excursion-set model, and in a model in which\nfluctuations evolve in voids as in an open universe with an effective\n$\\Omega_m$ proportional to a large-scale density.

An interesting special case, that\nmay prove use- ful to tackling the general problem, is the\ndiagonal-intersecting case, in which the given family of rectangles is\nintersected by a diagonal. Indeed, Chepoi and Felsner recently gave a factor 6\napproximation algorithm for MHS in this setting, and showed that the duality\ngap is between 3/2 and 6.

Our\nhypothesis, based on previous kinetic modeling studies, is that cooler\natmospheres will show stronger signs of disequilibrium than hotter atmospheres.\nWe verify this with chemistry-transport models and show that planets with\ntemperatures less than $\\sim$1200 K are likely to show the strongest signs of\ndisequilibrium due to the vertical quenching of CO, and that our new approach\nis able to capture this process.

To infer the network topology, a \\textit{dynamic} structural equation\nmodel is adopted to capture the relationship between observed adoption times\nand the unknown edge weights.

To this end, solvers with complementary strengths are\ndeveloped by leveraging (pseudo) real-time sparsity-promoting proximal gradient\niterations, the improved convergence rate of accelerated variants, or reduced\ncomputational complexity of stochastic gradient descent.

In this sense our approach mirrors the move from saliency\ndetection methods to measures of `objectness'. In order to measure the\ncharacterness we develop three novel cues that are tailored for character\ndetection, and a Bayesian method for their integration.

In this paper, using a notion of discrete Ricci curvature for\nMarkov kernels introduced by Ollivier, we establish concentration inequalities\nand finite sample bounds for a class of adaptive Markov chains. After\nestablishing some general results, we give quantitative bounds for\n`multi-level' adaptive algorithms such as the equi-energy sampler.

Since\ninstrumental measurements are generally only available after 1850, temperature\nfields must be reconstructed using paleoclimate archives, known as proxies.\nVarious climate field reconstructions (CFR) methods have been proposed to\nrelate past temperature to such proxy networks. In this work, we propose a new\nCFR method, called GraphEM, based on Gaussian Markov random fields embedded\nwithin an EM algorithm. Gaussian Markov random fields provide a natural and\nflexible framework for modeling high-dimensional spatial fields. At the same\ntime, they provide the parameter reduction necessary for obtaining precise and\nwell-conditioned estimates of the covariance structure, even in the\nsample-starved setting common in paleoclimate applications. In this paper, we\npropose and compare the performance of different methods to estimate the\ngraphical structure of climate fields, and demonstrate how the GraphEM\nalgorithm can be used to reconstruct past climate variations. The performance\nof GraphEM is compared to the widely used CFR method RegEM with regularization\nvia truncated total least squares, using synthetic data. Our results show that\nGraphEM can yield significant improvements, with uniform gains over space, and\nfar better risk properties. We demonstrate that the spatial structure of\ntemperature fields can be well estimated by graphs where each neighbor is only\nconnected to a few geographically close neighbors, and that the increase in\nperformance is directly related to recovering the underlying sparsity in the\ncovariance of the spatial field. Our work demonstrates how significant\nimprovements can be made in climate reconstruction methods by better modeling\nthe covariance structure of the climate field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Sep 2013 01:19:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Apr 2014 00:02:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 22 Oct 2014 05:05:44 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 2 Jun 2015 04:43:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

A proper understanding of\nthis phenomenon is quite challenging since it stems from the reciprocal action\nand reaction between fluid flow, the transition to wetting, mass transport,\nprecipitation, surface growth as well as heat transfer. As a result, the\nexhaustive modeling of such problem is an involved task. Lattice Boltzmann\nsimulations in 2D for capillary infiltration are carried out in the isothermal\nregime taking into account surface reaction and subsequent surface growth.\nPrecisely, for a single capillary in the linear Washburn regime, special\nattention is paid to the retardation for the infiltration process induced by\nthe thickening of the surface behind the contact line of the invading front.\nInterestingly, it turns out that the process of surface growth leading to pore\nclosure marginally depends on the infiltration velocity.

When\nlong-range correlations with a large rapidity gap are subtracted from\nshort-range correlations with a small rapidity gap, the remaining near-side\ndihadron correlations result solely from relics of minijets. Low transverse\nmomentum hadron yields per trigger ($p_T^{\\rm trig} <4$ GeV/$c$, $p_T^{\\rm\nasso}<2$ GeV/$c$) in central heavy-ion collisions are significantly enhanced\nover that in p+p collisions while widths in azimuthal angle remain the same, in\nqualitative agreement with experimental data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Sep 2013 07:08:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 4 Oct 2013 08:18:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-24"}

Recent\nexperiments in a range of technical platforms have demonstrated the basic\nfunctionality of quantum simulation applied to quantum magnetism, quantum phase\ntransitions, and relativistic quantum mechanics. In all cases, the underlying\nhardware platforms restrict the achievable inter-particle interaction, forming\na serious constraint on the ability to realize a versatile, programmable\nquantum simulator. In this work, we address this problem by developing novel\nsequences of unitary operations that engineer desired effective Hamiltonians in\nthe time-domain. The result is a hybrid programmable analog simulator\npermitting a broad class of interacting spin-lattice models to be generated\nstarting only with an arbitrary long-range native inter-particle interaction\nand single-qubit addressing. Specifically, our approach permits the generation\nof all symmetrically coupled translation-invariant two-body Hamiltonians with\nhomogeneous on-site terms, a class which includes all spin-1/2 XYZ chains, but\ngeneralized to include long-range couplings. Building on previous work proving\nthat universal simulation is possible using both entangling gates and\nsingle-qubit unitaries, we show that determining the \"program\" of unitary\npulses to implement an arbitrary spin Hamiltonian can be formulated as a linear\nprogram that runs in polynomial time and scales efficiently in hardware\nresources.

First, it is shown that hyperconifold singularities arise naturally\nin limits of smooth, compact Calabi--Yau threefolds (in particular), when the\ngroup action on the covering space develops a fixed point. The\nZ_n-hyperconifolds---those for which the quotient group is cyclic---are\nclassified, demonstrating a one-to-one correspondence between these\nsingularities and three-dimensional lens spaces L(n,k), which occur as the\nvanishing cycles. The classification is constructive, and leads to a simple\nproof that a Z_n-hyperconifold is mirror to an n-nodal variety. It is then\nargued that all factorial Z_n-hyperconifolds have crepant, projective\nresolutions, and this gives rise to transitions between smooth compact\nCalabi--Yau threefolds, which are mirror to certain conifold transitions.\nFormulae are derived for the change in both fundamental group and Hodge numbers\nunder such hyperconifold transitions.\n  Finally, a number of explicit examples are given, to illustrate how to\nconstruct new Calabi--Yau manifolds using hyperconifold transitions, and also\nto highlight the differences which can occur when these singularities occur in\nnon-factorial varieties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Sep 2013 10:00:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-27"}

We also analyse the radial distribution of CCSNe in these galaxies,\nand determine power-law and exponential fits to CCSN surface density profiles.\nTo probe differences between the SNe of these galaxies and normal spiral\ngalaxies, our results were compared to previous studies with samples dominated\nby normal spiral galaxies where possible.

This reflects a more centrally concentrated\npopulation of massive stars in IR-bright galaxies. Furthermore, this\ncentralisation is dominated by a central excess of type Ibc/IIb SNe. This may\nbe due to a top-heavy initial mass function and/or an enhanced close binary\nfraction in regions of enhanced star formation. Type Ic SNe are most strongly\ncorrelated with Ha light and NUV-bright regions, reflecting the shortest\nlifetime and thus highest mass for type Ic progenitors. Previous studies with\nsamples dominated by normal spiral galaxies have indicated a lower Ibc-Ha\ncorrelation than our results do, which may be due to the central excess of type\nIbc/IIb SNe in our sample. The difference between types II and Ib is minimal,\nsuggesting that progenitor mass is not the dominant factor in determining if a\nSN is of type Ib or II. Similar differences in correlation can be seen in the\nKs-band, with type Ibc/IIb SNe tracing the Ks-band light better than type II in\nour sample.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Sep 2013 10:13:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

Due to such network\ndensification and the intense proliferation of wireless devices, modern\nwireless networks are interference-limited, which motivates the use of\ninterference mitigation and coordination techniques. In this work, we develop a\nstatistical framework to evaluate the performance of multi-tier heterogeneous\nnetworks with successive interference cancellation (SIC) capabilities,\naccounting for the computational complexity of the cancellation scheme and\nrelevant network related parameters such as random location of the access\npoints (APs) and mobile users, and the characteristics of the wireless\npropagation channel. We explicitly model the consecutive events of canceling\ninterferers and we derive the success probability to cancel the n-th strongest\nsignal and to decode the signal of interest after n cancellations. When users\nare connected to the AP which provides the maximum average received signal\npower, the analysis indicates that the performance gains of SIC diminish\nquickly with n and the benefits are modest for realistic values of the\nsignal-to-interference ratio (SIR). We extend the statistical model to include\nseveral association policies where distinct gains of SIC are expected: (i)\nminimum load association, (ii) maxi- mum instantaneous SIR association, and\n(iii) range expansion. Numerical results show the effectiveness of SIC for the\nconsidered association policies. This work deepens the understanding of SIC by\ndefining the achievable gains for different association policies in multi-tier\nheterogeneous networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Sep 2013 10:48:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-27"}

Each agent is interested in selecting a route from the\nspecial source to its terminal minimizing the cost. The mutual influence of the\nagents is determined by a cost sharing mechanism, which evenly splits the cost\nof an edge among all the agents using it for routing. In this paper we provide\nseveral algorithmic and complexity results on finding a Nash equilibrium\nminimizing the value of Rosenthal potential.

However in a ladder network or\ntransmission line, taken to be {\\em infinite right from the beginning}, there\nis no reflected wave (assuming the circuit to be ideal with no discontinuities\nen route). Thus the source while continuously supplying power in the forward\ndirection, does not retrieve it from a reflected wave and unlike in the case of\na finite line, there is a net power loss. This apparently lost energy\nultimately appears in the electromagnetic fields in the reactive elements\n(capacitances and inductances which to begin with had no such stored energy),\nfurther down the line as the incident wave advances forward.

We perform the\nsimulations in the spherical coordinates with different temperature profiles\nand accordingly different rotation profiles. In the cases with a spatially\nconstant temperature, because the rotation frequency is vertically constant in\nthe equilibrium condition, general properties of the turbulence are\nquantitatively similar to those obtained in local shearing box simulations. On\nthe other hand, in the cases with a radially variable temperature profile, the\nvertical differential rotation, which is inevitable in the equilibrium\ncondition, winds up the magnetic field lines, in addition to the usual radial\ndifferential rotation. As a result, the coherent wound magnetic fields\ncontribute to the Maxwell stress in the surface regions. We obtain\nnondimensional density and velocity fluctuations ~0.1-0.2 at the midplane. The\nazimuthal power spectra of the magnetic fields show shallow slopes, ~m^0-\nm^{-1}, than those of velocity and density. We observe intermittent and\nstructured disk winds driven by the Poynting flux associated with the MHD\nturbulence. The Poynting flux originating from magnetic tension is injected\nfrom the regions above a scale height towards both the midplane and the\nsurfaces. Related to this, sound waves are directed to the midplane from the\nsurface regions. The mass accretion mainly occurs near the surfaces and the gas\nnear the midplane slowly moves outward, which causes large-scale meridional\ncirculations. The vertical magnetic fields are also dragged inward in the\nsurface regions, while they stochastically move outward and inward around the\nmidplane.

We also\npresent example experimental spectra from a variety of light sources,\nquantifying the intrinsic efficacy of their spectral distributions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Sep 2013 20:14:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

Data acquisition can be\nperformed using cameras, scanners or sensors. Human physiological biometrics\nsuch as face, eye and ear are good candidates for uniquely identifying an\nindividual. However, human ear scores over face and eye because of certain\nadvantages it has over face. The most challenging phase in human identification\nbased on ear biometric is the segmentation of the ear image from the captured\nimage which may contain many unwanted details. In this work, PDE based image\nprocessing techniques are used to segment out the ear image. Level Set Theory\nbased image processing is employed to obtain the contour of the ear image.

In this paper, we develop a framework to predict\nmobile Apps that are most likely to be used regarding the current device status\nof a smartphone. Such an Apps usage prediction framework is a crucial\nprerequisite for fast App launching, intelligent user experience, and power\nmanagement of smartphones. By analyzing real App usage log data, we discover\ntwo kinds of features: The Explicit Feature (EF) from sensing readings of\nbuilt-in sensors, and the Implicit Feature (IF) from App usage relations. The\nIF feature is derived by constructing the proposed App Usage Graph (abbreviated\nas AUG) that models App usage transitions. In light of AUG, we are able to\ndiscover usage relations among Apps. Since users may have different usage\nbehaviors on their smartphones, we further propose one personalized feature\nselection algorithm. We explore minimum description length (MDL) from the\ntraining data and select those features which need less length to describe the\ntraining data. The personalized feature selection can successfully reduce the\nlog size and the prediction time. Finally, we adopt the kNN classification\nmodel to predict Apps usage. Note that through the features selected by the\nproposed personalized feature selection algorithm, we only need to keep these\nfeatures, which in turn reduces the prediction time and avoids the curse of\ndimensionality when using the kNN classifier. We conduct a comprehensive\nexperimental study based on a real mobile App usage dataset. The results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and show the predictive\ncapability for App usage prediction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Sep 2013 14:44:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-01"}
