Ever since the work of Bardeen & Petterson (1975), it has\nbeen expected that when a fluid fills an orbiting disk, the orbital angular\nmomentum at small radii should then align with the mass's spin. Nearly all\nprevious work has studied this alignment under the assumption that a\nphenomenological \"viscosity\" isotropically degrades fluid shears in accretion\ndisks, even though it is now understood that internal stress in flat disks is\ndue to anisotropic MHD turbulence. In this paper we report a pair of matched\nsimulations, one in MHD and one in pure (non-viscous) HD in order to clarify\nthe specific mechanisms of alignment. As in the previous work, we find that\ndisk warps induce radial flows that mix angular momentum of different\norientation; however, we also show that the speeds of these flows are\ngenerically transonic and are only very weakly influenced by internal stresses\nother than pressure. In particular, MHD turbulence does not act in a manner\nconsistent with an isotropic viscosity. When MHD effects are present, the disk\naligns, first at small radii and then at large; alignment is only partial in\nthe HD case. We identify the specific angular momentum transport mechanisms\ncausing alignment and show how MHD effects permit them to operate more\nefficiently. Lastly, we relate the speed at which an alignment front propagates\noutward (in the MHD case) to the rate at which Lense-Thirring torques deliver\nangular momentum at smaller radii.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Sep 2013 02:10:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

For these clusters\nthe initial conditions before gas expulsion, the characteristic cluster\ndevelopment, its dependence on cluster mass, and the star formation efficiency\n(SFE) are investigated. We perform N-body simulations of the cluster expansion\nprocess after gas expulsion and compare the results with observations. We find\nthat the expansion processes of the observed loose and compact massive clusters\nare driven by completely different physical processes. As expected the\nexpansion of loose massive clusters is largely driven by the gas loss due to\nthe low SFE of ~30%. One new revelation is that all the observed massive\nclusters of this group seem to have a very similar size of 1-3 pc at the onset\nof expansion. It is demonstrated that compact clusters have a much higher\neffective SFE of 60-70% and are as a result much less affected by gas\nexpulsion. Their expansion is mainly driven by stellar ejections caused by\ninteractions between the cluster members. The reason why ejections are so\nefficient in driving cluster expansion is that they occur dominantly from the\ncluster centre and over an extended period of time. Thus during the first 10\nMyr the internal dynamics of loose and compact clusters differ fundamentally.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Sep 2013 07:54:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

Controlling and hence limiting such factors\nhas always been an important but elusive research goal, since the packet degree\ndistribution, which is the main factor driving the complexity, is altered in a\nnon-deterministic way by the random recombinations at the network nodes. In\nthis paper we tackle this problem proposing Band Codes (BC), a novel class of\nnetwork codes specifically designed to preserve the packet degree distribution\nduring packet encoding, ecombination and decoding. BC are random codes over\nGF(2) that exhibit low decoding complexity, feature limited and controlled\ndegree distribution by construction, and hence allow to effectively apply NC\neven in energy-constrained scenarios. In particular, in this paper we motivate\nand describe our new design and provide a thorough analysis of its performance.\nWe provide numerical simulations of the performance of BC in order to validate\nthe analysis and assess the overhead of BC with respect to a onventional NC\nscheme. Moreover, peer-to-peer media streaming experiments with a random-push\nprotocol show that BC reduce the decoding complexity by a factor of two, to a\npoint where NC-based mobile streaming to mobile devices becomes practically\nfeasible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Sep 2013 07:58:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-18"}

The program is then interpreted probabilistically by ENFrame.\n  The realisation of ENFrame required novel contributions along several\ndirections. We propose an event language that is expressive enough to\nsuccinctly encode arbitrary correlations, trace the computation of user\nprograms, and allow for computation of discrete probability distributions of\nprogram variables. We exemplify ENFrame on three clustering algorithms:\nk-means, k-medoids, and Markov Clustering. We introduce sequential and\ndistributed algorithms for computing the probability of interconnected events\nexactly or approximately with error guarantees. Experiments with k-medoids\nclustering of sensor readings from energy networks show orders-of-magnitude\nimprovements of exact clustering using ENFrame over na\\\"ive clustering in each\npossible world, of approximate over exact, and of distributed over sequential\nalgorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Sep 2013 12:02:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-03"}

Combining HFI\ndata with IRAS, the angular auto- and cross frequency power spectrum is\nmeasured from 143 to 3000 GHz, and the auto-bispectrum from 217 to 545 GHz. The\ntotal areas used to compute the CIB power spectrum and bispectrum are about\n2240 and 4400 deg^2, respectively. After careful removal of the contaminants,\nand a complete study of systematics, the CIB power spectrum and bispectrum are\nmeasured with unprecedented signal to noise ratio from angular multipoles\nell~150 to 2500, and ell~130 to 1100, respectively. Two approaches are\ndeveloped for modelling CIB power spectrum anisotropies. The first approach\ntakes advantage of the unique measurements by Planck at large angular scales,\nand models only the linear part of the power spectrum, with a mean bias of dark\nmatter halos hosting dusty galaxies at a given redshift weighted by their\ncontribution to the emissivities. The second approach is based on a model that\nassociates star-forming galaxies with dark matter halos and their subhalos,\nusing a parametrized relation between the dust-processed infrared luminosity\nand (sub-)halo mass. The two approaches simultaneously fit all auto- and cross-\npower spectra very well. We find that the star formation history is well\nconstrained up to z~2. However, at higher redshift, the accuracy of the star\nformation history measurement is strongly degraded by the uncertainty in the\nspectral energy distribution of CIB galaxies. We also find that CIB galaxies\nhave warmer temperatures as redshift increases. The CIB bispectrum is steeper\nthan that expected from the power spectrum, although well fitted by a power\nlaw; this gives some information about the contribution of massive halos to the\nCIB bispectrum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Sep 2013 12:39:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

Because it was not possible to cover everything in only three\nhours, the focus was on Barr's and Deligne's theorems. This explains why the\ncorresponding sections have been given more attention. Section 1 and the\nAppendix were added in an attempt to make this document self-contained and\nunderstandable by a reader with a good knowledge of topos theory.\n  A coherent topos is a topos which is equivalent to a Grothendieck topos that\nadmits a site $(C,J)$ such that $C$ has finite limits and there exists a base\nof $J$ with finite covering families. In order to prove that any coherent topos\nhas enough points, it is enough to show that for any coherent topos\n$\\mathcal{E}$ there is a surjective geometric morphism from a topos with enough\npoints to $\\mathcal{E}$.

The conceptual understanding of relativistic Bohmian\nmechanics is significantly enriched by this classical insight. In particular,\nthe analogy between classical and Bohmian mechanics suggests the interpretation\nof Bohmian scalar time as a quantum proper time different from the classical\none, the two being related by a nonlocal scale factor calculated from the wave\nfunction.

As such, it does not aim at reviewing\nthe status of the field, at covering all possible ramifications of the approach\nor at presenting recent achievements and applications. The objective is to\nprovide a modern account of the nuclear EDF formalism that is at variance with\ntraditional presentations that rely, at one point or another, on a {\\it\nHamiltonian-based} picture. The latter is not general enough to encompass what\nthe nuclear EDF method represents as of today. Specifically, the traditional\nHamiltonian-based picture does not allow one to grasp the difficulties\nassociated with the fact that currently available parametrizations of the\nenergy kernel $E[g',g]$ at play in the method do not derive from a genuine\nHamilton operator, would the latter be effective. The method is formulated from\nthe outset through the most general multi-reference, i.e. beyond mean-field,\nimplementation such that the single-reference, i.e. \"mean-field\", derives as a\nparticular case. As such, a key point of the presentation provided here is to\ndemonstrate that the multi-reference EDF method can indeed be formulated in a\n{\\it mathematically} meaningful fashion even if $E[g',g]$ does {\\it not} derive\nfrom a genuine Hamilton operator. In particular, the restoration of symmetries\ncan be entirely formulated without making {\\it any} reference to a projected\nstate, i.e. within a genuine EDF framework. However, and as is illustrated in\nthe present document, a mathematically meaningful formulation does not\nguarantee that the formalism is sound from a {\\it physical} standpoint.

Lower bounds are derived for the reconstruction error of a single\nnormally or uniformly-distributed finite-dimensional vector imperfectly\nmeasured by a network of sensors and transmitted with finite energy to a common\nreceiver via an additive white Gaussian noise asynchronous multiple-access\nchannel. Transmission makes use of a perfect causal feedback link to the\nencoder connected to each sensor. A retransmission protocol inspired by the\nclassical scheme in [1] applied to the transmission of single and bi-variate\nanalog samples analyzed in [2] and [3] is extended to the more general network\nscenario, for which asymptotic upper-bounds on the reconstruction error are\nprovided.

The latter includes\na minor modification of the protocol to improve reconstruction fidelity.\nNumerical results show that an increase in the size of the network brings\nbenefit in terms of performance, but that the gain in terms of energy\nefficiency diminishes quickly at finite energies due to a non-coherent\ncombining loss.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Sep 2013 15:59:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-20"}

The objective is to\nminimize the total tardiness by determining the allocation and sequence of jobs\non identical parallel machines. In this problem, the processing time of each\njob is a step function dependent upon its starting time. An individual extended\ntime is penalized when the starting time of a job is later than a specific\ndeterioration date. The possibility of deterioration of a job makes the\nparallel machine scheduling problem more challenging than ordinary ones. A\nmixed integer programming model for the optimal solution is derived. Due to its\nNP-hard nature, a hybrid discrete cuckoo search algorithm is proposed to solve\nthis problem. In order to generate a good initial swarm, a modified heuristic\nnamed the MBHG is incorporated into the initialization of population. Several\ndiscrete operators are proposed in the random walk of L\\'{e}vy Flights and the\ncrossover search. Moreover, a local search procedure based on variable\nneighborhood descent is integrated into the algorithm as a hybrid strategy in\norder to improve the quality of elite solutions. Computational experiments are\nexecuted on two sets of randomly generated test instances. The results show\nthat the proposed hybrid algorithm can yield better solutions in comparison\nwith the commercial solver CPLEX with one hour time limit, discrete cuckoo\nsearch algorithm and the existing variable neighborhood search algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Sep 2013 03:34:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-06"}

Conversely, we show that any other Boolean function can appear as a\nfaulty response from an irredundant realization of some root function under\ncertain stuck-at faults. We characterize this new class of functions and show\nthat for n variables, their number is exactly equal to the number of\nindependent dominating sets (Harary and Livingston, Appl. Math.
