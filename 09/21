One particular challenge for\ninference under linear models is understanding the conditions on the dictionary\nunder which reliable inference is possible. This challenge has attracted\nrenewed attention in recent years since many modern inference problems deal\nwith the \"underdetermined\" setting, in which the number of observations is much\nsmaller than the number of columns in the dictionary. This paper makes several\ncontributions for this setting when the set of observations is given by a\nlinear combination of a small number of groups of columns of the dictionary,\ntermed the \"block-sparse\" case. First, it specifies conditions on the\ndictionary under which most block subdictionaries are well conditioned. This\nresult is fundamentally different from prior work on block-sparse inference\nbecause (i) it provides conditions that can be explicitly computed in\npolynomial time, (ii) the given conditions translate into near-optimal scaling\nof the number of columns of the block subdictionaries as a function of the\nnumber of observations for a large class of dictionaries, and (iii) it suggests\nthat the spectral norm and the quadratic-mean block coherence of the dictionary\n(rather than the worst-case coherences) fundamentally limit the scaling of\ndimensions of the well-conditioned block subdictionaries. Second, this paper\ninvestigates the problems of block-sparse recovery and block-sparse regression\nin underdetermined settings. Near-optimal block-sparse recovery and regression\nare possible for certain dictionaries as long as the dictionary satisfies\neasily computable conditions and the coefficients describing the linear\ncombination of groups of columns can be modeled through a mild statistical\nprior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Sep 2013 16:21:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 14 Dec 2014 01:39:19 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 28 Apr 2015 16:56:33 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 28 Aug 2016 20:15:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-06"}

In fact, taming the Mott\ninsulator-to-metal transition (IMT), which is driven by strong electronic\ncorrelation effects, holds the promise of a commutation speed set by a quantum\ntransition, and with negligible power dissipation. In this context, one\npossible route to control the Mott transition is to electrostatically dope the\nsystems using strong dielectrics, in FET-like devices. Another possibility is\nthrough resistive switching, that is, to induce the insulator-to-metal\ntransition by strong electric pulsing. This action brings the correlated system\nfar from equilibrium, rendering the exact treatment of the problem a difficult\nchallenge. Here, we show that existing theoretical predictions of the\noff-equilibrium manybody problem err by orders of magnitudes, when compared to\nexperiments that we performed on three prototypical narrow gap Mott systems\nV2-xCrxO3, NiS2-xSex and GaTa4Se8, and which also demonstrate a striking\nuniversality of this Mott resistive transition (MRT).

However, when we\nhave learned to recognize a foreign accent, it seems plausible that recognition\nof a word rarely involves reconstruction of the speech gestures of the speaker\nrather than the listener. To better assess the motor theory and this\nobservation, we proceed in three stages. Part 1 places the motor theory of\nspeech perception in a larger framework based on our earlier models of the\nadaptive formation of mirror neurons for grasping, and for viewing extensions\nof that mirror system as part of a larger system for neuro-linguistic\nprocessing, augmented by the present consideration of recognizing speech in a\nnovel accent. Part 2 then offers a novel computational model of how a listener\ncomes to understand the speech of someone speaking the listener's native\nlanguage with a foreign accent. The core tenet of the model is that the\nlistener uses hypotheses about the word the speaker is currently uttering to\nupdate probabilities linking the sound produced by the speaker to phonemes in\nthe native language repertoire of the listener. This, on average, improves the\nrecognition of later words. This model is neutral regarding the nature of the\nrepresentations it uses (motor vs. auditory). It serve as a reference point for\nthe discussion in Part 3, which proposes a dual-stream neuro-linguistic\narchitecture to revisits claims for and against the motor theory of speech\nperception and the relevance of mirror neurons, and extracts some implications\nfor the reframing of the motor theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Sep 2013 16:47:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-23"}

We conclude that fidelity as a tool to assess quantum\nresources should be employed with caution, possibly combined with additional\nconstraints restricting the pool of achievable states, or only as a mere\nsummary of a full tomographic reconstruction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Sep 2013 17:05:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Oct 2013 10:20:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 6 Jan 2014 21:12:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

As a consequence they obey relatively simple differential equations\nwhich describe birth and death phenomena resulting from mesoscopic and\nmicroscopic physicochemical processes. Using the probability theory, it is thus\npossible to give a physical meaning to their empirical coefficients, to\ncalculate well defined quantities and to compare the results obtained from\ndifferent isotherms.

As a consequence, one can\ndetermine which types of measurements can possibly inhibit the exponential\ndecay of the system. We find that continuous monitoring taken as the limit of a\nsequence of ideal measurements will only inhibit decay in special cases, such\nas in well-controlled experiments. Uncontrolled monitoring of an unstable\nsystem, however, can cause exponentially decreasing non-decay probability at\nall times. Furthermore, calculating the decay rate for a general sequence of\nobservations leads to a straightforward derivation of Fermi's Golden Rule, that\navoids many of the conceptual difficulties normally encountered. When multiple\ndecay channels are available, the derivation reveals how the total decay rate\nnaturally partitions into a sum of the decay rates for the various channels, in\nagreement with observations.

The first method\ninvolves multiplying and dividing a basic augmented density with polynomials in\n$r$ and constructing more complex augmented densities in the process, from\nwhich we obtain the double-power distribution functions. This procedure is\napplied to a specific case of the Veltmann models that is known to closely\napproximate the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile, and also to the Plummer and\nHernquist profiles (in the appendix). The second part of the paper is concerned\nwith obtaining hypervirial distribution functions, i.e. distribution functions\nthat satisfy the local virial theorem, for several well-known models. In order\nto construct the hypervirial augmented densities and the corresponding\ndistribution functions, we start with an appropriate ansatz for the former and\nproceed to determine the coefficients appearing in that ansatz by expanding the\npotential--density pair as a series, around $r=0$ and $r=\\infty$. By doing so,\nwe obtain hypervirial distribution functions, valid in these two limits, that\ncan generate the potential--density pairs of these models to an arbitrarily\nhigh degree of accuracy. This procedure is explicitly carried out for the\nH\\'enon isochrone, Jaffe, Dehnen and NFW models and the accuracy of this\nprocedure is established.

For a SUSY\nbenchmark model with a standard underabundance (SUA) of Higgsino-like dark\nmatter (DM), we find for the PQ scale f_a< 10^{12} GeV that the DM abundance is\nmainly comprised of axions as the saxion/axino decay occurs before the standard\nneutralino freeze-out and thus its abundance remains suppressed.

In order to quantify these constraints, as well as to assess\nthe compatibility with available nuclear data from fixed target experiments and\nfrom RHIC, the traditional strategy is to perform a global fit of nuclear PDFs.\nThis procedure is however time consuming and technically challenging, and\nmoreover can only be performed by the PDF fitters themselves. In the case of\nproton PDFs, an alternative approach has been suggested that uses Bayesian\ninference to propagate the effects of new data into the PDFs without the need\nof refitting. In this work, we apply this reweighting procedure to study the\nimpact on nuclear PDFs of low-mass Drell-Yan and single-inclusive\nhadroproduction pseudo-data from proton-lead collisions at the LHC as\nrepresentative examples. In the hadroproduction case, in addition we assess the\npossibility of discriminating between the DGLAP and CGC production frameworks.\nWe find that the LHC proton-lead data could lead to a substantial reduction of\nthe uncertainties on nuclear PDFs, in particular for the small-x gluon PDF\nwhere uncertainties could decrease by up to a factor two.

Conversly, the\neffect of length on the sense mode frequency is dominant. The resonance\nfrequencies, kinetic energy ratios, scale factors of gyroscope are compared to\nevaluate the mode quality. The results show that the kinetic energy in y-axis\ndirection of the drive mode and the kinetic energy in z-axis direction of the\nsense mode increase with the thickness of the PZT block, and consequently the\nscale factor of the gyroscope increases.

Specifically, there is a sequence of random\nvariables whose probability density function will change at an unknown time.\nThe goal is to detect this change in a way such that a linear combination of\nthe average detection delay and the false alarm probability is minimized. Two\ntypes of sampling right constrains are discussed. The first one is a limited\nsampling right constraint, in which the observer can take at most $N$\nobservations from this random sequence. Under this setup, we show that the cost\nfunction can be written as a set of iterative functions, which can be solved by\nMarkov optimal stopping theory. The optimal stopping rule is shown to be a\nthreshold rule. An asymptotic upper bound of the average detection delay is\ndeveloped as the false alarm probability goes to zero. This upper bound\nindicates that the performance of the limited sampling right problem is close\nto that of the classic Bayesian quickest detection for several scenarios of\npractical interest. The second constraint discussed in this paper is a\nstochastic sampling right constraint, in which sampling rights are consumed by\ntaking observations and are replenished randomly. The observer cannot take\nobservations if there are no sampling rights left. We characterize the optimal\nsolution, which has a very complex structure. For practical applications, we\npropose a low complexity algorithm, in which the sampling rule is to take\nobservations as long as the observer has sampling rights left and the detection\nscheme is a threshold rule.

Any\nsingle-field models without ghost-like instabilities fall into this\ndescription: from canonical, to Dirac-Born-Infeld inflation and galileon\ninflation theories. We investigate the scale and shape- dependences of the\nbispectrum to next-order in the slow-roll approximation. We illustrate our\nresults by applying them to different models and argue these corrections must\nbe taken into account to keep the theoretical error below the observational\nprecision set by the Planck satellite. We then explore the ability of using\nbispectrum shapes to distinguish between inflationary models more efficiently.\nWe further extend the study of the bispectrum of single-field models beyond the\nslow-roll approximation, demanding the spectral index to be close to, but not\nexactly, unity. In the second part of this thesis we explore the process by\nwhich the universe is repopulated with matter particles at the end of a\nDirac-Born-Infeld inflation phase. We place some mild bounds on the reheating\ntemperature of these models. We argue that the constraints arising from the\npreheating analysis are complementary to those derived from the primordial\nperturbation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Sep 2013 21:28:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-24"}

This uncertainty stems from a dearth of observational\nconstraints as well as the great dynamic range between the small scales (<1 pc)\nwhere the feedback occurs and the large scales of galaxies (>1 kpc) that are\nshaped by this feedback. To bridge this divide, in this paper we aim to assess\nobservationally the role of stellar feedback at the intermediate scales of HII\nregions. In particular, we employ multiwavelength data to examine several\nstellar feedback mechanisms in a sample of 32 HII regions in the Large and\nSmall Magellanic Clouds (LMC and SMC, respectively). Using optical, infrared,\nradio, and X-ray images, we measure the pressures exerted on the shells from\nthe direct stellar radiation, the dust-processed radiation, the warm ionized\ngas, and the hot X-ray emitting gas. We find that the warm ionized gas\ndominates over the other terms in all of the sources, although two have\ncomparable dust-processed radiation pressures to their warm gas pressures. The\nhot gas pressures are comparatively weak, while the direct radiation pressures\nare 1-2 orders of magnitude below the other terms. We discuss the implications\nof these results, particularly highlighting evidence for hot gas leakage from\nthe HII shells and regarding the momentum deposition from the dust-processed\nradiation to the warm gas. Furthermore, we emphasize that similar observational\nwork should be done on very young HII regions to test whether direct radiation\npressure and hot gas can drive the dynamics at early times.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Sep 2013 03:10:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Sep 2014 18:35:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

On the one hand, classical analysis of two-player games involves an\nadversary (modeling the environment of the system) which is purely antagonistic\nand asks for strict guarantees. On the other hand, stochastic models like\nMarkov decision processes represent situations where the system is faced to a\npurely randomized environment: the aim is then to optimize the expected payoff,\nwith no guarantee on individual outcomes. We introduce the beyond worst-case\nsynthesis problem, which is to construct strategies that guarantee some\nquantitative requirement in the worst-case while providing an higher expected\nvalue against a particular stochastic model of the environment given as input.\nThis problem is relevant to produce system controllers that provide nice\nexpected performance in the everyday situation while ensuring a strict (but\nrelaxed) performance threshold even in the event of very bad (while unlikely)\ncircumstances. We study the beyond worst-case synthesis problem for two\nimportant quantitative settings: the mean-payoff and the shortest path. In both\ncases, we show how to decide the existence of finite-memory strategies\nsatisfying the problem and how to synthesize one if one exists. We establish\nalgorithms and we study complexity bounds and memory requirements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Sep 2013 05:44:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Oct 2013 18:30:41 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 2 Jan 2014 10:13:00 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 29 Oct 2014 18:31:34 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 30 Oct 2015 16:37:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-02"}

Patchy H-alpha emission discovered along the Magellanic Stream over\nthe SGP is a factor of 5 too bright to have been produced by the Galactic\nstellar population. Time-dependent models of Stream clouds exposed to a flare\nin ionising photon flux show that the ionised gas must recombine and cool for a\ntime interval 0.6 - 2.9 Myr for the emitted H-alpha surface brightness to drop\nto the observed level. A nuclear starburst is ruled out. Sgr A* is a more\nlikely candidate because it is two orders of magnitude more efficient at\nconverting gas to UV radiation. The central black hole (4 x 10^6 Msun) can\nsupply the required ionising luminosity with a fraction of the Eddington\naccretion rate (3-30%). In support of nuclear activity, the H-alpha emission\nalong the Stream has a polar angle dependence peaking close to the SGP.\nMoreover, it is now generally accepted that the Stream over the SGP must be\nfurther than the Magellanic Clouds. At the lower halo gas densities, shocks\nbecome too ineffective and are unlikely to give rise to a polar angle\ndependence in the H-alpha emission.

The satellite\ngalaxy has coplanar or polar disc orientation in relation to the disc of the\nprimary galaxy and their initial orbits are prograde eccentric ($e=0.1$,\n$e=0.4$ or $e=0.7$). Both galaxies have mass and size comparable to the Milky\nWay. We show that the merger of the two disc galaxies, depending on the\nrelative orientation of the discs, can yield either a disc or lenticular\nremnant, instead of an elliptical one. These are the first simulations in the\nliterature to show the formation of S0-like galaxies from protracted binary\ngalaxy interactions. Additionally, we demonstrate that the time to merger\nincreases linearly with the initial apocentric distance between the galaxies,\nand decreases with the initial orbital eccentricity. We also show that the\ntidal forces of the discs excite transient $m=1$ and $m=2$ wave modes, i.e.,\nlopsidedness, spiral arms, and bars. However, after the merging of the discs,\nsuch instabilities fade completely, and the remnant is thicker and bigger than\nthe original discs. The maximum relative amplitude of these waves is at most\nabout 15 times greater compared to the control case. of these two wave modes.\nFinally, the disc settles down quickly, after the merger, in less than one\nouter disc rotation period.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Sep 2013 09:48:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 16 May 2014 19:58:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-15"}

By reviewing and extending an approach that moves from very\ncoarse-grained to more detailed models, we show that, a fundamental requirement\nfor a body supporting fluctuation-induced allostery is a strongly inhomogeneous\nelastic modulus.

In first part of the work, using\nthe well known LWPC technique, we simulated the flare induced excess lower\nionospheric electron density by amplitude perturbation method. Unperturbed\nD-region electron density is also obtained from simulation and compared with\nIRI-model results. Using these simulation results and time delay as key\nparameters, we calculate the effective electron recombination coefficient\n($\\alpha_{eff}$) at solar flare peak region.

The advantage of the\nCS-THz is its reduced acquisition time compared with the raster scan mode.\nHowever, when it applied to large-scale two-dimensional (2D) imaging, the\nincreased dimension resulted in both high computational complexity and\nexcessive memory usage. In this paper, we introduced a novel CS-based THz\nimaging system that progressively compressed the THz image column by column.\nTherefore, the CS-THz system could be simplified with a much smaller sized\nmodulator and reduced dimension. In order to utilize the block structure and\nthe correlation of adjacent columns of the THz image, a complex-valued block\nsparse Bayesian learning algorithm was proposed. We conducted systematic\nevaluation of state-of-the-art CS algorithms under the scan based CS-THz\narchitecture. The compression ratios and the choices of the sensing matrices\nwere analyzed in detail using both synthetic and real-life THz images.\nSimulation results showed that both the scan based architecture and the\nproposed recovery algorithm were superior and efficient for large scale CS-THz\napplications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Sep 2013 23:08:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-25"}

Self-seeding by a forward Bragg diffraction (FBD) monochromator\nhas been recently proposed [1] and demonstrated [2]. Characteristic time To of\nFBD determines the power, spectral, and time characteristics of the FBD seed\n[3]. Here we show that for a given electron bunch with duration sigma_e the\nspectral flux of the self-seeding XFEL can be maximized, and the spectral\nbandwidth can be respectively minimized by choosing To ~ sigma_e/pi and by\noptimizing the electron bunch delay tau_e. The choices of To and tau_e are not\nunique. In all cases, the maximum value of the spectral flux and the minimum\nbandwidth are primarily determined by sigma_e. Two-color seeding takes place To\n>> sigma_e/\\pi. The studies are performed, for a Gaussian electron bunch\ndistribution with the parameters, close to those used in the short-bunch\n(sigma_e ~ 5 fs) and long-bunch (sigma_e ~ 20 fs) operation modes of the LCLS\nXFEL.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Sep 2013 21:23:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-03"}
