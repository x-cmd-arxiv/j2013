To\naccomplish this, we first present an implementation of the dual-fermion (DF)\napproach based on the hybridization expansion continuous-time quantum Monte\nCarlo impurity solver (CT-HYB), which allows us to consistently compare the\nlocal and non-local descriptions of this model. We find that, the inclusion of\nnon-locality restores the self-energy dispersion of the conduction electrons,\n{\\it i.e.} the $\\vec{k}$ dependence of $\\Sigma(\\vec{k}, i\\omega_{n})$. The\nanti-ferromagnetic correlations result in an additional symmetry in\n$\\Sigma(\\vec{k}, i\\omega_{n})$, which is well described by the N\\'eel\nantiferromagnetic wave-vector. A \"metal\"-\"anti-ferromagnetic insulator\"-\"Kondo\ninsulator\" transition is observed at finite temperatures, which is driven by\nthe competition of the effective RKKY interaction (at the weak coupling regime)\nand the Kondo singlet formation mechanism (at the strong coupling regime). Away\nfrom half-filling, the anti-ferromagnetic phase becomes unstable against hole\ndoping. The system tends to develop a ferromagnetic phase with the spin\nsusceptibility $\\chi_{s}(Q)$ peaking at $Q=\\Gamma$.

Recently, several groups reported\nexperimental data suggesting that signatures of Majorana modes in topological\ninsulator Josephson junctions (TIJJs) have -- indeed -- been observed. To\nverify this claim, one needs to study the topological properties of low-energy\nAndreev-bound states (ABS) in TIs of which the Majorana modes are a special\ncase. It has been shown theoretically that topologically non-trivial low-energy\nABS are also present in TIJJs with doped topological insulators up to some\ncritical level of doping at which the system undergoes a topological phase\ntransition. Here, we present first experimental evidence for this topological\ntransition in the bulk band of a doped TI. Our theoretical calculations, and\nnumerical modeling link abrupt changes in the critical current of top-gated\nTIJJs to moving the chemical potential in the charge-accumulation region on the\nsurface of the doped TI across a band-inversion point. We demonstrate that the\ncritical-current changes originate from a shift of the spatial location of\nlow-energy ABS from the surface to the boundary between topologically-trivial\nand band-inverted regions after the transition. The appearance of a decay\nchannel for surface ABS is related to the vanishing of the band effective mass\nin the bulk and thus exemplifies the topological character of surface ABS as\nboundary modes. Importantly, the mechanism suggest a means of manipulating\nMajorana modes in future experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 31 Aug 2013 22:03:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-27"}

A star is said to be in\ndynamic equilibrium if it is a stationary, axisymmetric solution to the\nEinstein-fluid equations with circular flow. We prove that for a star in\ndynamic equilibrium, the necessary and sufficient condition for thermodynamic\nequilibrium (extremum of total entropy S) is constancy of angular velocity\n(\\Omega), redshifted temperature, and redshifted chemical potential. Friedman\npreviously identified positivity of canonical energy, E, as a criterion for\ndynamic stability and argued that all rotating stars are dynamically unstable\nto sufficiently nonaxisymmetric perturbations (the CFS instability), so our\nmain focus is on axisymmetric stability. We show that for a star in dynamic\nequilibrium, mode stability holds with respect to all axisymmetric\nperturbations if E is positive on a certain subspace, V, of axisymmetric\nLagrangian perturbations that, in particular, have no Lagrangian change in\nangular momentum density. Conversely, if E fails to be positive on V, then\nthere exist perturbations that can't become asymptotically stationary at late\ntimes. We further show that for a star in thermodynamic equilibrium, the\ncanonical energy in the rotating frame, E_r, is related to second order changes\nin ADM mass, M, and angular momentum, J, by E_r = \\delta^2 M - \\Omega \\delta^2\nJ. Thus, positivity of E_r for perturbations with \\delta J = 0 is a necessary\ncondition for thermodynamic stability (local maximum of S). For axisymmetric\nperturbations we have E = E_r, so a necessary condition for thermodynamic\nstability with respect to axisymmetric perturbations is positivity of E on all\nperturbations with \\delta J = 0, not merely on the perturbations in V.

Graphene would thus appear to alleviate some of the drawbacks\nassociated with silicon-based transistors. It is for this reason why such a\nmaterial is considered one of the most prominent candidates to replace silicon\nwithin nano-scale transistors.

Existing methods include nano-ribbons, bilayer and multi-layer\nstructures, carbon nanotubes, as well as the usage of the graphene substrates.\nGraphene transistors can generally be classified according to two working\nprinciples. The first is that a single graphene layer, nanoribbon or carbon\nnanotube can act as a transistor channel, with current being transported along\nthe horizontal axis. The second mechanism is regarded as tunneling, whether\nthis be band-to-band on a single graphene layer, or vertically between adjacent\ngraphene layers.

State-of-the-art BIQA\nmethods typically require subjects to score a large number of images to train a\nrobust model. However, subjective quality scores are imprecise, biased, and\ninconsistent, and it is challenging to obtain a large scale database, or to\nextend existing databases, because of the inconvenience of collecting images,\ntraining the subjects, conducting subjective experiments, and realigning human\nquality evaluations. To combat these limitations, this paper explores and\nexploits preference image pairs (PIPs) such as \"the quality of image $I_a$ is\nbetter than that of image $I_b$\" for training a robust BIQA model. The\npreference label, representing the relative quality of two images, is generally\nprecise and consistent, and is not sensitive to image content, distortion type,\nor subject identity; such PIPs can be generated at very low cost. The proposed\nBIQA method is one of learning to rank. We first formulate the problem of\nlearning the mapping from the image features to the preference label as one of\nclassification. In particular, we investigate the utilization of a multiple\nkernel learning algorithm based on group lasso (MKLGL) to provide a solution. A\nsimple but effective strategy to estimate perceptual image quality scores is\nthen presented. Experiments show that the proposed BIQA method is highly\neffective and achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art BIQA\nalgorithms. Moreover, the proposed method can be easily extended to new\ndistortion categories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Sep 2013 12:26:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 Sep 2013 01:52:03 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 24 Apr 2019 00:26:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-25"}

We\nhave previously shown that ligand-receptor based Turing mechanisms can also\nresult from BMP-receptor and GDNF-receptor interactions, and that these\nreproduce the wildtype and mutant patterns during digit formation in limbs and\nbranching morphogenesis in lung and kidneys. Receptor-ligand interactions may\nthus constitute a general mechanism to generate Turing patterns in nature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Sep 2013 14:32:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

The discovery of the oxidation of Xe extended\nthe doctrinal boundary of chemistry that a complete shell is inert to reaction.\nThe oxidations of Xe by various geological substances have been researched in\norder to explain the missing Xe in earth atmosphere. Among many proposals, the\nchemistry mechanisms are straightforward as they identify chemical processes\nthat can capture Xe in earth interior. However, all the mechanisms based on\ncurrent noble gas chemistry face the same difficulty: the earth lower mantle\nand core are rich in metals and therefore their chemical environment is\nreductive. On the other hand, up till now, the opposite chemical inclination,\nthe reductive propensity, i.e. gaining electrons and forming anions, has not\nbeen proposed and examined for noble gas elements. In this work, we\ndemonstrate, using first principles calculations and an efficient structure\nprediction method, that Xe and Kr can form stable MgXe and MgKr compounds under\nhigh pressure. These compounds are intermetallic and Xe or Kr is negatively\ncharged. We also find that elevated temperature has large effect in stabilizing\nMgXe and MgKr compounds. Our results show that the earth has the capability of\ncapturing Xe but not Kr, which is consistent to the depletion of Xe in earth\natmosphere. The stability of these compounds suggests that chemical species\nwith completely filled shell may still gain more electrons filling their outer\nshell in chemical reactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Sep 2013 04:24:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 Sep 2013 23:08:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-16"}
