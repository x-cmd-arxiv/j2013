We investigate the dynamics and stability of post-shock\nplasma streaming along nonuniform stellar magnetic fields at the impact region\nof accretion columns. We study how the magnetic field configuration and\nstrength determine the structure, geometry, and location of the shock-heated\nplasma. METHODS. We model the impact of an accretion stream onto the\nchromosphere of a CTTS by 2D axisymmetric magnetohydrodynamic simulations. Our\nmodel takes into account the gravity, the radiative cooling, and the\nmagnetic-field-oriented thermal conduction. RESULTS. The structure, stability,\nand location of the shocked plasma strongly depend on the configuration and\nstrength of the magnetic field. For weak magnetic fields, a large component of\nB may develop perpendicular to the stream at the base of the accretion column,\nlimiting the sinking of the shocked plasma into the chromosphere. An envelope\nof dense and cold chromospheric material may also develop around the shocked\ncolumn. For strong magnetic fields, the field configuration determines the\nposition of the shock and its stand-off height. If the field is strongly\ntapered close to the chromosphere, an oblique shock may form well above the\nstellar surface. In general, a nonuniform magnetic field makes the distribution\nof emission measure vs. temperature of the shocked plasma lower than in the\ncase of uniform magnetic field. CONCLUSIONS. The initial strength and\nconfiguration of the magnetic field in the impact region of the stream are\nexpected to influence the chromospheric absorption and, therefore, the\nobservability of the shock-heated plasma in the X-ray band. The field strength\nand configuration influence also the energy balance of the shocked plasma, its\nemission measure at T > 1 MK being lower than expected for a uniform field. The\nabove effects contribute in underestimating the mass accretion rates derived in\nthe X-ray band.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Sep 2013 16:18:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

The downlink\nMulti-User Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MU-MIMO) technique, supported by the\nlatest IEEE amendment-802.11ac, is considered as one of the key enhancements\nleading WLANs to the Gigabit era. However, as cloud uploading services,\nPeer-to-Peer (P2P) and telepresence applications get popular, the need for a\nhigher uplink capacity becomes inevitable.\n  In this paper, a unified down/up-link Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol\ncalled Uni-MUMAC is proposed to enhance the performance of IEEE 802.11ac WLANs\nby exploring the multi-user spatial multiplexing technique. Specifically, in\nthe downlink, we implement an IEEE 802.11ac-compliant MU-MIMO transmission\nscheme to allow the AP to simultaneously send frames to a group of STAs. In the\nuplink, we extend the traditional one round channel access contention to two\nrounds, which coordinate multiple STAs to transmit frames to the AP\nsimultaneously. 2-nd round Contention Window (CW2nd), a parameter that makes\nthe length of the 2-nd contention round elastic according to the traffic\ncondition, is introduced. Uni-MUMAC is evaluated through simulations in\nsaturated and non-saturated conditions when both downlink and uplink traffic\nare present in the system. We also propose an analytic saturation model to\nvalidate the simulation results. By properly setting CW2nd and other\nparameters, Uni-MUMAC is compared to a prominent multi-user transmission scheme\nin the literature.

Under this\nassumption, we prove that the expected SFS of a sample uniquely determines the\nunderlying demographic model, provided that the sample is sufficiently large.\nWe obtain a general bound on the sample size sufficient for identifiability;\nthe bound depends on the number of pieces in the demographic model and also on\nthe type of population size function in each piece.

In the field of quantum molecular\ndynamics, the effective interaction between the atoms is often described by\npotential energy surfaces (PES), and it is necessary to fit such PES into the\ndesired structure. For high-dimensional systems, the current approaches for\nthis fitting process either lead to fits that are too large to be practical, or\ntheir accuracy is difficult to predict and control.\n  This article introduces multi-layer Potfit (MLPF), a novel fitting scheme\nthat results in a PES representation in the hierarchical tensor (HT) format.\nThe scheme is based on the hierarchical singular value decomposition, which can\nyield a near-optimal fit and give strict bounds for the obtained accuracy.\nHere, a recursive scheme for using the HT-format PES within ML-MCTDH is\nderived, and theoretical estimates as well as a computational example show that\nthe use of MLPF can reduce the numerical effort for ML-MCTDH by orders of\nmagnitude, compared to the traditionally used Potfit representation of the PES.\nMoreover, it is shown that MLPF is especially beneficial for high-accuracy PES\nrepresentations, and it turns out that MLPF leads to computational savings\nalready for comparatively small systems with just four modes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Sep 2013 17:45:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Oct 2013 14:51:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 21 Nov 2013 12:25:52 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 8 Jan 2014 15:07:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-09"}

A\nhierarchical matrix approach is adopted for this purpose. In order to model\nlarge-scale molecular structures these methods should be applied over wide\nfrequency spectra. Here we introduce a novel parametric hierarchical matrix\nmethod that allows one for a rapid construction of a wideband system\nrepresentation and enables an efficient wideband solution. We apply the\ndeveloped method to the modeling of the optical response of bacteriochorophyll\ntubular aggregates as found in green photosynthetic bacteria. We show that the\nparametric method can provide one with the frequency and time-domain solutions\nfor structures of the size of 100, 000 molecules, which is comparable to the\nsize of the whole antenna complex in a bacterium. The absorption spectrum is\ncalculated and the significance of electrodynamic retardation effects for\nrelatively large structures, i.e. with respect to the wavelength of light, is\nbriefly studied.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Sep 2013 18:54:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-29"}

We use the mean-field systems to analyze adaptation\ninduced bursting under realistic sources of heterogeneity in multiple\nparameters. Our analysis demonstrates that the presence of heterogeneity causes\nthe Hopf bifurcation associated with the emergence of bursting to change from\nsub-critical to super-critical.

Models of continuous star-formation within\nclusters, lasting for hundreds of Myr, are ruled out at high significance\n(unless stellar IMF variations are invoked). Models for the (nearly\ninstantaneous) formation of a secondary population within an existing first\ngeneration are not favoured, but are not formally discounted due to the finite\nsampling of age/mass-space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Sep 2013 20:02:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

Such arrangement may facilitate signal amplification and the\nintegration of multiple stimuli. However, this organization likely also affects\nthe kinetics of signaling since the cytoplasmic enzymes that modulate the\nactivity of the receptors must localize to the cluster prior to receptor\nmodification. Here we examine how these spatial considerations shape signaling\ndynamics at rest and in response to stimuli. As a model, we use the chemotaxis\npathway of Escherichia coli, a canonical system for the study of how organisms\nsense, respond, and adapt to environmental stimuli. In bacterial chemotaxis,\nadaptation is mediated by two enzymes that localize to the clustered receptors\nand modulate their activity through methylation-demethylation. Using a novel\nstochastic simulation, we show that distributive receptor methylation is\nnecessary for successful adaptation to stimulus and also leads to large\nfluctuations in receptor activity in the steady state. These fluctuations arise\nfrom noise in the number of localized enzymes combined with saturated\nmodification kinetics between localized enzymes and receptor substrate. An\nanalytical model explains how saturated enzyme kinetics and large fluctuations\ncan coexist with an adapted state robust to variation in the expression level\nof the pathway constituents, a key requirement to ensure the functionality of\nindividual cells within a population. This contrasts with the well-mixed\ncovalent modification system studied by Goldbeter and Koshland in which mean\nactivity becomes ultrasensitive to protein abundances when the enzymes operate\nat saturation. Large fluctuations in receptor activity have been quantified\nexperimentally.

The observed skyrmions are extended objects\nwith typical linear sizes of 10 nm to 100 nm that contain $10^3$ to $10^5$\nspins and can be deformed in response to external perturbations. Weak\ndeformations are characterized by the internal modes which are localized around\nthe skyrmion center. Knowledge of internal modes is crucial to assess the\nstability and rigidity of these topological textures. Here we compute the\ninternal modes of a skyrmion in the ferromagnetic background state by numerical\ndiagonalization of the dynamical matrix. We find several internal modes below\nthe magnon continuum, such as the mode corresponding to the translational\nmotion, and different kinds of breathing modes. The number of internal modes is\nlarger for lower magnetic fields. Indeed, several modes become gapless in the\nlow field region indicating that the single skyrmion solution becomes unstable,\nalthough a skyrmion lattice is thermodynamically stable. On the other hand, at\nhigh fields only three internal modes exist and the skyrmion is stable even at\nhigher fields when the ferromagnetic state is thermodynamically stable. We also\nshow that the presence of out-of-plane easy-axis anisotropy stabilizes the\nsingle skyrmion solution.

But the initial conformation of neck linker (specially the three amino\nacids of the extra turn) and the neck linker docking initiation mechanism\nremain unclear. By using molecular dynamics method, we investigate the initial\nconformation of kinesin's neck linker in the docking process.

We also prove several convexity properties of $d_T$ and some\nresults concerning the topology of $d_T$, including a brief study of the\n$d_T$-convergence of monotone sequences. It is shown most of the results are\ntrue without any assumption of an Archimedean-type property for $K$. One\nconsiders various completeness properties and one studies the relations between\nthem. Since $d_T$ is defined in the context of a generic ordered linear space,\nwith no need of an underlying topological structure, one expects to express its\ncompleteness in terms of properties of the ordering, with respect to the linear\nstructure. This is done in this paper and, to the best of our knowledge, this\nhas not been done yet.

In contrast, essential plasticity, the dominant class,\ntends to be inter-pathway but strongly localized and unveils Cell Envelope\nBiosynthesis as an essential backup for Membrane Lipid Metabolism. When\ncomparing E. coli and Mycoplasma pneumoniae, we find that the metabolic\nnetworks of the two organisms exhibit a large difference in the relative\nimportance of plasticity and redundancy which is consistent with the conjecture\nthat plasticity is a sophisticated mechanism that requires a complex\norganization.

In dynamical problems the time-dependent equations of\nradiation hydrodynamics have to be solved.

The solver is based on the flux-limited diffusion approximation in the\ntwo-temperature approach. All equations are solved in the co-moving frame in\nthe frequency independent (grey) approximation. The hydrodynamics is solved by\nthe different Godunov schemes implemented in PLUTO, and for the radiation\ntransport we use a fully implicit scheme. The resulting system of linear\nequations is solved either using the successive over-relaxation (SOR) method\n(for testing purposes), or matrix solvers that are available in the PETSc\nlibrary. We state in detail the methodology and describe several test cases in\norder to verify the correctness of our implementation. The solver works in\nstandard coordinate systems, such as Cartesian, cylindrical and spherical, and\nalso for non-equidistant grids.

Such systems are rare but powerful\nlaboratories for studying AGB nucleosynthesis as we can measure the chemical\nabundances of both the polluted star and the nebula ejected by the polluter.\nHere we present evidence for a barium star in the PN Hen 2-39. The polluted\ngiant is very similar to that found in WeBo 1. It is a cool (Teff=4250 +/- 150\nK) giant enhanced in carbon ([C/H]=0.42 +/- 0.02 dex) and barium ([Ba/Fe]=1.50\n+/- 0.25 dex). A spectral type of C-R3 C_24 nominally places Hen 2-39 amongst\nthe peculiar early R-type carbon stars, however the barium enhancement and\nlikely binary status mean that it is more likely to be a barium star with\nsimilar properties, rather than a true member of this class. An AGB star model\nof initial mass 1.8 Msun and a relatively large carbon pocket size can\nreproduce the observed abundances well, provided mass is transferred in a\nhighly conservative way from the AGB star to the polluted star (e.g. wind\nRoche-lobe overflow). The nebula exhibits an apparent ring morphology in\nkeeping with the other PNe around barium stars (WeBo 1 and A 70) and shows a\nhigh degree of ionization implying the presence of an invisible hot pre-WD\ncompanion that will require confirmation with UV observations.

Random and\nsmall-scale magnetic fields are generated by turbulence. We further determine\nthat the polarization property of GRB prompt emission is governed by the\nconfiguration of the random and small-scale magnetic fields. A two-dimensional\ncompressed slab, which contains stochastic magnetic fields, is applied in our\nmodel. If the jitter condition is satisfied, the electron deflection angle in\nthe magnetic field is very small and the electron trajectory can be treated as\na straight line. A high-degree of polarization can be achieved when the angle\nbetween the line of sight and the slab plane is small.

The jet\n\"off-axis\" effect is intensely sensitive to the observed polarization degree.\nWe discuss the depolarization effect on GRB prompt emission and afterglow.

Strong pressure-broadened Na and K absorption signatures are also\nexcluded, as are significant metal-hydride features. We compare our combined\nbroadband spectrum to a wide variety of existing aerosol-free atmospheric\nmodels, though none are satisfactory fits. However, we do find that the full\ntransmission spectrum can be described by models which include significant\nopacity from aerosols: including Rayleigh scattering, Mie scattering, tholin\nhaze, and settling dust profiles. The transmission spectrum follows an\neffective extinction cross section with a power-law of index alpha, with the\nslope of the transmission spectrum constraining the quantity alphaT =\n-3528+/-660 K, where T is the atmospheric temperature. Rayleigh scattering\n(alpha=-4) is among the best fitting models, though requires low terminator\ntemperatures near 900 K. Sub-micron size aerosol particles can provide equally\ngood fits to the entire transmission spectrum for a wide range of temperatures,\nand we explore corundum as a plausible dust aerosol.

Ti-bearing condensates on the cooler night-side is the most natural\nexplanation for the overall lack of TiO signatures in WASP-12b, indicating the\nday/night cold-trap is an important effect for very hot Jupiters.

Croton\nbase numbers can be combined to form the amplitudes and phases of Mersenne\nfluctuations which, in turn, form qphyla.

Unlike\nconventional methods where the value function is regressed on a set of basis\nfunctions valued at the beginning of the interval, the \"Regress-Later\" method\nregresses the value function on a set of basis functions valued at the end of\nthe interval. The conditional expectation across the interval is then computed\nexactly for each basis function.

Despite decades of\nefforts, many aspects of the physics of relativistic jets remain elusive. In\nparticular, the location and the mechanisms responsible for the high-energy\nemission and the connection of the variability at different wavelengths are\namong the greatest challenges in the study of AGN. From the comparison of the\nradio and gamma-ray light curves of gamma-ray flaring objects, there is\nevidence that some flares, either in radio or in gamma rays, have not an\nobvious connection at the other extreme of the electromagnetic spectrum, like\nin the case of the Narrow-Line Seyfert 1 SBS 0846+513. An intriguing aspect\npointed out by high resolution radio observations is the change of the\npolarization properties close in time with some high energy flares. In\nparticular, in PKS 1510-089 and 3C 454.3 a rotation of almost 90 degrees has\nbeen observed after strong gamma-ray flares.

A thread creates a future to hold the results of a\ncomputation, which may or may not be executed in parallel. That result is\nreturned when some thread touches that future, blocking if necessary until the\nresult is ready.\n  Recent research has shown that while futures can, of course, enhance\nparallelism in a structured way, they can have a deleterious effect on cache\nlocality. In the worst case, futures can incur $\\Omega(P T_\\infty + t\nT_\\infty)$ deviations, which implies $\\Omega(C P T_\\infty + C t T_\\infty)$\nadditional cache misses, where $C$ is the number of cache lines, $P$ is the\nnumber of processors, $t$ is the number of touches, and $T_\\infty$ is the\n\\emph{computation span}. Since cache locality has a large impact on software\nperformance on modern multicores, this result is troubling.\n  In this paper, however, we show that if futures are used in a simple,\ndisciplined way, then the situation is much better: if each future is touched\nonly once, either by the thread that created it, or by a thread to which the\nfuture has been passed from the thread that created it, then parallel\nexecutions with work stealing can incur at most $O(C P T^2_\\infty)$ additional\ncache misses, a substantial improvement. This structured use of futures is\ncharacteristic of many (but not all) parallel applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Sep 2013 15:30:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 Mar 2014 19:43:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 10 Apr 2017 04:07:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-11"}

We show that this tool, first introduced in\nturbulence two decades ago, proves to be very useful in understanding the\nevolution of the cosmic web structure, and in classifying its morphology.\nBefore shell-crossing, different categories of potential flow are highly\nassociated with cosmic web structure, because of the coherent evolution of\ndensity and velocity. This correspondence is even preserved at some level when\nvorticity is generated after shell-crossing. The evolution from the potential\nto vortical flow can be traced continuously by these invariants. With the help\nof this tool, we show that the vorticity is generated in a particular way that\nis highly correlated with the large-scale structure. This includes a distinct\nspatial distribution and different types of alignment between cosmic web and\nvorticity direction for various vortical flows.

Recent results from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Project\n(WMAP) indicate that the visible universe is incredibly flat. This apparent\nflatness could be due to the fact that only a small part of the universe is\nvisible, thus indicating that the geometry of the universe is still an open and\nan interesting problem in cosmology. Assuming a profound connection between\nFriedmann, Robertson, Walker (FRW) geometries and thermodynamics, we construct\na parameter free exploratory model that allows us to predict the geometry of\nthe universe by thermodynamic arguments. The key parameters in this model are\nthe concept of global equation of state and the concept of gravitational\ntemperature. By comparing the equal time expansion of the Green function for\nthe massless conformal scalar field in background FRW geometry with the thermal\nGreen function in Minkowski space-time, we define the gravitational\ntemperature. We also give the protocol for determining the global equation of\nstate for a given local equation of state. Using a local equation of state that\ncovers a wide range of physically acceptable cases,\nP={\\alpha}{\\rho},{\\alpha}>0, and within the context of FRW thermodynamics, we\npredict that the geometry of the visible universe is Lobachevskian (open),\nalbeit being very close to flat. This is consistent with the WMAP data, which\nindicates that the universe may deviate from flatness by as much as 1%. We also\ndiscuss the self-consistency of this suggestive model along with its possible\nconnections with nonextensive thermodynamics and black hole thermodynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Sep 2013 20:42:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-24"}

On the\nbasis of this algebra the elements of the analysis, i.e. the theory of\n4-dimensional functions of the 4-dimensional variable are built up. In the\nprocess of designing the analysistwo additional assumptions aboutthe properties\nof functions are made. Obtained under different assumptionsabout the properties\nof functions, the Cauchy-Riemann equations are solved in flat, spherically and\ncylindrically symmetric cases. In the cylindrically symmetric case the wave\nsolutions were obtained both for the metric tensor and for the 4-dimensional\nfunction. Both waves spreadwith the speed equal to unity along null geodesics.\nThe properties of the metric tensor as physically real object are postulated,\nbut the idea what the 4-dimensional function (vector field) is remains unclear.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Sep 2013 14:05:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-19"}
