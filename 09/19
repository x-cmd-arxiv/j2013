Nonmonotonicity--e.g. as indicated by a lack of similarity of\nsuccessive sketches--is not evidence of a selectionist process; Darwin's theory\nexplains adaptive change, not nonmonotonicity. Although the notion of blindness\noriginally implied randomness, it now encompasses phenomena that bias idea\ngeneration, e.g. the influence of remote associations on sketch ideas. However,\nfor a selectionist framework is to be applicable, such biases must be\nnegligible, otherwise evolutionary change is attributed to those biases, not to\nselection. The notion of 'variants' should not be applied to creativity;\nwithout a mechanism of inheritance, there is no basis upon which to delineate,\nfor example, which sketch ideas are or are not variants of a given sketch idea.\nThe notion of selective retention is also problematic. Selection provides an\nexplanation when acquired change is not transmitted; it cannot apply to\nPicasso's painting (or other creative acts) because his ideas acquired\nmodifications as he thought them through that were incorporated into paintings\nand viewed by others. The generation of one sketch affects the criteria by\nwhich the next is judged, so sequentially generated sketches cannot be treated\nas members of a generation, and selected amongst. Although BVSR is\ninappropriate as a theoretical framework for creativity, exploring to what\nextent selectionism explains the generation of not just biological form but\nmasterpieces such as Picasso's Guernica is useful for gaining insight into\ncreativity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Sep 2013 16:16:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 30 Jun 2019 02:25:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-02"}

And if so,\ndoes it evolve through natural selection, or by some other means? Why does no\nother species remotely approach the degree of cultural complexity of humans?\nThese questions lie at the foundation of who we are and what makes our lives\nmeaningful. Although much research has been done on how selective pressures\noperating at the biological level affect cognition and culture, little research\nhas focused on culture as an evolutionary process in its own right. Like\nbiological forms, cultural forms-ideas, attitudes, artifacts, mannerisms,\netc.-incrementally adapt to the constraints and affordances of their\nenvironment through descent with modification. In some respects culture appears\nto be Darwinian, i.e., a process of differential replication and selection\namongst randomly generated variants. This suggests that knowledge of biological\nevolution can be put to use to gain insight into culture. However, attempts to\napply Darwinian theory to culture have not yielded the kind of unifying\nframework for the social sciences that it provided for the biological sciences,\nlargely because of the nonrandom manner in which the mind-the hub of cultural\nchange-generates and assimilates novelty.

Managing human-machine interaction is a problem of\nconsiderable scope, and the simplification of human-robot interfaces is\nespecially important in the domains of biomedical technology and rehabilitation\nmedicine. For example, amputees who control artificial limbs are often required\nto quickly switch between a number of control actions or modes of operation in\norder to operate their devices. We suggest that by learning to anticipate\n(predict) a user's behaviour, artificial limbs could take on an active role in\na human's control decisions so as to reduce the burden on their users.\nRecently, we showed that RL in the form of general value functions (GVFs) could\nbe used to accurately detect a user's control intent prior to their explicit\ncontrol choices. In the present work, we explore the use of temporal-difference\nlearning and GVFs to predict when users will switch their control influence\nbetween the different motor functions of a robot arm. Experiments were\nperformed using a multi-function robot arm that was controlled by muscle\nsignals from a user's body (similar to conventional artificial limb control).\nOur approach was able to acquire and maintain forecasts about a user's\nswitching decisions in real time. It also provides an intuitive and reward-free\nway for users to correct or reinforce the decisions made by the machine\nlearning system. We expect that when a system is certain enough about its\npredictions, it can begin to take over switching decisions from the user to\nstreamline control and potentially decrease the time and effort needed to\ncomplete tasks. This preliminary study therefore suggests a way to naturally\nintegrate human- and machine-based decision making systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Sep 2013 17:29:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-19"}

As a consequence, there is a prima facie argument exploiting\nentanglement that CTC interactions would enable superluminal and, indeed,\neffectively instantaneous signaling. In cases of spacelike separation between\nthe sender of a signal and the receiver, whether a receiver measures the local\npart of an entangled state or a disentangled state to access the signal can\ndepend on the reference frame. We propose a consistency condition that gives\npriority to either an entangled perspective or a disentangled perspective in\nspacelike separated scenarios. For D-CTC interactions, the consistency\ncondition gives priority to frames of reference in which the state is\ndisentangled, while for P-CTC interactions the condition selects the entangled\nstate. Using the consistency condition, we show that there is a procedure that\nallows Alice to signal to Bob in the past via relayed superluminal\ncommunications between spacelike separated Alice and Clio, and spacelike\nseparated Clio and Bob. This opens the door to time travel paradoxes in the\nclassical domain.

In contrast,\nthe superconductor-to-insulator transition takes place at a finite critical\ndisorder (on the order of V_c ~ 2t), where V is the typical width of the\ndistribution of random site energies and t is the hopping scale. In this\narticle we compare the localization/delocalization properties of one and two\nparticles. Whereas the metal-insulator transition is a consequence of\nsingle-particle Anderson localization, the superconductor-insulator transition\n(SIT) is due to pair localization - or, alternatively, fluctuations of the\nphase conjugate to pair density. The central question we address is how\nsuperconductivity emerges from localized single-particle states. We address\nthis question using inhomogeneous mean field theory and quantum Monte Carlo\ntechniques and make several testable predictions for local spectroscopic probes\nacross the SIT. We show that with increasing disorder, the system forms\nsuperconducting blobs on the scale of the coherence length embedded in an\ninsulating matrix. In the superconducting state, the phases on the different\nblobs are coherent across the system whereas in the insulator long-range phase\ncoherence is disrupted by quantum fluctuations. As a consequence of this\nemergent granularity, we show that the single-particle energy gap in the\ndensity of states survives across the transition, but coherence peaks exist\nonly in the superconductor. A characteristic pseudogap persists above the\ncritical disorder and critical temperature, in contrast to conventional\ntheories. Surprisingly, the insulator has a two-particle gap scale that\nvanishes at the SIT despite a robust single-particle gap.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Sep 2013 16:57:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-20"}

Often they show\ncoordinated variability at different frequencies, suggesting that in these\ncases the same population of electrons is at work, in a single zone of the jet.\nThe location of this region along the jet is a matter of debate. The jet power\ncorrelates with the mass accretion rate, with jets existing at all values of\ndisk luminosities, measured in Eddington units, sampled so far. The most\npowerful blazars show clear evidence of the emission from their disks, and this\nhas revived methods of finding the black hole mass and accretion rate by\nmodelling a disk spectrum to the data. Being so luminous, blazars can be\ndetected also at very high redshift, and therefore are a useful tool to explore\nthe far universe. One interesting line of research concerns how heavy are their\nblack holes at high redshifts. If we associate the presence of a relativistic\njet with a fastly spinning black hole, then we naively expect that the\naccretion efficiency is larger than for non-spinning holes. As a consequence,\nthe black hole mass in jetted systems should grow at a slower rate. In turn,\nthis would imply that, at high redshifts, the heaviest black holes should be in\nradio-quiet quasars.

However, an accurate estimation\nof the CMB power spectrum faces many challenges as the CMB experiments\nsensitivity increases. Furthermore, for polarization experiments the precision\nof measurement is complicated by the fact that the polarisation signal is very\nfaint compared to the measured total intensity, and could be impossible to\ndetect in the presence of high level of systematics. One of the most important\nsource of errors in CMB polarization experiment is the beam asymmetry. For\nlarge data set the estimation of the CMB polarization power spectrum with\nstandard optimal Maximum Likelihood (ML) is prohibitive for high resolution CMB\nexperiments due to the enormous required computation time. In this paper, we\npresent a semi-analytical framework using the pseudo-$C_{l}$ estimator to\ncompute the power spectrum TE of the temperature anisotropy and the E-component\nof the polarization radiation field using non-circular beams. We adopt a model\nof beams obtained from a perturbative expansion of the beam around a circular\n(axisymmetric) one in harmonic space, and compute the resulting bias matrix\nwhich relates the true power spectrum with the observed one using an efficient\nalgorithm for rapid computation. We show that for a multipole up to\n$l_{max}=500$, the bias matrix can be computed in less than one second with a\nsingle CPU processor at 2.53 GHz.

The results are\ninterpreted within the scenario of the spin-state crossover from a\nroom-temperature mixture of the intermediate spin Co$^{3+}$ and low spin\nCo$^{4+}$ (IS/LS) at the to the LS/LS mixture in the sample ground states. In\ncontrast to the yttrium free $y=0$ that retains the metallic-like character and\nexhibits ferromagnetic ordering below 55 K, the doped system $y=0.15$ undergoes\na first-order metal-insulator transition at 132 K, during which not only the\ncrossover to low spin states but also a partial electron transfer from\nPr$^{3+}$ 4f to cobalt 3d states take place simultaneously. Taking into account\nthe non-magnetic character of LS Co$^{3+}$, such valence shift electronic\ntransition causes a magnetic dilution, formally to 0.12 LS Co$^{4+}$ or 0.12\n$t_{2g}$ hole spins per f.u., which is the reason for an insulating, highly\nnon-uniform magnetic ground state without long-range order.

Photons which arrive during the brief\nperiod in which the image frame is transferred for read out of the CCD are\ndisplaced in the transfer direction in the recorded images. For sufficiently\nbright sources, these displaced counts form read-out streaks. Using UVOT\nobservations of Tycho-2 stars, we investigate the use of these read-out streaks\nto obtain photometry for sources which are too bright (and hence have too much\ncoincidence loss) for normal aperture photometry to be reliable. For\nread-out-streak photometry, the bright-source limiting factor is coincidence\nloss within the MCPs rather than the CCD. We find that photometric measurements\ncan be obtained for stars up to 2.4 magnitudes brighter than the usual\nfull-frame coincidence-loss limit by using the read-out streaks. The resulting\nbright-limit Vega magnitudes in the UVOT passbands are UVW2=8.80, UVM2=8.27,\nUVW1=8.86, u=9.76, b=10.53, v=9.31 and White=11.71; these limits are\nindependent of the windowing mode of the camera. We find that a photometric\nprecision of 0.1 mag can be achieved through read-out streak measurements. A\nsuitable method for the measurement of read-out streaks is described and all\nnecessary calibration factors are given.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Sep 2013 22:57:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

The Pareto exponent was treated as the fractal dimension of\nsize distribution of cities, while the Zipf exponent was treated as the\nreciprocal of the fractal dimension. However, this viewpoint is not exact. In\nthis paper, I will present a new interpretation of the scaling exponent of\nrank-size distributions. The ideas from fractal measure relation and the\nprinciple of dimension consistency are employed to explore the essence of\nPareto's and Zipf's scaling exponents. The Pareto exponent proved to be a ratio\nof the fractal dimension of a network of cities to the average dimension of\ncity population. Accordingly, the Zipf exponent is the reciprocal of this\ndimension ratio. On a digital map, the Pareto exponent can be defined by the\nscaling relation between a map scale and the corresponding number of cities\nbased on this scale. The cities of the United States of America in 1900, 1940,\n1960, and 1980 and Indian cities in 1981, 1991, and 2001 are utilized to\nillustrate the geographical spatial meaning of Pareto's exponent. The results\nsuggest that the Pareto exponent of city-size distribution is not a fractal\ndimension, but a ratio of the urban network dimension to the city population\ndimension.

However, these approaches,\nand others based on nonstandard smoothing methods, complicate the process of\ninference, for example, by requiring the choice of new, unconventional\nsmoothing parameters and, in the case of undersmoothing, producing relatively\nwide bands.

Moreover, depending on\nalgorithmic parameters, conventional algorithms including distributed\ninterference alignment (DIA) may not provide sub-stream fairness, and generate\nsub-streams with poor signal-to-interference plus noise ratios (SINRs), thus\nwith poor bit error rates (BERs). To this end, we propose a distributed power\ncontrol algorithm to render sub-stream fairness in the system, and establish\ninitiatory connections between sub-stream SINRs, BERs, and rates. Algorithms\nhave particular responses to parameters. In the paper, important algorithmic\nparameters are analyzed to exhibit numerical correctness in benchmarking. The\ndistinction between separate filtering schemes that design each stream of a\nuser separately and group filtering schemes that jointly design the streams of\na user is also underscored in the paper. Finally, the power control law used in\nthe proposed algorithm is proven to linearly converge to a unique fixed-point,\nand the algorithm is shown to achieve feasible SINR targets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Sep 2013 06:42:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

However, the role of mechanical approaches in tumor therapy is largely\nneglected, while the currently available cancer prevention and treatment\nmethods are generally either expensive or just cause too much side effect. In\nthis article, we present a systematic interpretation on a promising strategy\nwhich was termed here as Mechanical Therapy for the first time based on the\nfact that mechanical force closely accompanies the whole life (growth and\ndeath) of a cell, and plays a crucial role in biological functions. In order to\nmold the mechanical force as a practical tool for cancer therapy, we expound\nthe effects of the mechanical force related to the tumors from molecule to\ntissue level and evaluate its feasibility for treatment purpose. It can be\nconceived that given enough investigations, the mechanical therapy may generate\nbig potential to open new windows for cancer prevention, relieving or even\ndestroying if well administrated. As an easy going and convenient method, a\nsystematic and thorough study of mechanical therapy may clarify more options\nfor future clinical practices. Besides, when patients encounter various forces\nin daily life, they can at least identify the good or bad forces for a better\nand healthy life style based on the mechanisms thus disclosed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Sep 2013 08:56:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-20"}

Among\nthese substrates are graphane (abbreviated GH), which has an H atom bonded to\neach C atom, and fluorographene (GF). For the graphite case, extensive\nexperimental and theoretical investigations have revealed that the phase\ndiagrams of the bose gases 4He and para-H2 are qualitatively similar, differing\nprimarily in a higher characteristic temperature scale for H2 than for He. The\nphase behaviors of these films on one side of pristine graphene, or both sides\nof free-standing graphene, are expected to be similar to those on graphite. We\npoint out the possibility of novel phenomena in adsorption on graphene related\nto the large flexibility of the graphene sheet, to the non--negligible\ninteraction between atoms adsorbed on opposite sides of the sheet and to the\nperturbation effect of the adsorbed layer on the Dirac electrons. In contrast,\nthe behaviors predicted on GF and GH surfaces are very different from those on\ngraphite, a result of the different corrugation, i.e., the lateral variation of\nthe potential experienced by these gases. As a result of this novel geometry\nand potential, distinct properties are observed. For example, the 4He film's\nground-state on graphite is a two-dimensional (2D) crystal commensurate with\nthe substrate; on GF and GH, instead, it is predicted to be an anisotropic\nsuperfluid. On GF the anisotropy is so extreme that the roton excitations are\nvery anisotropic, as if the bosons are moving in a multiconnected space along\nthe bonds of a honeycomb lattice. Such a novel phase has not been predicted or\nobserved previously on any substrate. Also, in the case of 3He the film's\nground-state is a fluid, thus offering the possibility of studying an\nanisotropic Fermi fluid with a tunable density.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Sep 2013 11:10:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

It is, therefore,\nimportant to develop scalable processes for stabilizing them onto backed-up\nonline storage where they can be subject to highquality digital preservation\nmanagement. This goes hand in hand with the need to establish efficient,\nstandardized ways of recording metadata and to deal with defective\ndata-carriers.

Metabolic networks\nare often studied at steady state using constraint-based models and\noptimization techniques. However, metabolic adaptations driven by changes in\ngene expression cannot be analyzed by steady state models, as these do not\naccount for temporal changes in biomass composition. Here we present a dynamic\noptimization framework that integrates the metabolic network with the dynamics\nof biomass production and composition, explicitly taking into account enzyme\nproduction costs and enzymatic capacity. In contrast to the established dynamic\nflux balance analysis, our approach allows predicting dynamic changes in both\nthe metabolic fluxes and the biomass composition during metabolic adaptations.\nWe applied our algorithm in two case studies: a minimal nutrient uptake\nnetwork, and an abstraction of core metabolic processes in bacteria. In the\nminimal model, we show that the optimized uptake rates reproduce the empirical\nMonod growth for bacterial cultures. For the network of core metabolic\nprocesses, the dynamic optimization algorithm predicted commonly observed\nmetabolic adaptations, such as a diauxic switch with a preference ranking for\ndifferent nutrients, re-utilization of waste products after depletion of the\noriginal substrate, and metabolic adaptation to an impending nutrient\ndepletion. These examples illustrate how dynamic adaptations of enzyme\nexpression can be predicted solely from an optimization principle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Sep 2013 11:27:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 Oct 2014 06:23:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-24"}

It is also assumed in this model that natural selection operates\non phenotypes, rather than genotypes, of individuals, and that the relationship\nbetween phenotypes and genotypes is one-to-many. In the simulations based on\nthese assumptions, individuals exhibited phenotypic changes in response to an\nenvironmental change, corresponding multiple genetic mutations were\nincreasingly accumulated in individuals in the population, and phenotypic\nplasticity was gradually replaced with genetic mutations. This result suggests\nthat Lamarck's law of use and disuse can effectively hold without conflicting\nthe Weismann barrier, and thus evolution can be logically connected with\nontogenesis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Sep 2013 12:24:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-20"}

We\nexplore the effect of the synchrotron-self Compton cooling, which is inherently\ntime-dependent, leading to a rapid cooling of the electrons. Having discussed\nintensively the resulting effects of this cooling scenario on the spectral\nenergy distribution of blazars in previous papers, the effects of the\ntime-dependent approach on the synchrotron lightcurve are investigated here.\nTaking into account the retardation due to the finite size of the source and\nthe source geometry, we show that the time-dependent synchrotron-self Compton\n(SSC) cooling still has profound effects on the lightcurve compared to the\nusual linear (synchrotron and external Compton) cooling terms. This is most\nobvious if the SSC cooling takes longer than the light crossing time scale.\nThen in most frequency bands the variability time scale is up to an order of\nmagnitude shorter than under linear cooling conditions. This is yet another\nstrong indication that the time-dependent approach should be taken into account\nfor modeling blazar flares from compact emission regions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Sep 2013 12:56:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

Our goal is to identify the mixing time scale and the\nspatio-kinematics of such ejecta from the pc to kpc scale.\n  We use the SPI spectrometer on INTEGRAL and its observations along the\nGalactic ridge to trace the line shape of the 1808.63 keV gamma-ray line from\n26Al decay.

We find substantially\nhigher velocities than expected from Galactic rotation, the average bulk\nvelocity being ~200 km s^-1 larger than the Galactic-rotation prediction. The\nobserved radial velocity spread implies a Doppler-broadening of the gamma-ray\nline that is consistent with our measurements of the overall line width.

Using the Fisher information metric, we demonstrate\nthat weak value techniques can put all of the Fisher information about the\ndetected parameter into a small portion of the events and show how this fact\nalone gives technical advantages.

To improve the understanding of the radio emission, we\ntest theoretical descriptions with measured data. The observables used for\nthese tests are the absolute amplitude of the radio signal, and the shape of\nthe radio lateral distribution. We compare lateral distributions of more than\n500 LOPES events with two recent and public Monte Carlo simulation codes, REAS\n3.11 and CoREAS (v 1.0). The absolute radio amplitudes predicted by REAS 3.11\nare in good agreement with the LOPES measurements. The amplitudes predicted by\nCoREAS are lower by a factor of two, and marginally compatible with the LOPES\nmeasurements within the systematic scale uncertainties. In contrast to any\nprevious versions of REAS, REAS 3.11 and CoREAS now reproduce the shape of the\nmeasured lateral distributions correctly. This reflects a remarkable progress\ncompared to the situation a few years ago, and it seems that the main processes\nfor the radio emission of air showers are now understood: The emission is\nmainly due to the geomagnetic deflection of the electrons and positrons in the\nshower. Less important but not negligible is the Askaryan effect (net charge\nvariation). Moreover, we confirm that the refractive index of the air plays an\nimportant role, since it changes the coherence conditions for the emission:\nOnly the new simulations including the refractive index can reproduce rising\nlateral distributions which we observe in a few LOPES events.

This argument applies to any physical system that can act as a\nmemory, in the sense of preserving a record of the state of some other system.\nThis result follows from two principles: the robustness of the thermodynamic\narrow of time to small perturbations in the state, and the principle that a\nmemory should not have to be fine-tuned to match the state of the system being\nrecorded. This argument applies even if the memory system itself is completely\nreversible and non-dissipative. We make the argument with a paradigmatic\nsystem, then formulate it more broadly for any system that can be considered a\nmemory. We illustrate these principles for a few other example systems, and\ncompare our criteria to earlier treatments of this problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Sep 2013 23:29:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}
