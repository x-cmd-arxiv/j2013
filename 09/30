A central place fractal can\nbe treated as a monofractal with a single scaling process. However, in the real\nworld, a system of human settlements is a complex network with multi-scaling\nprocesses. The simple fractal central place models are not enough to interpret\nthe spatial patterns and evolutive processes of urban systems. It is necessary\nto construct multi-scaling fractal models of urban places. Based on the\npostulate of intermittent space filling, two typical multifractal models of\ncentral places are proposed in this paper. One model is put forward to reflect\nthe process of spatial convergence (aggregation), and the generalized\ncorrelation dimension varies from 0.7306 to 1.3181; the other model is\npresented to describe the process of spatial divergence (diffusion), the\ngeneralized correlation dimension ranges from 1.6523 to 1.7118. As a case\nstudy, an analogy is drawn between the theoretical models and a system of\ncities and towns of Central Plains, China. A finding is that urban systems take\non multifractal form, and can be modeled with multi-scaling fractals. This is a\npreliminary attempt to develop the theory of fractal central places, and the\nresults are helpful for understanding the similarities and differences between\nthe geographical process of spatial aggregation and that of spatial diffusion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Sep 2013 16:01:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-19"}

Firstly,\nthe simple standard deviation for the k-by-k window inside each of the\nmulti-focus images was computed. The contribution in this paper came from the\nidea that the focused part inside an image had high details rather than the\nunfocused part. Hence, the dispersion between pixels inside the focused part is\nhigher than the dispersion inside the unfocused part. Secondly, a simple\ncomparison between the standard deviation for each k-by-k window in the\nmulti-focus images could be computed. The highest standard deviation between\nall the computed standard deviations for the multi-focus images could be\ntreated as the optimal that is to be placed in the fused image.

However, conventional\noptimisation models lack detail on these aspects and have limited ability to\naddress the effectiveness of policy interventions because they do not represent\ndecision-making. As a result, known effects of technology lock-ins are liable\nto be underestimated. In contrast, our approach places investor decision-making\nat the core of the analysis and investigates how it drives the diffusion of\nlow-carbon technology in a highly disaggregated, hybrid, global\nmacroeconometric model, FTT:Power-E3MG. Ten scenarios to 2050 of the\nelectricity sector in 21 regions exploring combinations of electricity policy\ninstruments are analysed, including their climate impacts.

Assuming that,\non average, the distribution of Mg II gas follows that of dark matter up to a\ngas-to-mass ratio, we find the standard halo model to provide an accurate\ndescription of the gas distribution over three orders of magnitude in scale.\nWithin this framework we estimate the average host halo mass of luminous red\ngalaxies to be about 10^{13.5} M_solar, in agreement with other methods.

This quantity is in\nparticular crucial for solving the problem of uniformization of the\none-punctured torus. The computation of the accessory parameters for torus and\nsphere is an open longstanding problem which can however be solved if one\nsucceeds to derive an expression for the so-called classical Liouville action.\nThe method of calculation of the latter has been proposed some time ago by\nZamolodchikov brothers. Studying the semiclassical limit of the four-point\nfunction of the quantum Liouville theory on the sphere they have derived the\nclassical action for the Riemann sphere with four punctures. In the present\nwork Zamolodchikovs idea is exploited in the case of the Liouville field theory\non the torus.

Secondly, as an implication of the aforementioned correspondence it is\nobtained that the torus accessory parameter is related to the sum of all\nrescaled column lengths of the so-called \"critical\" Young diagrams extremizing\nthe instanton \"free energy\" for the N=2* gauge theory. Finally, it is pointed\nout that thanks to the known relation the sum over the \"critical\" column\nlengths can be expressed in terms of a contour integral in which the integrand\nis built out of certain special functions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Sep 2013 22:33:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 26 Oct 2013 11:12:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 2 Apr 2014 11:51:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-03"}

However, the development of experimental toy\nmodels that simulate gravitational lensing in curved spacetimes remains a\nchallenge, especially for visible light. Here, by utilizing a microstructured\noptical waveguide around a microsphere, we propose to mimic curved spacetimes\ncaused by gravity, with high precision.

The proposed microstructured waveguide can be used as an\nomnidirectional absorber, with potential light harvesting and microcavity\napplications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Sep 2013 02:18:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-01"}

Most literature on massive MIMO systems assumes\ntime division duplexing (TDD), although frequency division duplexing (FDD)\ndominates current cellular systems. Due to the large number of transmit\nantennas at the base station, currently standardized approaches would require a\nlarge percentage of the precious downlink and uplink resources in FDD massive\nMIMO be used for training signal transmissions and channel state information\n(CSI) feedback. To reduce the overhead of the downlink training phase, we\npropose practical open-loop and closed-loop training frameworks in this paper.\nWe assume the base station and the user share a common set of training signals\nin advance. In open-loop training, the base station transmits training signals\nin a round-robin manner, and the user successively estimates the current\nchannel using long-term channel statistics such as temporal and spatial\ncorrelations and previous channel estimates. In closed-loop training, the user\nfeeds back the best training signal to be sent in the future based on channel\nprediction and the previously received training signals. With a small amount of\nfeedback from the user to the base station, closed-loop training offers better\nperformance in the data communication phase, especially when the\nsignal-to-noise ratio is low, the number of transmit antennas is large, or\nprior channel estimates are not accurate at the beginning of the communication\nsetup, all of which would be mostly beneficial for massive MIMO systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Sep 2013 03:20:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 Mar 2014 02:15:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

We use the Bland-Jensen system\nto determine weak orientability for all matroids on at most nine elements and\nall matroids between ten and twelve elements having rank three.

A naive data locations management maintains pairs of data ID and\nnodes storing the data in tables. However, it is not practical when the number\nof pairs is too large. To solve this problem, management using data\ndistribution algorithms, rather than management using tables, has been proposed\nin recent research. It can distribute data by determining the node for storing\nthe data based on the datum ID. Such data distribution algorithms require the\nability to handle the addition or removal of nodes, short calculation time and\nuniform data distribution in the capacity of each node. This paper proposes a\ndata distribution algorithm called ASURA (Advanced Scalable and Uniform storage\nby Random number Algorithm) that satisfies these requirements. It achieves\nfollowing four characteristics: 1) minimum data movement to maintain data\ndistribution according to node capacity when nodes are added or removed, even\nif data are replicated, 2) roughly sub-micro-seconds calculation time, 3) much\nlower than 1% maximum variability between nodes in data distribution, and 4)\ndata distribution according to the capacity of each node.

For example, Raudenbush (2001) used depression as an\nexample to argue that it is incorrect to assume that all the people in a given\npopulation would be experiencing either increasing or decreasing levels of\ndepression. In such cases, traditional linear mixed effects model (assuming\ncommon parametric form for covariates and time) is not directly applicable for\nthe entire population as a group-averaged trajectory can mask important\nsubgroup differences.

The incident neutrons interacting with the converter\nlayer deposited on the sidewalls of the grooves have a higher capture\nprobability, owing to the larger effective absorption film thickness.

It amounts to estimating the parameters of a linear model that maps\ninput features to corresponding outputs. In the classical setting where the\nprecision of each data point is fixed, the famous Aitken/Gauss-Markov theorem\nin statistics states that generalized least squares (GLS) is a so-called \"Best\nLinear Unbiased Estimator\" (BLUE). In modern data science, however, one often\nfaces strategic data sources, namely, individuals who incur a cost for\nproviding high-precision data.\n  In this paper, we study a setting in which features are public but\nindividuals choose the precision of the outputs they reveal to an analyst. We\nassume that the analyst performs linear regression on this dataset, and\nindividuals benefit from the outcome of this estimation. We model this scenario\nas a game where individuals minimize a cost comprising two components: (a) an\n(agent-specific) disclosure cost for providing high-precision data; and (b) a\n(global) estimation cost representing the inaccuracy in the linear model\nestimate. In this game, the linear model estimate is a public good that\nbenefits all individuals. We establish that this game has a unique non-trivial\nNash equilibrium. We study the efficiency of this equilibrium and we prove\ntight bounds on the price of stability for a large class of disclosure and\nestimation costs. Finally, we study the estimator accuracy achieved at\nequilibrium. We show that, in general, Aitken's theorem does not hold under\nstrategic data sources, though it does hold if individuals have identical\ndisclosure costs (up to a multiplicative factor). When individuals have\nnon-identical costs, we derive a bound on the improvement of the equilibrium\nestimation cost that can be achieved by deviating from GLS, under mild\nassumptions on the disclosure cost functions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Sep 2013 12:48:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 4 Jul 2019 14:29:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 12 Dec 2019 23:47:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-16"}

We show that in luminous AGN, the radiation\npressure likely confines the ionized layer of the illuminated gas. Radiation\npressure confinement (RPC) has two main implications. First, the gas density\nnear the ionization front is 7x10^4 L_{i,45} r_{50}^{-2} cm^{-3}, where\nL_{i,45} is the ionizing luminosity in units of 10^45 erg/s and r_{50} is the\ndistance of the gas from the nucleus in units of 50 pc. Second, as shown by\nDopita et al., the solution of the ionization structure within each slab is\nunique, independent of the ambient pressure. We show that the RPC density vs.\ndistance relation is observed over a dynamical range of ~10^4 in distance, from\nsub-pc to kpc from the nucleus, and a range of ~10^8 in gas density, from 10^3\nto 10^11 cm^{-3}. This relation implies that the radiative force of luminous\nAGN can compress giant molecular clouds in the host galaxy, and possibly affect\nthe star formation rate. The unique ionization structure in RPC includes a\nhighly ionized X-ray emitting surface, an intermediate layer which emits\ncoronal lines, and a lower ionization inner layer which emits optical lines.\nThis structure can explain the observed overlap of the extended X-ray and\noptical narrow line emission in nearby AGN. We further support RPC by comparing\nthe predicted ratios of the narrow lines strength and narrow line widths with\navailable observations. We suggest a new method, based on the narrow line\nwidths, to estimate the black hole mass of low luminosity AGN.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Sep 2013 12:52:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-04"}

CeCoGe3 exhibits three magnetic phase transitions at T_N1 =\n21 K, T_N2 = 12 K and T_N3 = 8 K. The presence of long range magnetic order\nbelow T_N1 is revealed by the observation of oscillations of the asymmetry in\nthe muSR spectra between 13 K and 20 K and a sharp increase in the muon\ndepolarization rate. Single crystal neutron diffraction measurements reveal\nmagnetic Bragg peaks consistent with propagation vectors of k = 2/3 between\nT_N1 and T_N2, k = 5/8between T_N2 and T_N3 and k = 1/2 below T_N3. An increase\nin intensity of the (1 1 0) reflection between T_N1 and T_N3 also indicates a\nferromagnetic component in these phases. These measurements are consistent with\nan equal moment, two-up, two-down magnetic structure below T_N3, with a\nmagnetic moment of 0.405(5) mu_B/Ce. Above T_N2, the results are consistent\nwith an equal moment, two-up, one-down structure with a moment of 0.360(6)\nmu_B/Ce. INS studies reveal two crystal-field (CEF) excitations at 19 and 27\nmeV. From an analysis with a CEF model, the wave-functions of the J = 5/2\nmultiplet are evaluated along with a prediction for the magnitude and direction\nof the ground state magnetic moment. Our model correctly predicts that the\nmoments order along the c axis but the observed magnetic moment of 0.405(5)\nmu_B is reduced compared to the predicted moment of 1.01 mu_B. This is ascribed\nto hybridization between the localized Ce^3+ f-electrons and the conduction\nband. This suggests that CeCoGe3 has a degree of hybridization between that of\nCeRhGe3 and the non-centrosymmetric superconductor CeRhSi3.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Sep 2013 13:39:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-21"}

This is a generalisation of the probability\ndistribution for the ratio of single random variables, that is well-known, to\nthe multivariate case. This expression is derived within the context of the\nmeasurement of weak gravitational lensing from noisy galaxy images. We find\nthat the third flattening, or epsilon-ellipticity, has a biased maximum\nlikelihood but an unbiased mean; and that the third eccentricity, or normalised\npolarisation chi, has both a biased maximum likelihood and a biased mean. The\nvery fact that the bias in the ellipticity is itself a function of the\nellipticity requires an accurate knowledge of the intrinsic ellipticity\ndistribution of the galaxies in order to properly calibrate shear measurements.\nWe use this expression to explore strategies for calibration of biases caused\nby measurement processes in weak gravitational lensing. We find that upcoming\nweak lensing surveys like KiDS or DES require calibration fields of order of\nseveral square degrees and 1.2 magnitude deeper than the wide survey in order\nto correct for the noise bias. Future surveys like Euclid will require\ncalibration fields of order 40 square degree and several magnitude deeper than\nthe wide survey. We also investigate the use of the Stokes parameters to\nestimate the shear as an alternative to the ellipticity.

The interior-point solver we implement\n(IPsolve) is locally quadratically convergent, with $O(\\min(m,n)^2(m+n))$\narithmetic operations per iteration, where $n$ the number of unknown impulse\nresponse coefficients and $m$ the number of observed output measurements.\nIPsolve is competitive with available alternatives for system identification.\nThis is shown by a comparison with TFOCS, libSVM, and the FISTA algorithm. The\ncode is open source (https://github.com/saravkin/IPsolve).\n  The impact of the approach for system identification is illustrated with\nnumerical experiments featuring robust formulations for contaminated data,\nrelaxation systems, nonnegativity and unimodality constraints on the impulse\nresponse, and sparsity promoting regularization. Incorporating constraints\nyields particularly significant improvements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Sep 2013 14:30:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 5 Mar 2016 20:32:59 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 25 Mar 2016 15:35:29 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 25 Jul 2018 22:02:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-27"}

Furthermore, it is shown that these quantum cluster\nalgebras always equal the corresponding upper quantum cluster algebras.\nPrevious approaches to these problems for the construction of (quantum) cluster\nalgebra structures on (quantized) coordinate rings arising in Lie theory were\ndone on a case by case basis relying on the combinatorics of each concrete\nfamily.

All such applications also establish equality between the\nconstructed quantum cluster algebras and their upper counterparts. The proofs\nrely on Chatters' notion of noncommutative unique factorization domains. Toric\nframes are constructed by considering sequences of homogeneous prime elements\nof chains of noncommutative UFDs (a generalization of the construction of\nGelfand-Tsetlin subalgebras) and mutations are obtained by altering chains of\nnoncommutative UFDs. Along the way, an intricate (and unified) combinatorial\nmodel for the homogeneous prime elements in chains of noncommutative UFDs and\ntheir alterations is developed. When applied to special families, this recovers\nthe combinatorics of Weyl groups and double Weyl groups previously used in the\nconstruction and categorification of cluster algebras.

Specifically, the\ndensity attained at the cusp point in our experiment reached 65% of the peak\ndensity of the atoms in the trap prior to their release. We thereby add\ncaustics to the various phenomena with parallels in optics that can be\nharnessed for manipulation of cold atoms. The structural stability of\ncatastrophes provides inherent robustness against variations in the system's\ndynamics and initial conditions, making them suitable for manipulation of atoms\nunder imperfect conditions and limited controllability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Sep 2013 15:18:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-21"}

We find that the coincident structural and magnetic phase\ntransition to an orthorhombic (O) structure with space group Fmmm and a striped\nantiferromagnet (AF) with space group F(C)mm'm' in Ba1-xNaxFe2As2 is of first\norder.

The substantial size difference between Na and K\ncauses various changes in the lattice trends, yet the overarching property\nphase diagram from the Ba1-xKxFe2As2 phase diagram carries over to the\nBa1-xNaxFe2As2 solid solution.

In order to fully deal with the quantum nature of p-H2 molecules, we\nemploy the diffusion Monte Carlo method and realistic semi-empirical pairwise\npotentials describing the interactions between H2-H2 and Na-H2 species. In\nparticular, we calculate the energetic, structural and superfluid properties of\ntwo-dimensional Na-H2 systems within a narrow density interval around\nequilibrium at zero temperature. In contrast to previous computational studies\nconsidering other alkali metal species such as rubidium and potassium, we find\nthat the p-H2 ground-state is a liquid with a significantly large superfluid\nfraction of ~30%. The appearance of p-H2 superfluid response is due to the fact\nthat the interactions between Na atoms and H2 molecules are less attractive\nthan between H2 molecules. This induces a considerable reduction of the\nhydrogen density which favours the stabilization of the liquid phase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Sep 2013 15:56:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

The weakly enforced continuity of Crouzeix -\nRaviart function space across element edges leads to a natural boundary\ncondition for the multiscale basis functions which relaxes the sensitivity of\nour method to complex patterns of perforations.
