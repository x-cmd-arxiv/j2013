The\nquantitative description of the mass loss in these important pre-SN phases is\nhampered by unknowns such as clumping and porosity due to an in-homogeneous\nwind structure, and by an incomplete theoretical understanding of optically\nthick stellar winds. In this work we investigate the conditions in deep\natmospheric layers of WR stars to find out whether these comply with the theory\nof optically thick winds, and whether we find indications of clumping in these\nlayers. We use a new semi-empirical method to determine sonic-point optical\ndepths, densities, and temperatures for a large sample of WR stars of the\ncarbon (WC) and oxygen (WO) sequence. Based on an artificial model sequence we\ninvestigate the reliability of our method and its sensitivity to uncertainties\nin stellar parameters. We find that the WR stars in our sample obey an\napproximate relation with P_rad/P_gas~80 at the sonic point. This 'wind\ncondition' is ubiquitous for radiatively driven, optically thick winds, and\nsets constraints on possible wind/envelope solutions affecting radii, mass-loss\nrates, and clumping properties. Our results suggest that the presence of an\noptically thick wind may force many stars near the Eddington limit to develop\nclumped, radially extended sub-surface zones. The clumping in these zones is\nmost likely sustained by the non-linear strange-mode instability, and may be\nthe origin of the observed wind clumping. The properties of typical late-type\nWC stars comply with this model. Solutions without sub-surface clumping and\ninflation are also possible but demand for compact stars with comparatively low\nmass-loss rates. These objects may resemble the small group of WO stars with\ntheir exceptionally hot stellar temperatures and highly ionized winds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Sep 2013 16:11:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Oct 2013 16:30:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

B 70, 161101\n(2004)] has demonstrated the reduction of the O(N^3) cost of evaluating the\nSlater determinant with planewaves to O(N^2) using localized basis functions.\nWe compare four polynomial approximations as basis functions -- interpolating\nLagrange polynomials, interpolating piecewise-polynomial-form (pp-) splines,\nand basis-form (B-) splines (interpolating and smoothing). All these basis\nfunctions provide a similar speedup relative to the planewave basis. The\npp-splines have eight times the memory requirement of the other methods. To\ntest the accuracy of the basis functions, we apply them to the ground state\nstructures of Si, Al, and MgO. The polynomial approximations differ in accuracy\nmost strongly for MgO and smoothing B-splines most closely reproduce the\nplanewave value for of the variational Monte Carlo energy. Using separate\napproximations for the Laplacian of the orbitals increases the accuracy\nsufficiently to justify the increased memory requirement, making smoothing\nB-splines, with separate approximation for the Laplacian, the preferred choice\nfor approximating planewave-represented orbitals in QMC calculations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Sep 2013 16:57:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 Oct 2014 18:34:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-31"}

Yet despite examples of complicated frequency dynamics, the\npossibility of long-term evolutionary chaos is rarely considered. The concept\nof \"survival of the fittest\" is central to much evolutionary thinking and\nembodies a perspective of evolution as a directional optimization process\nexhibiting simple, predictable dynamics. This perspective is adequate for\nsimple scenarios, when frequency-independent selection acts on scalar\nphenotypes. However, in most organisms many phenotypic properties combine in\ncomplicated ways to determine ecological interactions, and hence\nfrequency-dependent selection. Therefore, it is natural to consider models for\nthe evolutionary dynamics generated by frequency-dependent selection acting\nsimultaneously on many different phenotypes. Here we show that complicated,\nchaotic dynamics of long-term evolutionary trajectories in phenotype space is\nvery common in a large class of such models when the dimension of phenotype\nspace is large, and when there are epistatic interactions between the\nphenotypic components. Our results suggest that the perspective of evolution as\na process with simple, predictable dynamics covers only a small fragment of\nlong-term evolution. Our analysis may also be the first systematic study of the\noccurrence of chaos in multidimensional and generally dissipative systems as a\nfunction of the dimensionality of phase space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Sep 2013 17:27:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-07"}

However, the initial\nconditions for these early stages are determined by the female during\noogenesis, and it is unknown whether reproducibility is passed on to the zygote\nor whether it is reacquired by the zygote. Here we examine the earliest\nreproducible pattern in the Drosophila embryo, the Bicoid protein gradient.\nUsing a unique combination of absolute molecule counting techniques, we show\nthat it is generated from a highly controlled source of mRNA molecules that is\nreproducible from embryo to embryo to within ~8%. This occurs in a perfectly\nlinear feed-forward process: changes in the female's gene dosage lead to\nproportional changes in the mRNA and protein counts in the embryo. In this\nsetup, noise is kept low in the transition from one molecular species to\nanother, allowing the female to precisely deposit the same absolute number of\nmRNA molecules in each embryo and therefore confer reproducibility to the\nBicoid pattern. Our results indicate that the reproducibility of the\nmorphological structures that emerge in the embryo originates during oogenesis\nwhen all initial patterning signals are controlled with precision similar to\nwhat we observe for the Bicoid pattern.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Sep 2013 18:03:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-25"}

A number of interesting new findings emerge from the present study.\nFor instance, we find that the Sigma3(112) twin boundary in BCC Fe possesses a\nmuch smaller binding energy than other boundaries, which corresponds in long\ntime dynamics simulations to the ability of an interstitial He defect to break\naway from the boundary in simulations on the order of nanoseconds, in contrast\nto other boundaries.

We\nconclude that the linear dependence on temperature is associated with the\nsusceptibility having a Curie or Curie-Weiss form while the\ntemperature-dependent relaxation mechanism has a microscopic rate proportional\nto the temperature. In La0.7Ca0.3MnO3, the Mn4+ susceptibility has the\nferromagnetic Curie-Weiss form, and the static contribution to the linewidth\narising from distortions of the oxygen octahedra is absent due to motional\nnarrowing brought on by the rapid hopping of the eg polarons. In YBaMn2O6\neither of two scenarios is possible. The Mn4+ susceptibility above 520 K is\nCurie-like and the static term is present, or the susceptibility has the\nantiferromagnetic Curie-Weiss form and the static term is absent due to\nmotional narrowing. It is concluded that the Curie model, with offsetting\ndouble exchange and and superexchange Curie-Weiss parameters, is the more\nlikely scenario. It is suggested that the linear-T variation of the linewidth\nin both materials arises from either a Korringa-like mechanism involving\ninteractions with mobile carriers or from a spin-phonon process coming from\ninteractions between the Mn4+ ions and the lattice vibrations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Sep 2013 21:22:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-26"}

In this article, we closely examine the two main\ngeneralizations of propensity score methods, namely, the propensity function\n(P-FUNCTION) of Imai and van Dyk (2004) and the generalized propensity score\n(GPS) of Hirano and Imbens (2004), along with recent extensions of the GPS that\naim to improve its robustness.

This crosstalk is accounted for by\nTrotter factorization, which is used to separate the all-atom from the\ncoarse-grained phases of the computation. In this approach, short molecular\ndynamics runs are used to advance in time the coarse-grained variables, which\nin turn guide the all-atom state. To achieve this coevolution, an all-atom\nmicrostate consistent with the updated coarse-grained variables must be\nrecovered. This recovery is cast here as a non-linear optimization problem that\nis solved with a quasi-Newton method. The approach yields a Boltzmann-relevant\nmicrostate whose coarse-grained representation and some of its fine-scale\nfeatures are preserved.

The BFOR framework provides the representation of mDWI in the\nq-space and thus reduces memory requirement.

A\nnew numerical method, which relies on the calculation of the two-time\ncorrelation and integrated response functions, is used to determine both the\ncritical temperature and the nonequilibrium scaling exponents, both for spin\nand chiral degrees of freedom. First, the ferromagnetic XY model is studied to\nvalidate this nonequilibirum aging method (NAM), since for this nondisordered\nsystem we can compare with known results obtained with standard equilibrium and\nnonequilibrium techniques. When applied to the case of the gauge-glass model,\nwe show that the NAM allows us to obtain precise and reliable values of its\ncritical quantities, improving previous estimates. The XY spin-glass model with\nboth Gaussian and bimodal bond distributions, is analyzed in more detail. The\nspin and the chiral two-time correlation and integrated response functions are\ncalculated in our simulations. The results obtained mainly for Gaussian and, to\na lesser extent, for bimodal interactions, support the existence of a\nspin-chiral decoupling scenario, where the chiral order occurs at a finite\ntemperature while the spin degrees of freedom order at very low or zero\ntemperature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Sep 2013 09:24:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Jan 2014 09:56:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-22"}

An increasing body of practical research on adoption of\npro-environmental behavior emphasizes the importance of encouragement from\nlocal social contacts and messaging about locally-embraced norms: we respond by\nextending the moral-motivation model to a social networks setting. We obtain a\nnew decision rule: an individual adopts a pro-environmental behavior if he or\nshe observes a certain threshold of adoption within their local social\nneighborhood. This gives rise to a concurrent update process which describes\nadoption of a pro-environmental behavior spreading through a network.

This extraordinarily bright event (the\nbrightest Geminid ever recorded by our team) was imaged from two meteor\nobserving stations operated by the SPanish Meteor Network (SPMN). The bolide\nexhibited fast and quasi-periodic variations in brightness, a behaviour\ntypically associated to the rotation of the parent meteoroid. The inferred\ntensile strength of this particle was found to be significantly higher that the\ntypical values obtained for Geminid meteoroids. The fireball penetrated in the\natmosphere till a final height of about 25 km above the ground level and a\nnon-zero terminal mass was calculated at the ending point of the luminous\ntrajectory.

This capacity-aware back-pressure control allows to improve\nperformance as congestion increases, as indicated by simulation results, and\nkeeps the key benefits of back-pressure: ability to be distributed over\nintersections and O(1) complexity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Sep 2013 12:38:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Oct 2013 11:30:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 22 Apr 2014 14:44:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-23"}

However, these methods have suffered from the following two\nlimitations. First, the time complexities of these methods are at least\nproportional to the cube of the data size, which make those methods inefficient\nfor solving large-scale problems. Second, they cannot cope with out-of-sample\ndata that are not used to construct the similarity graph.

In\nparticular, we want to determine above which gas density this variation arises\nand what changes in the grain optical properties/size distribution are\nrequired. We use the 3D radiative transfer code CRT, coupled to the dust\nemission and extinction code DustEM, to model the emission and extinction of\nthe dense filament. We test a range of optical properties and size\ndistributions for the grains: dust of the diffuse interstellar medium\n(interstellar PAHs and amorphous carbons and silicates) and both compact and\nfluffy aggregates. We find that the grain opacity has to increase across the\nfilament to fit simultaneously the near-IR extinction and Herschel emission\nprofiles of L1506. We interpret this change to be a consequence of the\ncoagulation of dust grains to form fluffy aggregates. Grains similar to those\nin the diffuse medium have to be present in the outer layers of the cloud,\nwhereas aggregates must prevail above gas densities of a few 1000 H/cm3. This\ncorresponds to line-of-sights with visual extinction in the V band of the order\nof 2 to 3. The dust opacity at 250 microns is raised by a factor of 1.8 to 2.2,\nwhile the grain average size is increased by a factor of 5.

Using a\nsimple approach, we show that the aggregates may have time to form inside the\nfilament within the cloud lifetime.

Establishing a robust evolutionary\nclassification scheme allows us not only to understand how the Sun was born but\nalso to predict what kind of main sequence star a given protostar will become.\nTraditionally, low-mass young stellar objects are classified according to the\nshape of their SEDs. Such methods are however prone to misclassification due to\ndegeneracy and do not constrain the temporal evolution. More recently, young\nstellar objects have been classified based on envelope, disk, and stellar\nmasses determined from resolved images of their continuum and line emission at\nsubmillimeter wavelengths. Through detailed modeling of two Class I sources, we\naim at determining accurate velocity profiles and explore the role of\nfreeze-out chemistry in such objects. We present new Submillimeter Array\nobservations of the continuum and HCO$^+$ line emission at 1.1 mm toward two\nprotostars, IRS 63 and IRS 43 in the Ophiuchus star forming region. The sources\nare modeled in detail using dust radiation transfer to fit the SED and\ncontinuum images and line radiation transfer to produce synthetic\nposition-velocity diagrams. We use a $\\chi^2$ search algorithm to find the best\nmodel fit to the data and to estimate the errors in the model variables. Our\nbest fit models present disk, envelope and stellar masses as well as the\nHCO$^+$ abundance and inclination of both sources. We also identify a ring\nstructure with a radius of about 200 AU in IRS 63. We find that freeze-out\nchemistry is important in IRS 63 but not for IRS 43. We show that the velocity\nfield in IRS 43 is consistent with Keplerian rotation. Due to molecular\ndepletion, it is not possible to draw a similar conclusion for IRS 63.

The peculiar shape and magnetic environment of the broad jet\nraised the question of whether it was created by the same physical processes of\npreviously studied jets with reconnection occurring high in the corona. We\ncarried out a multi-wavelength analysis using the EUV images from the\nAtmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) and magnetic fields from the Helioseismic\nand Magnetic Imager (HMI) both on-board the SDO satellite. The jet consisted of\nmany different threads that expanded in around 10 minutes to about 100 Mm in\nlength, with the bright features in later threads moving faster than in the\nearly ones, reaching a maximum speed of about 200 km s^{-1}. Time-slice\nanalysis revealed a striped pattern of dark and bright strands propagating\nalong the jet, along with apparent damped oscillations across the jet. This is\nsuggestive of a (un)twisting motion in the jet, possibly an Alfven wave. A\ntopological analysis of an extrapolated field was performed. Bald patches in\nfield lines, low-altitude flux ropes, diverging flow patterns, and a null point\nwere identified at the basis of the jet. Unlike classical lambda or\nEiffel-tower shaped jets that appear to be caused by reconnection in current\nsheets containing null points, reconnection in regions containing bald patches\nseems to be crucial in triggering the present jet. There is no observational\nevidence that the flux ropes detected in the topological analysis were actually\nbeing ejected themselves, as occurs in the violent phase of blowout jets;\ninstead, the jet itself may have gained the twist of the flux rope(s) through\nreconnection. This event may represent a class of jets different from the\nclassical quiescent or blowout jets, but to reach that conclusion, more\nobservational and theoretical work is necessary.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Sep 2013 14:18:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

We have recently found\nthat the power released by reconnection between the magnetic field lines of the\ncoronal inner disk region and the lines anchored into the black hole is able to\naccelerate relativistic particles through a first-order Fermi process and\nproduce the observed radio luminosity from both microquasars and low luminous\nAGNs (LLAGNs). We also found that the observed correlation between the radio\nluminosity and the mass of these sources, spanning 10^9 orders of magnitude in\nmass, is naturally explained by this process. In this work, assuming that the\ngamma-ray emission is probably originated in the same acceleration zones that\nproduce the radio emission, we have applied the scenario above to investigate\nthe origin of the high energy outcomes from an extensive number of sources\nincluding high (HLAGNs) and LLAGNs, microquasars and GRBs. We find correlation\nof our model with the gamma emission only for microquasars and a few LLAGNs,\nwhile none of the HLAGNs or GRBs are fitted, neither in radio nor in gamma. We\nattribute the lack of correlation of the gamma emission for most of the LLAGNs\nto the fact that this processed emission doesn't depend only on the local\nmagnetic field activity around the source/accretion disk, but also on other\nenvironmental factors like the photon and density fields. We conclude that the\nemission from the LLAGNs and microquasars comes from the nuclear region of\ntheir sources and therefore, can be driven by nuclear magnetic activity.\nHowever, in the case of the HLAGNs and GRBs, the nuclear emission is blocked by\nthe surrounding density and photon fields and therefore, we can only see the\njet emission further out.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Sep 2013 14:46:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-26"}

Its second goal is to evaluate the importance of\ninhomogeneities in the determination of dark energy parameters, whose real\nnature is still unknown and for which the influence of matter structures has\nbeen proposed as a cosmological alternative. We start with the definition of a\n\"geodesic lightcone\" gauge simplifying greatly the study of light propagation\nin the Universe. We then define a gauge invariant average of scalars on the\npast light cone and compute the effect of inhomogeneities on the luminosity\nflux by considering their power spectrum up to its non-linear regime. The\neffect on the flux is negligible whereas observables like the luminosity\ndistance, computed at second order in perturbations, are much more affected. We\nalso study the distance modulus at the basis of the discovery of dark energy\nfrom type Ia supernovae (SNe). The average of this modulus is only slightly\naffected by inhomogeneities but its variance sensitively depends on them. These\nresults show, within their hypotheses, that an alternative to dark energy by an\neffect of structures is impossible but, at the same time, emphasize their\nimportance on the dispersion of data in the Hubble diagram. The dominating\nphysical effects turn out to be peculiar velocity of SNe and weak lensing.

The radio object was detected both in our new VLA\nimage from observations in 2012 at 5.5 GHz and in archival VLA images from\nobservations in 1987 at 4.75 GHz and in the period from 1990 to 2002 at 8.31\nGHz. The radio morphology of this object is characterized as a compact,\npartially resolved point source located at the northern tip of a radio \"tongue\"\nsimilar to the X-ray structure observed by Chandra. Behind the Cannonball, a\nradio counterpart to the X-ray plume is observed. This object consists of a\nbroad radio plume with a size of 30\\arcsec$\\times$15\\arcsec, followed by a\nlinear tail having a length of 30\\arcsec. The compact head and broad plume\nsources appear to have relatively flat spectra ($\\propto\\nu^\\alpha$) with mean\nvalues of $\\alpha=-0.44\\pm0.08$ and $-0.10\\pm0.02$, respectively; and the\nlinear tail shows a steep spectrum with the mean value of $-1.94\\pm0.05$.
