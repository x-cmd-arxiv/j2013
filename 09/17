Solvers\nrelying on a boundary integral representation typically do not consider\nfeatures like solvent-filled cavities or ion-exclusion (Stern) layers, due to\nthe added difficulty of treating multiple boundary surfaces. This has hindered\nmeaningful comparisons with volume-based methods, and the effects on accuracy\nof including these features has remained unknown. This work presents a solver\ncalled PyGBe that uses a boundary-element formulation and can handle multiple\ninteracting surfaces. It was used to study the effects of solvent-filled\ncavities and Stern layers on the accuracy of calculating solvation energy and\nbinding energy of proteins, using the well-known APBS finite-difference code\nfor comparison. The results suggest that if required accuracy for an\napplication allows errors larger than about 2%, then the simpler,\nsingle-surface model can be used. When calculating binding energies, the need\nfor a multi-surface model is problem-dependent, becoming more critical when\nligand and receptor are of comparable size. Comparing with the APBS solver, the\nboundary-element solver is faster when the accuracy requirements are higher.\nThe cross-over point for the PyGBe code is in the order of 1-2% error, when\nrunning on one GPU card (NVIDIA Tesla C2075), compared with APBS running on six\nIntel Xeon CPU cores. PyGBe achieves algorithmic acceleration of the boundary\nelement method using a treecode, and hardware acceleration using GPUs via\nPyCuda from a user-visible code that is all Python.

This image-comparison technique\nhas been implemented and tested using our Astrobiology Phone-cam system, which\nemploys Bluetooth communication to send images to a local laptop server in the\nfield for the image-compression analysis. We tested the system in a field site\ndisplaying a heterogeneous suite of sandstones, limestones, mudstones and\ncoalbeds. Some of the rocks are partly covered with lichen. The image-matching\nprocedure of this system performed very well with data obtained through our\nfield test, grouping all images of yellow lichens together and grouping all\nimages of a coal bed together, and giving a 91% accuracy for similarity\ndetection. Such similarity detection could be employed to make maps of\ndifferent geological units. The novelty-detection performance of our system was\nalso rather good (a 64% accuracy). Such novelty detection may become valuable\nin searching for new geological units, which could be of astrobiological\ninterest. The image-comparison technique is an unsupervised technique that is\nnot capable of directly classifying an image as containing a particular\ngeological feature; labeling of such geological features is done post facto by\nhuman geologists associated with this study, for the purpose of analyzing the\nsystem's performance. By providing more advanced capabilities for similarity\ndetection and novelty detection, this image-compression technique could be\nuseful in giving more scientific autonomy to robotic planetary rovers, and in\nassisting human astronauts in their geological exploration and assessment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Sep 2013 16:32:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-08"}

We refer to this model as MIMO\nX-channel with asymmetric output feedback and delayed CSIT. The transmitters\nare equipped with M-antennas each, and the receivers are equipped with\nN-antennas each. For this model, accounting for both messages at each receiver,\nwe characterize the optimal sum secure degrees of freedom (SDoF) region. We\nshow that, in presence of asymmetric output feedback and delayed CSIT, the sum\nSDoF region of the MIMO X-channel is same as the SDoF region of a two-user MIMO\nBC with 2M-antennas at the transmitter, N-antennas at each receiver and delayed\nCSIT. This result shows that, upon availability of asymmetric output feedback\nand delayed CSIT, there is no performance loss in terms of sum SDoF due to the\ndistributed nature of the transmitters. Next, we show that this result also\nholds if only output feedback is conveyed to the transmitters, but in a\nsymmetric manner, i.e., each receiver feeds back its output to both\ntransmitters and no CSIT. We also study the case in which only asymmetric\noutput feedback is provided to the transmitters, i.e., without CSIT, and derive\na lower bound on the sum SDoF for this model.

Likewise, with representations of dog, house, and kennel, an\nalgorithm should be able to recognize that the semantic composition of dog and\nhouse, dog house, is highly similar to kennel (dog house and kennel are\nsynonymous). It seems that these two tasks, recognizing relations and\ncompositions, are closely connected. However, up to now, the best models for\nrelations are significantly different from the best models for compositions. In\nthis paper, we introduce a dual-space model that unifies these two tasks. This\nmodel matches the performance of the best previous models for relations and\ncompositions. The dual-space model consists of a space for measuring domain\nsimilarity and a space for measuring function similarity. Carpenter and wood\nshare the same domain, the domain of carpentry. Mason and stone share the same\ndomain, the domain of masonry. Carpenter and mason share the same function, the\nfunction of artisans. Wood and stone share the same function, the function of\nmaterials. In the composition dog house, kennel has some domain overlap with\nboth dog and house (the domains of pets and buildings). The function of kennel\nis similar to the function of house (the function of shelters).

It is also\nshown that the % of non-Hermitian gates increases with the dimension. For\nexample, 58.33% of the 2-bit gates, 98.10% of the 3-bit gates and 99.99% of the\n4-bit gates are non-Hermitian. As classical reversible gates are essentially\npermutation gates, above statistics is strictly valid for classical reversible\ngates, but the argument can be easily extended to include quantum gates and to\nestablish that the majority of the quantum gates are also non-self-inverse.\nFurther, the % of genuinely 2-bit reversible gates (i.e., 2-bit gates that\ncannot be decomposed as a product of two single bit gates) among all possible\ngates has been computed as 83.3%, and the applicability of this analysis in the\noptimization of circuit cost is discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Sep 2013 17:01:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Feb 2017 13:36:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-21"}

However, as established\nin the very early work of Edwin Hall, ferromagnetic conductors such as Fe, Co,\nand Ni have an anomalous Hall conductivity contribution that cannot be\nattributed to Lorentz forces and therefore survives in the absence of a\nmagnetic field. Although the anomalous Hall effect is experimentally strong, it\nhas stood alone among metallic transport effects for much of the last century\nbecause it lacked a usefully predictive, generally accepted theory. Progress\nover the past decade has explained why. It is now clear that the anomalous Hall\neffect in ferromagnets has contributions from both extrinsic scattering\nmechanisms similar to those that determine most transport coefficients, and\nfrom an intrinsic mechanism that is independent of scattering. The anomalous\nHall effect is also observed in paramagnets, which have nonzero magnetization\ninduced by an external magnetic field. Although no explicit relationship has\nbeen established, the anomalous Hall effect in a particular material is usually\nassumed to be proportional to its magnetization. In this work we point out that\nit is possible to have an anomalous Hall effect in a noncollinear\nantiferromagnet with zero net magnetization provided that certain common\nsymmetries are absent, and predict that Mn3Ir, a technologically important\nantiferromagnetic material with noncollinear order that survives to very high\ntemperatures, has a surprisingly large anomalous Hall effect comparable in size\nto those of the elemental transition metal ferromagnets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Sep 2013 17:09:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-14"}

In the\npedestal the ExB drift in the radial electric field can give a larger\ncontribution to the poloidal motion of impurities than that of their parallel\nstreaming. Under such circumstances we find that up-down asymmetries can also\naffect impurity peaking.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Sep 2013 18:23:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Nov 2013 19:26:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-28"}

Negative spatial curvature is one possibility, but the\nwindow for its detection is now small. However, another possible signal is a\nsuppression of the CMB power spectrum at large angles. This arises from the\nsteepening of the effective potential as it interpolates between a flat\ninflationary plateau and the high barrier separating us from our parent vacuum.\nWe demonstrate that these two effects can be parametrically separated in\nangular scale.\n  Observationally, the steepening effect appears to be excluded at large l; but\nit remains consistent with the slight lack of power below l about 30 found by\nthe WMAP and Planck collaborations. We give two simple models which improve the\nfit to the Planck data; one with observable curvature and one without. Despite\ncosmic variance, we argue that future CMB polarization and most importantly\nlarge-scale structure observations should be able to corroborate the Planck\nanomaly if it is real.\n  If we further assume the specific theoretical setting of a landscape of\nmetastable vacua, as suggested by string theory, we can estimate the\nprobability of seeing a low-l suppression in the CMB.

A drawback of this method\nis that the resulting quantized theory does not have manifest Lorentz\ninvariance. This motivated the quest of alternatives to the usual Hamiltonian\ntheory on the space of sections; a particular instance of this search is the so\ncalled restricted Hamiltonian theory, where the equations of motion of a field\ntheory are formulated by means of a multisymplectic structure, a kind of\ngeneralization of the symplectic form to the multidimensional context, and even\na constraint algorithm working in this context has been proposed. In the\npresent article we will try to provide partial aswers to two questions\nintimately related with these issues: First, to assign multisymplectic spaces\nto variational problems in the Griffiths formalism in such a way that the\nequations of motion can be written as restricted Hamiltonian systems, and\nsecond, to propose a covariant Dirac-like algorithm suitable to work with them;\nit must be recalled that given the Griffiths formalism contains the classical\nvariational problems as particular instances, it yields to a novel covariant\nalgorithm for deal with constraints in field theory.

We measured the time-integrated\nand time-resolved spectra and the second-order correlation function of the\nphotoluminescence from quantum dots with diameters ranging from 19 nm to 33 nm\nat temperatures of 10 K to 120 K. The influence of the small fluctuations in\nstructural parameters, most importantly the quantum dot thickness, on the\noptical properties are also investigated through statistical correlations among\nmultiple optical properties of many individual quantum dots. We found that in a\nsingle dot the strain-induced polarization field and the strain relaxation at\nthe sidewall form a potential barrier to protect the exciton from reaching the\nsidewall surface. However, the exciton can overcome this potential barrier and\nrecombine nonradiatively at the surface through two mechanisms: tunnelling\nthrough the barrier quantum mechanically and hopping over the barrier by\nattaining sufficient thermal energy. The former (latter) mechanism is\ntemperature insensitive (sensitive) and dominates nonradiaitve exciton decay at\nlow (high) temperatures. We also found that despite the good uniformities in\nstructural parameters, all optical properties still exhibit inhomogeneities\nfrom dot to dot. However, all these inhomogeneities can be modeled by simply\nvarying the potential barrier height, which also explains the observed\ncorrelation curves among all optical properties. Finally, we found that the\nbiexciton-to-exciton quantum efficiency ratio, which determines the probability\nof multi-photon emission, can be tuned by adjusting the potential barrier\nheight and the temperature, suggesting a new way to achieve single photon\nemission at high temperatures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Sep 2013 19:49:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 May 2014 05:00:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-07"}

The common explanation\nfor these events involves a weak explosion, producing a radioactive outflow\nwith small ejected mass and kinetic energy (M ~ 0.1 Msun and E ~ 0.1 B,\nrespectively), perhaps from the detonation of a helium shell on a white dwarf.\nWe argue, in contrast, that these events may be Type Ib/c SNe with typical\nmasses and energies (M ~ 3 Msun, E ~ 1 B), but which ejected very little\nradioactive material. In our picture, the light curve is powered by the\ndiffusion of thermal energy deposited by the explosion shock wave, and the\nrapid evolution is due to recombination, which reduces the opacity and results\nin an \"oxygen-plateau\" light curve.

As\nfeedback from the first generation of stars altered the contents of the\ninterstellar medium, the universe switched to a low-mass mode of star\nformation, which continues in the high metallicity stars formed in the present\nera. Several studies have investigated the transition between metal-free and\nmetal-enriched star formation, with tentative evidence being found for a\nmetallicity threshold near 10^-3.5 Z_sun due to atomic and molecular\ntransitions and another threshold near 10^-5.5 Z_sun due to dust. In this work,\nwe simulate the formation of stars in idealized low-metallicity halos using the\nAMR code Enzo. We conduct several simulations of 10^6 M_sun and 10^7 M_sun\nhalos in which the metal content, initial rotation, and degree of turbulence\nare varied in order to study the effect of these properties on gas\nfragmentation over a range of densities. We find tentative support for the idea\nof a critical metallicity, but the effect of varying metallicity on the gas we\nobserve is not as dramatic as what has been reported in earlier studies. We\nfind no clear relation between the initial spin or the initial level of\nturbulence in the halo and the final properties of the gas contained therein.\nAdditionally, we find that the degree to which the Jeans length is refined, the\ninitial density profile of the gas, and the inclusion of deuterium chemistry\neach have a significant effect on the evolution and fragmentation of the gas in\nthe halo - in particular, we find that at least 64 grid cells are needed to\ncover the Jeans length in order to properly resolve the fragmentation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Sep 2013 20:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-24"}

As a result, it is found that the\ncluster abundance in these simulations is around 15 per cent lower than the\ncommonly-adopted fit to dark matter simulations by Tinker et al (2008) for the\nmass range $10^{14}-10^{14.5}h^{-1} \\mathrm{M}_\\odot$.

We characterize these states through\nstudying topological degeneracies, the overlap between the ground states of\ntwo-body interactions and the exact RR ground states of three- and four-body\ninteractions, and state counting in the particle-cut entanglement spectrum.\nMoreover, we demonstrate how an approximate lattice form of Haldane's\npseudopotentials, analogous to that in the continuum, can be used as an\nefficient guiding principle in the search for lattice models with stable\nnon-Abelian phases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Sep 2013 20:17:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 2 Nov 2013 07:30:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-05"}

It covers the entire\nGMC at different scales and angular resolutions. In this paper we present: 1)\nan all-configuration SMA mosaic in the 230-GHz band covering the central 3\narcmin (10 pc, known as W49N), with most of the embedded massive stars; and 2)\nPMO 14m telescope observations in the 90-GHz band, covering the entire GMC with\nmaps up to 35 arcmin in size, or 113 pc. We also make use of archival data from\nthe VLA, JCMT-SCUBA, IRAM 30m, and the CSO BOLOCAM GPS. Our main findings are:\n1) The W49 GMC is one of the most massive in the Galaxy, with a total mass\n~1.1x10^6 Msun within a radius of 60 pc. Within a radius of 6 pc, the total gas\nmass is ~2x10^5 Msun. At these scales only 1% of the material is photoionized.\nThe mass reservoir is sufficient to form several young massive clusters (YMCs)\nas massive as a globular cluster. 2) The mass of the GMC is distributed in a\nhierarchical network of filaments. At scales <10 pc, a triple, centrally\ncondensed structure peaks toward the ring of HC HII regions in W49N. This\nstructure extends to scales from ~10 to 100 pc. The W49A starburst most likely\nformed from global gravitational contraction with localized collapse in a\n\"hub-filament\" geometry. 3) Currently, feedback from the central YMCs (with a\npresent mass Mcl > 5x10^4 Msun) is still not enough to entirely disrupt the\nGMC, but further stellar mass growth could be enough to allow radiation\npressure to clear the cloud and halt star formation. 4) The resulting stellar\ncontent will probably remain as a gravitationally bound massive star cluster,\nor a small system of bound clusters.

In this formalism the six components\nof the reduced source function are angle-independent quantities. It thus\nreduces drastically the storage requirement of numerical codes. This approach\nencounters a fundamental problem when the medium is illuminated by a polarized\nincident radiation, because there is a priori no way of relating the known (and\nmeasurable) Stokes parameters of the incident radiation to boundary conditions\nfor the reduced equations. The origin of this problem is that there is no\nunique way of deriving the radiation reduced components from its Stokes\nparameters (only the inverse operation is clearly defined). The method proposed\nhere aims at enabling to work with arbitrary incident radiation field\n(polarized or unpolarized). In previous works an ad-hoc treatment of the\nboundary conditions, applying to cases where the incident radiation is\nunpolarized, has been used. In this note we show that it is possible to account\nfor the incident radiation in a rigorous way, without any assumption on its\nproperties, by expressing the radiation field as the sum of a directly\ntransmitted radiation and of a so-called diffuse radiation. The diffuse\nradiation field obeys a transfer equation with no incident radiation that may\nbe solved in the reduced form. The first scattering of the incident radiation\nintroduces primary creation terms in the six components of the reduced source\nfunction. Once the reduced polarized transfer problem is solved for the diffuse\nradiation field, its Stokes parameters can be computed. We perform numerical\ncomputations of such cases, showing that the emergent line-polarization may be\nsignificantly affected by the polarization of the incident radiation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Sep 2013 02:43:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

In particular, the number of endogenous regressors in the main\nequation and the instruments in the first-stage equations can grow with and\nexceed the sample size n. The analysis concerns the exact sparsity case, i.e.,\nthe maximum number of non-zero components in the vectors of parameters in the\nfirst-stage equations, k1, and the number of non-zero components in the vector\nof parameters in the second-stage equation, k2, are allowed to grow with n but\nslowly compared to n. I consider the high-dimensional version of the two-stage\nleast square estimator where one obtains the fitted regressors from the\nfirst-stage regression by a least square estimator with l_1-regularization (the\nLasso or Dantzig selector) when the first-stage regression concerns a large\nnumber of instruments relative to n, and then construct a similar estimator\nusing these fitted regressors in the second-stage regression. The main\ntheoretical results of this paper are non-asymptotic bounds from which I\nestablish sufficient scaling conditions on the sample size for estimation\nconsistency in l_2-norm and variable-selection consistency. A technical issue\nregarding the so-called \"restricted eigenvalue (RE) condition\" for estimation\nconsistency and the \"mutual incoherence (MI) condition\" for selection\nconsistency arises in the two-stage estimation from allowing the number of\nregressors in the main equation to exceed n and this paper provides analysis to\nverify these RE and MI conditions. Depending on the underlying assumptions, the\nupper bounds on the l_2-error and the sample size required to obtain these\nconsistency results differ by factors involving k1 and/or k2. Simulations are\nconducted to gain insight on the finite sample performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Sep 2013 06:13:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-18"}

The parameters extracted included the temperature at which 50% of\nthe aerosol had evaporated (TVFR0.5) and the slope factor (SVFR). An increase\nin SVFR indicates a broader distribution of vapor pressures for the aerosol\nconstituents. Reducing the reaction temperature increased SVFR and decreased\nTVFR0.5 under humid conditions but had less effect on TVFR0.5 under dry\nconditions. In general, higher water concentrations gave lower TVFR0.5 values,\nmore negative SVFR values, and a reduction in total SOA production. The radical\nconditions were changed by introducing OH scavengers to generate systems with\nand without OH radicals and with different [HO2]/[RO2] ratios. Presence of a\nscavenger and lower [HO2]/[RO2] ratio reduced SOA production. Observed changes\nin SVFR values could be linked to the more complex chemistry that occurs in the\nabsence of a scavenger, and indicated that additional HO2 chemistry gives\nproducts with a wider range of vapor pressures. Updates to existing ozonolysis\nmechanisms with routes that describe the observed responses to water and\nradical conditions for monoterpenes with endocyclic and exocyclic double bonds\nare discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Sep 2013 07:04:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-28"}

In the\nsecond, we minimize the total transmit power satisfying the\nsignal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio constraints of the subcarriers per\ncell. Both problems are solved using standard conic optimization packages. A\nless complex, fast, and provably convergent algorithm that maximizes the\nweighted sum-rate with per-cell transmit power constraints is formulated. We\napproximate the nonconvex weighted sum- rate maximization (WSRM) problem with a\nsolvable convex form by means of a sequential parametric convex approximation\napproach. The second- order cone formulations of an objective function and the\nconstraints of the optimization problem are derived through a proper change of\nvariables, first-order linear approximation, and hyperbolic constraints\ntransformation. This algorithm converges to the suboptimal solution while\ntaking fewer it- erations in comparison to other known iterative WSRM\nalgorithms.

We use an\nadaptive kernel density estimate to quantify the significance, including a\ncomparison with other fields. The overdensity has a size of ~3.5-4' and stands\nout at ~5sigma with respect to the background estimate. No features with\nsimilar significance were found in four extragalactic control fields:\nGOODS-North, Lockman, COSMOS and UDS. The chance of having a similar\noverdensity in a field with the same number but randomly distributed sources is\nless than 2%. The clump is also visible as a low surface brightness feature in\nthe Planck 857 GHz map. We detect 76 sources at 250 micron (with a\nsignal-to-noise ratio greater than 3), in a region of 4' radius; 43 of those\nare above a flux density limit of 20 mJy. This is a factor of 3.6 in excess\nover the average in the four control fields, considering only the sources above\n20 mJy. We also find an excess in the number counts of sources with 250 micron\nflux densities between 30 and 40 mJy, compared to deep extragalactic\nblank-field number counts. Assuming a fixed dust temperature (30 K) and\nemissivity (beta=1.5) a crude, blackbody-derived redshift distribution, zBB, of\nthe detected sources is significantly different from the distributions in the\ncontrol fields and exhibits a significant peak at zBB ~ 1.5, although the\nactual peak redshift is highly degenerate with the temperature. We tentatively\nsuggest, based on zBB and the similar S250/S350 colours of the sources within\nthe peak, that a significant fraction of the sources in the clump may be at a\nsimilar redshift. Since the overdensity lies ~7' south of the z=2.16 Spiderweb\nprotocluster MRC1138-26, an intriguing possibility (that is presently\nunverifiable given the data in hand) is that it lies within the same\nlarge-scale structure.(abridged)\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Sep 2013 08:24:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-03"}

This is particularly challenging since all QED\ntextbooks state that such an splitting cannot be done for a photon (and a\nfortiori for a gluon) in a gauge-invariant way, yet experimentalists around the\nworld are engaged in measuring what they believe is the gluon spin! This\nquestion has been a subject of intense debate and controversy, ever since, in\n2008, it was claimed that such a gauge-invariant split was, in fact, possible.\nWe explain in what sense this claim is true and how it turns out that one of\nthe main problems is that such a decomposition is not unique and therefore\nraises the question of what is the most natural or physical choice. The\nessential requirement of measurability does not solve the ambiguities and leads\nus to the conclusion that the choice of a particular decomposition is\nessentially a matter of taste and convenience. In this review, we provide a\npedagogical introduction to the question of angular momentum decomposition in a\ngauge theory, present the main relevant decompositions and discuss in detail\nseveral aspects of the controversies regarding the question of gauge\ninvariance, frame dependence, uniqueness and measurability. We stress the\nphysical implications of the recent developments and collect into a separate\nsection all the sum rules and relations which we think experimentally relevant.\nWe hope that such a review will make the matter amenable to a broader community\nand will help to clarify the present situation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Sep 2013 09:10:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-01"}

The number of ejected particles and their velocities can be\ncontrolled by two parameters, the threshold of the potential and the\ninterparticle interaction. Since these parameters are fully under experimental\ncontrol, this is also the case for the number of ejected particles and their\nemission spectrum. The process of tunneling to open space can hence be used,\nfor example, for the quantum simulation of complicated tunneling ionization\nprocesses and atom lasers. To understand the many-body tunneling process, a\ngeneralization of the model introduced in [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 109,\n13521 (2012)] for tunneling in the absence of a threshold is put forward and\nproven to apply for systems with a non-zero threshold value. It is demonstrated\nthat the model is applicable for general interparticle interaction strengths,\nparticle numbers and threshold values. The model constructs the many-body\nprocess from single-particle emission processes. The rates and emission momenta\nof the single-particle processes are determined by the chemical potentials and\nenergy differences to the threshold value of the potential for systems with\ndifferent particle numbers. The chemical potentials and these energy\ndifferences depend on the interparticle interaction. Both the number of\nconfined particles and their rate of emission thus allow for a control by the\nmanipulation of the interparticle interaction and the threshold. Numerically\nexact results for two, three and one hundred bosons are shown and discussed.\nThe devised control scheme for the many-body tunneling process performs very\nwell for the dynamics of the momentum density, the correlations, the coherence\nand of the final state, i.e., the number of particles that remain confined in\nthe potential.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Sep 2013 10:37:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-21"}

Vitelli et al., Nature Photon. 7, 521 (2013)]\nthat corresponds to the transfer of the internal two-dimensional quantum states\nof two input photons, i.e., two photonic qubits, into the four-dimensional\nquantum state of a single photon, i.e., a photonic ququart. A scheme for the\ninverse process, namely \"quantum state splitting\", has also been theoretically\nproposed. Both processes can be iterated in a cascaded layout, to obtain the\njoining and/or splitting of more than two qubits, thus leading to a general\nscheme for varying the number of photons in the system while preserving its\ntotal quantum state, or quantum information content. Here, we revisit these\nprocesses from a theoretical point of view. After casting the theory of the\njoining and splitting processes in the more general photon occupation number\nnotation, we introduce some modified schemes that are in principle unitary (not\nconsidering the implementation of the CNOT gates) and do not require projection\nand feed-forward steps. This can be particularly important in the quantum state\nsplitting case, to obtain a scheme that does not rely on postselection.\nMoreover, we formally prove that the quantum joining of two photon states with\nlinear optics requires the use of at least one ancilla photon. This is somewhat\nunexpected, given that the demonstrated joining scheme involves the sequential\napplication of two CNOT quantum gates, for which a linear optical scheme with\njust two photons and postselection is known to exist. Finally we explore the\nrelationship between the joining scheme and the generation of clusters of\nmulti-particle entangled states involving more than one qubit per particle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Sep 2013 10:44:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

The method is completely automated and does not require\nprior knowledge of the stellar parameters.

The main step in extracting interstellar lines is a\nconstruction of the stellar spectrum, which is in our method done by finding\nother observed spectra that lack interstellar features and are otherwise very\nsimilar to the spectrum in question.

We calibrate and extensively test our method using a suite of cosmological\nsimulations of the formation of Milky Way-sized galaxies. Our best estimate of\nthe local Galactic escape speed, which we define as the minimum speed required\nto reach three virial radii $R_{340}$, is $533^{+54}_{-41}$ km/s (90%\nconfidence) with an additional 5% systematic uncertainty, where $R_{340}$ is\nthe Galactocentric radius encompassing a mean over-density of 340 times the\ncritical density for closure in the Universe. From the escape speed we further\nderive estimates of the mass of the Galaxy using a simple mass model with two\noptions for the mass profile of the dark matter halo: an unaltered and an\nadiabatically contracted Navarro, Frenk & White (NFW) sphere. If we fix the\nlocal circular velocity the latter profile yields a significantly higher mass\nthan the un-contracted halo, but if we instead use the statistics on halo\nconcentration parameters in large cosmological simulations as a constraint we\nfind very similar masses for both models.

Our\ngeneralization uses the fact that there is a representation of this group\nacting on the fermionic Fock space which when restricted to fixed particle\nnumber subspaces recovers naturally the usual SLOCC transformations. The new\ningredient is the occurrence of Bogoliubov transformations of the whole Fock\nspace changing the particle number. The classification scheme built on the Spin\ngroup prohibits naturally entanglement between states containing even and odd\nnumber of fermions. In our scheme the problem of classification of entanglement\ntypes boils down to the classification of spinors where totally separable\nstates are represented by so called pure spinors. We construct the basic\ninvariants of the Spin group and show how some of the known SLOCC invariants\nare just their special cases. As an example we present the classification of\nfermionic systems with a Fock space based on six single particle states. An\nintriguing duality between two different possibilities for embedding\nthree-qubit systems inside the fermionic ones is revealed.

The system shows the signature of a K-type, rapidly\nrotating giant, and most likely constitutes an accretion-induced post-mass\ntransfer system similar to other PNe such as LoTr 5, WeBo 1 and A70. Such\nsystems represent rare opportunities to further the investigation into the\nformation of barium stars and intermediate period post-AGB systems -- a\nformation process still far from being understood. Here, we present the first\ndetailed analyses of both the central star system and the surrounding nebula of\nLoTr 1 using a combination of spectra obtained with VLT-FORS2, AAT-UCLES and\nNTT-EMMI, as well as SuperWASP photometry. We confirm the binary nature of the\ncentral star of LoTr 1 that consists of a K1 III giant and a hot white dwarf.\nThe cool giant does not present any sign of s-process enhancement but is shown\nto have a rotation period of 6.4 days, which is a possible sign of mass\naccretion. LoTr 1 also presents broad double-peaked H-alpha emission lines,\nwhose origin is still unclear. The nebula of LoTr 1 consists in two slightly\nelongated shells, with ages of 17,000 and 35,000 years, respectively, and with\ndifferent orientations. As such, LoTr 1 present a very different nebular\nmorphology than A70 and WeBo 1, which may be an indication of difference in the\nmass transfer episodes\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Sep 2013 13:48:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

Methods.We\nextracted additional RVs and $[M/H]$ from the RAdial Velocity Experiment (RAVE)\nvia a cross-match with the Catalogue of Stars in Open Cluster Areas (CSOCA).\nFor the identified OCs in RAVE we derived RV and $[M/H]$ from a cleaned working\nsample and compared the results with previous findings. Results. Although our\nRAVE sample does not show the same accuracy as the entire survey, we were able\nto derive reliable RV for 110 Galactic open clusters. For 37 OCs we publish RV\nfor the first time. Moreover, we determined $[M/H]$ for 81 open clusters,\nextending the number of OCs with $[M/H]$ by 69.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Sep 2013 14:34:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

Nondeterministic noiseless\nlinear amplifiers are therefore realizable. Usually nondeterministic amplifiers\nrely on using single photon sources. We have, in contrast, recently proposed an\namplification scheme in which no external energy is added to the signal, but\nthe energy required to amplify the signal originates from the stochastic\nfluctuations in the field itself. Applying our amplification scheme, we examine\nthe amplifier gain and the success rate as well as the properties of the output\nstates after successful and failed amplification processes. We also optimize\nthe setup to find the maximum success rates in terms of the reflectivities of\nthe beam splitters used in the setup.

Newton's\ngravitational potential satisfies the Poisson equation. We relate the potential\nto a component of the metric tensor by equating the nonrelativistic result of\nthe principle of stationary proper time to the Lagrangian for a classical\ngravitational field. In the Poisson equation the Laplacian of the component of\nthe metric tensor is generalized to a cyclic linear combination of the second\nderivatives of the metric tensor. In local coordinates it is a single component\nof the Ricci tensor. This component of the Ricci tensor is proportional to the\nmass density that is related to a single component of the energy-momentum\nstress tensor and its trace. We thus obtain a single component of Einstein's\ngravitational field equation in local coordinates. From the principle of\ngeneral covariance applied to a single component, we obtain all tensor\ncomponents of Einstein's gravitational field equation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Sep 2013 02:48:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-20"}

A new\n\"mechanical\" mass density is created to be used in computing inertial\nquantities, whereas the actual mass density is treated as a thermodynamic\nvariable. A new set of balance laws is proposed, including a mass balance\nequation with a non-convective flux. The basic principles of irreversible\nthermodynamics are used to obtain linear constitutive equations that are\nexpansions of--not only the usual affinities involving gradients of temperature\nand velocity--but also the gradient of the chemical potential. Transport\ncoefficients are then chosen based on an elementary diffusion model, which\nyields simple constitutive laws featuring just two transport parameters: one\nfor the longitudinal part of the motion and one for the rotational part. The\nresulting formulation differs from the Navier-Stokes-Fourier equations of fluid\nmotion.

The radical pair\nmechanism, in which very weak magnetic fields can influence certain types of\nspin-dependent chemical reactions, leading to biologically observable signals,\nhas recently imposed itself as one of the most promising candidates for certain\nspecies. This is thanks both to its extreme sensitivity and its capacity to\nreproduce results from behavioral studies. Still, in order to gain a\ndirectional sensitivity, an anisotropic mechanism is needed. Recent proposals\nhave explored the possibility that such an anisotropy is due to the\nelectron-nucleus hyperfine interaction. In this work we explore a different\npossibility, in which the anisotropy is due to spin-orbit coupling between the\nelectron spin and its angular momentum. We will show how a\nspin-orbit-coupling-based magnetic compass can have performances comparable\nwith the usually-studied nuclear-hyperfine based mechanism.
