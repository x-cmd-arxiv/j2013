In the copper-oxide high temperature superconductors\n(HTSCs), a strongly anisotropic energy gap, which vanishes along high symmetry\ndirections, is a clear manifestation of the d-wave symmetry of the pairing.\nThere is, however, a dramatic change in the form of the gap anisotropy with\nreduced carrier concentration (underdoping). Although the vanishing of the gap\nalong the diagonal to the square Cu-O bond directions is robust, the doping\ndependence of the large gap along the Cu-O directions suggests that its origin\nmight be different from pairing. It is thus tempting to associate the large gap\nwith a second order parameter distinct from superconductivity. We use\nangle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) to show that the two-gap\nbehavior, and the destruction of well defined electronic excitations, are not\nuniversal features of HTSCs, and depend sensitively on how the underdoped\nmaterials are prepared. Depending on cation substitution, underdoped samples\neither show two-gap behavior or not. In contrast, many other characteristics of\nHTSCs, such as the domelike dependence of Tc on doping, long-lived excitations\nalong the diagonals to the Cu-O bonds, energy gap at the antinode (crossing of\nthe underlying Fermi surface and the (pi, 0)-(pi, pi) line) decreasing\nmonotonically with doping, while persisting above Tc (the pseudogap), are\npresent in all samples, irrespective of whether they exhibit two-gap behavior\nor not. Our results imply that universal aspects of high Tc superconductivity\nare relatively insensitive to differences in the electronic states along the\nCu-O bond directions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Sep 2013 20:42:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-25"}

For both methods we apply\nGirsanov's measure transformation to obtain an equivalent dynamic team problem\nunder a reference probability measure, so that the observations and information\nstructures available for decisions, are not affected by any of the team\ndecisions. The first method is based on function space integration with respect\nto products of Wiener measures, and generalizes Witsenhausen's [1] definition\nof equivalence between discrete-time static and dynamic team problems. The\nsecond method is based on stochastic Pontryagin's maximum principle. The team\noptimality conditions are given by a \"Hamiltonian System\" consisting of forward\nand backward stochastic differential equations, and a conditional variational\nHamiltonian with respect to the information structure of each team member,\nexpressed under the initial and a reference probability space via Girsanov's\nmeasure transformation.

The existing models for synthesizing and\nallocating forces in such suspensions are conservatively based on the\nconstraint that no wheels lift off the ground. However, in practice,\nsmart/active suspensions are more necessary in the situation where the wheels\nhave just lifted off the ground. The difficulty in computing control in the\nlast situation is that the problem requires satisfying disjunctive constraints\non the dynamics. To the authors',knowledge, no efficient solution method is\navailable for the simulation of dynamics with disjunctive constraints and thus\nhardware realizable and accurate force allocation in an active suspension tends\nto be a difficulty. In this work we give an algorithm for and simulate\nnumerical solutions of the force allocation problem as an optimal control\nproblem constrained by dynamics with disjunctive constraints. In particular we\nstudy the allocation and synthesis of time-dependent active suspension forces\nin terms of sensor output data in order to stabilize the roll motion of the\nroad vehicle. An equivalent constraint in the form of a convex combination\n(hull) is proposed to satisfy the disjunctive constraints.

This\nstudy shows that the online memory cost is minimized when the head is placed at\nthe center, regardless of the function that transforms length into cost,\nprovided only that this function is strictly monotonically increasing. Online\nmemory defines a quasi-convex adaptive landscape with a single central minimum\nif the number of elements is odd and two central minima if that number is even.\nWe discuss various aspects of the dynamics of word order of subject (S), verb\n(V) and object (O) from a complex systems perspective and suggest that word\norders tend to evolve by swapping adjacent constituents from an initial or\nearly SOV configuration that is attracted towards a central word order by\nonline memory minimization. We also suggest that the stability of SVO is due to\nat least two factors, the quasi-convex shape of the adaptive landscape in the\nonline memory dimension and online memory adaptations that avoid regression to\nSOV. Although OVS is also optimal for placing the verb at the center, its low\nfrequency is explained by its long distance to the seminal SOV in the\npermutation space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Sep 2013 08:31:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 15 Mar 2015 07:12:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-24"}

The lifetimes of the\nturbulent phases have an exponential distribution and the mean lifetimes tau\ngrow very rapidly with increasing driving force, namely as tau(F) ~ exp\n[(F/F1)^2]. In this work this experimental result is analyzed in more detail\nthan before, in particular the force F1 is identified. As a result, the\nturbulent drag force F(v) ~ (v^2 - vc^2) can be ascribed quantitatively to the\nshedding of vortex rings having the size of the sphere.

The present\npaper concerns the Antoinist Cult community (ACC), which has appeared at the\nend of the 19-th century in Belgium, have had quite an expansion, and is now\ndecaying. The historical perspective is described in an Appendix. Although\nsurely of marginal importance in religious history, the numerical and analytic\ndescription of the ACC growth AND decay evolution per se should hopefully\npermit generalizations toward behaviors of other sects, with either longer life\ntime, i.e. so called religions or churches, or to others with shorter life\ntime. Due to the specific aims and rules of the community, in particular the\nlack of proselytism, and strict acceptance of only anonymous financial gifts,\nan indirect measure of their member number evolution can only be studied. This\nis done here first through the time dependence of new temple inaugurations,\nbetween 1910 and 1940. Besides, the community yearly financial reports can be\nanalyzed. They are legally known between 1920 and 2000. Interestingly, several\nregimes are seen, with different time spans. The agent based model chosen to\ndescribe both temple number and finance evolutions is the Verhulst logistic\nfunction taking into account the limited resources of the population. Such a\nfunction remarkably fits the number of temple evolution, taking into account a\nno construction time gap, historically explained. The empirical Gompertz law\ncan also be used for fitting this number of temple evolution data, as shown in\nan Appendix. It is thereby concluded that strong social forces have been acting\nboth in the growth and decay phases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Sep 2013 15:08:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-20"}

They asserted that their results confirmed\nthe validity of a universally valid uncertainty relation proposed by Ozawa.\nTherefore, their results demonstrate unexpectedly that Ozawa's uncertainty\nrelation holds true for incorrect measurements.
