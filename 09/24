First, ferromagnetism was predicted for dilute magnetic doping.\nIn comprehensive investigation of ZnO:Co thin films based on the combined\nmeasurement of macroscopic and microscopic properties, we find no evidence for\ncarrier-mediated itinerant ferromagnetism. Phase-pure, crystallographically\nexcellent ZnO:Co is uniformly paramagnetic. Superparamagnetism arises when\nphase separation or defect formation occurs, due to nanometer-sized metallic\nprecipitates. Other compounds like ZnO:(Li,Ni) and ZnO:Cu do not exhibit\nindication of ferromagnetism.\n  Second, its small spin-orbit coupling and correspondingly large spin\ncoherence length makes ZnO suitable for transporting or manipulating spins in\nspintronic devices. From optical pump/optical probe experiments, we find a spin\ndephasing time of the order of 15 ns at low temperatures which we attribute to\nelectrons bound to Al donors. In all-electrical magnetotransport measurements,\nwe successfully create and detect a spin-polarized ensemble of electrons and\ntransport this spin information across several nanometers. We derive a spin\nlifetime of 2.6 ns for these itinerant spins at low temperatures, corresponding\nwell to results from an electrical pump/optical probe experiment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Sep 2013 16:02:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-08"}

We consider stellar progenitors with initial mass of 12,\n15, 19 and 25 Msun that explode as supernovae with stratified ejecta. The\nmolecular precursors to dust grains comprise molecular chains, rings and small\nclusters of silica, silicates, metal oxides, sulphides and carbides, pure\nmetals, and carbon, where the nucleation of silicate clusters is described by a\ntwo-step process of metal and oxygen addition. We study the impact of the 56Ni\nmass on the type and amount of synthesised dust. We predict that large masses\nof molecules including CO, SiO, SiS, O2, and SO form in the ejecta. We show\nthat the discrepancy between the small dust masses detected at infrared\nwavelengths some 500 days post-explosion and the larger amounts of dust\nrecently detected with Herschel in supernova remnants can be explained by the\nnon-equilibrium chemistry linked to the formation of molecules and dust\nclusters in the ejected material. Dust gradually builds up from small (~10^{-5}\nMsun) to large masses (~5x 10^{-2} Msun) over a 5 yr period after explosion.\nSubsequent dust formation and/or growth is hampered by the shortage of chemical\nagents participating in the dust nucleation and the long time scale for\naccretion. The results highlight the dependence of the dust chemical\ncomposition and mass on the amount of 56Ni synthesised during the explosion.\nThis dependence may partly explain the diversity of epochs at which dust forms\nin supernovae.

This result easily implies the tropical analogue of the mirror\nsymmetry statement mentioned above and, using the necessary Correspondence\nTheorem, also the mirror symmetry statement itself. In this way, our tropical\ngeneralization leads to an alternative proof of mirror symmetry for elliptic\ncurves.

The condition that its tropicalisation is non-negative\ndetermines its subset. For SL(2), we recover the set of integral laminations on\nS. We prove that when S is a disc with n special points on the boundary, this\nset parametrises top dimensional components of the convolution varieties. Thus,\nvia geometric Satake correspondence, they provide a canonical basis in tensor\nproduct invariants of irreducible modules for the Langlands dual group. When\nG=GL(m), n=3, there is a special coordinate system on A(G,S). We show that it\nidentifies our set with the set of with Knutson-Tao's hives. Our result\ngeneralises a theorem of Kamnitzer, who used hives to parametrise top\ncomponents of convolution varieties for GL(m), n=3. For n>3, we prove\nKamnitzer's conjecture. We define canonical bases in tensor products,\ngeneralizing the Mirkovic-Vilonen basis in a single representation. We prove\nthat for any S, the set of positive integral tropical points of A(G, S)\nparametrise top components in a new space, surface affine Grasmannian. We view\nW as a potential for Landau-Ginzburg model on A(G,S). We conjecture that the\npair (A(G,S), W) is the mirror dual to the moduli space of local systems on S\nfor the Langlands dual group. In a special case, we recover Givental's\ndescription of the quantum cohomology connection for flag varieties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Sep 2013 19:16:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 7 Dec 2014 16:18:51 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 23 Oct 2019 03:28:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-24"}

Our analysis is based on recent observational\nmeasurements and data from a suite of six simulations of the interstellar\nmedium, including effects of self-gravity, turbulence, magnetic field, and\nmultiphase thermodynamics. Simulations of isothermal supersonic turbulence\nreproduce observed slopes in linewidth-size and mass-size relations. Whether or\nnot self-gravity is included, the linewidth-size relation remains the same. The\nmass-size relation, instead, substantially flattens below the sonic scale, as\nprestellar cores start to form. Our multiphase models with magnetic field and\ndomain size 200 pc reproduce both scaling and normalization of the first Larson\nlaw. The simulations support a turbulent interpretation of Larson's relations.\nThis interpretation implies that: (i) the slopes of linewidth-size and\nmass-size correlations are determined by the inertial cascade; (ii) none of the\nthree Larson laws is fundamental; (iii) instead, if one is known, the other two\nfollow from scale invariance of the kinetic energy transfer rate. It does not\nimply that gravity is dynamically unimportant. The self-similarity of structure\nestablished by the turbulence breaks in star-forming clouds due to the\ndevelopment of gravitational instability in the vicinity of the sonic scale.\nThe instability leads to the formation of prestellar cores with the\ncharacteristic mass set by the sonic scale. The high-end slope of the core mass\nfunction predicted by the scaling relations is consistent with the Salpeter\npower-law index.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Sep 2013 19:25:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Oct 2013 21:42:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-04"}

Following our earlier\nwork showing that the ionisation level of absorbers was a primary factor in\ndetermining the physical conditions of absorbing gas, we show here that it is\nalso a governing factor for its dynamical state. Low-ionisation metal absorbers\n(e.g. MgII) tend to arise in gas that will fall onto galaxies within several\nGyr, while high-ionisation metal absorbers (e.g. OVI) generally trace material\nthat was deposited by outflows many Gyr ago. Inflowing gas is dominated by\nenriched material that was previously ejected in an outflow, hence accretion at\nlow redshifts is typically substantially enriched. Recycling wind material is\npreferentially found closer to galaxies, and is more dominant in lower-mass\nhalos since high-mass halos have more hot gas that is able to support itself\nagainst infall. Low-mass halos also tend to re-eject more of their accreted\nmaterial, owing to our outflow prescription that employs higher mass loading\nfactors for lower-mass galaxies. Typical HI absorbers trace unenriched ambient\nmaterial that is not participating in the baryon cycle, but stronger HI\nabsorbers arise in cool, enriched inflowing gas. Instantaneous radial velocity\nmeasures of absorbers are generally poor at distinguishing between inflowing\nand outflowing gas, except in the case of very recent outflows.

However, stellar winds of solar analogs are poorly constrained due\nto the challenges in observing them. A great improvement has been made in the\nlast decade in our understanding of the mechanisms responsible for the\nacceleration of the solar wind and in the development of numerical models for\nsolar and stellar winds. In this paper, we present a grid of\nMagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models to study and quantify the values of stellar\nmass-loss and angular momentum loss rates as a function of the stellar rotation\nperiod, magnetic dipole component, and coronal base density. We derive simple\nscaling laws for the loss rates as a function of these parameters, and\nconstrain the possible mass-loss rate of stars with thermally-driven winds.\nDespite the success of our scaling law in matching the results of the model, we\nfind a deviation between the \"solar dipole\" case and a real case based on solar\nobservations that overestimates the actual solar mass-loss rate by a factor of\n3. This implies that the model for stellar fields might require a further\ninvestigation with higher complexity which might include the use of a filling\nfactor for active regions, as well as the distribution of the strength of the\nsmall-scale fields. Mass loss rates in general are largely controlled by the\nmagnetic field strength, with the wind density varying in proportion to the\nconfining magnetic pressure $B^2$. We also find that the mass-loss rates\nobtained using our grid models drop much faster with the increase in rotation\nperiod than scaling laws derived using observed stellar activity. For\nmain-sequence solar-like stars, our scaling law for angular momentum loss vs.\npoloidal magnetic field strength retrieves the well-known Skumanich decline of\nangular velocity with time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Sep 2013 20:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Jan 2014 15:15:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

The breaking is then\ndynamically mediated to the visible sector and is manifested via\nnon-renormalizable operators at low energy. Consequently, RPV operators\noriginate from the Kahler potential rather than the superpotential, and are\nnaturally suppressed by the SUSY-breaking scale, explaining their small\nmagnitudes. A new set of non-holomorphic RPV operators are identified and found\nto often dominate over the standard RPV ones. We study the relevant low-energy\nconstraints arising from baryon-number violating processes, proton decay and\nflavor changing neutral currents, which may all be satisfied if a solution to\nthe Standard Model flavor puzzle is incorporated. The chiral structure of the\nRPV operators imply new and distinct collider signatures, indicating the need\nto alter current techniques in searching for RPV at the LHC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Sep 2013 20:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-23"}

Smooth accretion\ndominates the long-term evolution, with black hole mergers with mass ratios\n>1:5 representing typically a small fraction of the total growth. Winds from\nthe accretion disk are required to eject significant mass to suppress black\nhole growth, but there is no need for coupling this wind to galactic-scale gas\nto regulate black holes in a non-linear feedback loop. Torque-limited growth\nyields a close-to-linear relation for the star formation rate and the black\nhole accretion rate averaged over galaxy evolution time scales. However, the\nSFR-AGN connection has significant scatter owing to strong variability of black\nhole accretion at all resolved time scales. Eddington ratios can be described\nby a broad lognormal distribution with median value evolving roughly as (1 +\nz)^1.9, suggesting a main sequence for black hole growth similar to the cosmic\nevolution of specific SFRs.

These deviations are often attributed to two-level\nsystems of uncertain origin. We find that a source of excess specific heat\ncomes from correlations between quanta of energy if phonon-like excitations are\nlocalized on an intermediate length scale. We use simulations of a simplified\nCreutz model for a system of Ising-like spins coupled to a thermal bath of\nEinstein-like oscillators. One feature of this model is that energy is\nquantized in both the system and its bath, ensuring conservation of energy at\nevery step. Another feature is that the exact entropies of both the system and\nits bath are known at every step, so that their temperatures can be determined\nindependently. We find that there is a mismatch in canonical temperature\nbetween the system and its bath. In addition to the usual finite-size effects\nin the Bose-Einstein and Fermi-Dirac distributions, if excitations in the heat\nbath are localized on an intermediate length scale, this mismatch is\nindependent of system size up to at least 10^6 particles. We use a model for\ncorrelations between quanta of energy to adjust the statistical distributions\nand yield a thermodynamically consistent temperature.

We compared the model expectations of four emission models and the\nLAT data.

A discrepancy between the\nradio-loud/radio-quiet objects ratio was also found between the observed and\npredicted samples. The gamma-ray luminosity proportional to the 0.5 power of\nthe spin-down power relation is robustly confirmed by all the assumed models\nwith particular agreement in the slot gap (SG) case. On luminosity bases, the\nintermediate altitude emission of the two pole caustic SG model is favoured.\nThe beaming factor shows an spin-down power dependency that is slightly visible\nin theSG case. Estimates of the pulsar orientations have been obtained to\nexplain the simultaneous gamma and radio light-curves. By analysing the\nsolutions we found a relation between the observed energy cutoff and the width\nof the emission slot gap. This relation has been theoretically predicted. A\npossible magnetic obliquity alignment with time is rejected -for all the\nmodels- on timescale of the order of a million years. The light-curve\nmorphology study shows that the outer magnetosphere gap emission are favoured\nto explain the observed radio-gamma lag. The light curve moment studies\n(symmetry and sharpness) on the contrary favour a two pole caustic slot gap\nemission. All the model predictions suggest a different magnetic field layout\nwith an hybrid two pole caustic and intermediate altitude emission to explain\nboth the pulsar luminosity and light curve morphology .

The\npresence of these objects typically induces complicated dynamics in the compact\ndimensions such that a full solution to the 10d equations of motion is often\nout of reach. In order to still be able to make statements about the 4d\neffective theory arising in the low-energy limit, the equations of motion are\nusually only solved in an integrated sense, while the backreaction of the\nlocalised sources on the internal fields is neglected. This simplification is\noften referred to as smearing. In this work, we investigate to what extent\nsmearing may affect observables in the effective low-energy theory and whether\nit may lead to fake solutions that would cease to exist once the backreaction\nis properly taken into account. We analyse explicit examples for which smeared\nsolutions exist and find that the reliability of the smeared approximation\nappears to depend on whether or not these solutions saturate a BPS bound. We\nalso address the proposal of placing anti-D3-branes at the tip of a warped\nthroat geometry like the Klebanov-Strassler solution in order to construct\nmeta-stable de Sitter vacua in string theory. We show that, under a few general\nassumptions, the backreaction of the fully localised anti-branes yields a\nsingularity in fields that do not directly couple to them, and we give an\nargument suggesting that the singularity is not resolved by brane polarisation.\nWe furthermore demonstrate that, in many string compactifications involving\nnon-trivial background fluxes, the effective lower-dimensional cosmological\nconstant is determined by the on-shell action of the localised sources present\nin the solution. This often allows to compute the cosmological constant without\nresorting to potentially unreliable approximations like smearing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Sep 2013 21:47:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-25"}

We first consider bilayer graphene\nsubject to a spatially varying electrostatic potential that forms two\nneighbouring regions with opposite interlayer bias. Along the boundary, 1D\nchiral \"kink\" states emerge. We find that these 1D modes behave as a strongly\ninteracting Luttinger liquid whose properties can be tuned via an external\ngate. Next, we consider superlattices in bilayer graphene. Superlattices are\nseen to have a more dramatic effect on bilayer graphene than monolayer graphene\nbecause the quasi-particles are changed in a fundamental way; the dispersion\ngoes from a quadratic band touching point to linearly dispersing Dirac cones.\nWe illustrate that a 1D superlattice of either the chemical potential or an\ninterlayer bias generates multiple anisotropic Dirac cones. General arguments\ndelineate how certain symmetries protect the Dirac points. We then map the\nHamiltonian of an interlayer bias superlattice onto a chain model comprised of\n\"topological\" modes.

This paper considers a fundamental question: When is it\npossible to estimate low-dimensional parameters at parametric square-root rate\nin a large Gaussian graphical model? A novel regression approach is proposed to\nobtain asymptotically efficient estimation of each entry of a precision matrix\nunder a sparseness condition relative to the sample size. When the precision\nmatrix is not sufficiently sparse, or equivalently the sample size is not\nsufficiently large, a lower bound is established to show that it is no longer\npossible to achieve the parametric rate in the estimation of each entry. This\nlower bound result, which provides an answer to the delicate sample size\nquestion, is established with a novel construction of a subset of sparse\nprecision matrices in an application of Le Cam's lemma. Moreover, the proposed\nestimator is proven to have optimal convergence rate when the parametric rate\ncannot be achieved, under a minimal sample requirement. The proposed estimator\nis applied to test the presence of an edge in the Gaussian graphical model or\nto recover the support of the entire model, to obtain adaptive rate-optimal\nestimation of the entire precision matrix as measured by the matrix $\\ell_q$\noperator norm and to make inference in latent variables in the graphical model.\nAll of this is achieved under a sparsity condition on the precision matrix and\na side condition on the range of its spectrum. This significantly relaxes the\ncommonly imposed uniform signal strength condition on the precision matrix,\nirrepresentability condition on the Hessian tensor operator of the covariance\nmatrix or the $\\ell_1$ constraint on the precision matrix.

Numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed\nscheme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Sep 2013 02:08:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-18"}

This error indicator is\nfurther used to develop an adaptive enrichment algorithm for the linear\nelliptic equation with multiscale high-contrast coefficients. The GMsFEM, which\nhas recently been introduced in [12], allows solving multiscale\nparameter-dependent problems at a reduced computational cost by constructing a\nreduced-order representation of the solution on a coarse grid. The main idea of\nthe method consists of (1) the construction of snapshot space, (2) the\nconstruction of the offline space, and (3) the construction of the online space\n(the latter for parameter-dependent problems). In [12], it was shown that the\nGMsFEM provides a flexible tool to solve multiscale problems with a complex\ninput space by generating appropriate snapshot, offline, and online spaces. In\nthis paper, we study an adaptive enrichment procedure and derive an\na-posteriori error indicator which gives an estimate of the local error over\ncoarse grid regions. We consider two kinds of error indicators where one is\nbased on the $L^2$-norm of the local residual and the other is based on the\nweighted $H^{-1}$-norm of the local residual where the weight is related to the\ncoefficient of the elliptic equation. We show that the use of weighted\n$H^{-1}$-norm residual gives a more robust error indicator which works well for\ncases with high contrast media. The convergence analysis of the method is\ngiven. In our analysis, we do not consider the error due to the fine-grid\ndiscretization of local problems and only study the errors due to the\nenrichment.

The composition of\nexoplanetary interiors and atmospheres are particularly sensitive to elemental\nC/O ratio, which to first order can be estimated from the host stars.

The central engine of a GRB can collimate relativistic\njets that propagate inside the stellar envelope. The shock waves produced when\nthe jet disrupts the stellar surface are capable of accelerating particles up\nto very high energies. If the jet has hadronic content, neutrinos will be\nproduced via charged pion decays. The main goal of this work is to estimate the\nneutrino emission produced in the region close to the surface of the star,\ntaking pion and muon cooling into account, along with subtle effects arising\nfrom neutrino production in a highly magnetized medium. We estimate the maximum\nenergies of the different kinds of particles and solve the coupled transport\nequations for each species. Once the particle distributions are known, we\ncalculate the intensity of neutrinos. We study the different effects on the\nneutrinos that can change the relative weight of different flavors.

However, measurements\nof rotational velocities require galaxy inclinations, which are difficult to\nmeasure, thus limiting the range of TFR studies. This work introduces a maximum\nlikelihood estimation (MLE) method for recovering the TFR in galaxy samples\nwith limited or no information on inclinations. The robustness and accuracy of\nthis method is demonstrated using virtual and real galaxy samples.\nIntriguingly, the MLE reliably recovers the TFR of all test samples, even\nwithout using any inclination measurements - that is, assuming a\nsin(i)-distribution for galaxy inclinations. Explicitly, this 'inclination-free\nMLE' recovers the three TFR parameters (zero-point, slope, scatter) with\nstatistical errors only about 1.5-times larger than the best estimates based on\nperfectly known galaxy inclinations with zero uncertainty. Thus, given\nrealistic uncertainties, the inclination-free MLE is highly competitive. If\ninclination measurements have mean errors larger than 10 degrees, it is better\nnot to use any inclinations, than to consider the inclination measurements to\nbe exact. The inclination-free MLE opens interesting perspectives for future HI\nsurveys by the SKA and its pathfinders.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Sep 2013 05:40:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

Separation of the two different emission components\nis crucial to study the properties of diffuse interstellar medium. The Cygnus X\nregion is one of the most complex areas in the radio sky which contains a\nnumber of massive stars and HII regions on the diffuse thermal and non-thermal\nbackground. More supernova remnants are expected to be discovered. We aim to\ndevelop a method which can properly separate the non-thermal and thermal radio\ncontinuum emission and apply it to the Cygnus X region. The result can be used\nto study the properties of different emission components and search for new\nsupernova remnants in the complex. Multi-frequency radio continuum data from\nlarge-scale surveys are used to develop a new component separation method.\nSpectral analysis is done pixel by pixel for the non-thermal synchrotron\nemission with a realistic spectral index distribution and a fixed spectral\nindex of beta = -2.1 for the thermal bremsstrahlung emission. With the new\nmethod, we separate the non-thermal and thermal components of the Cygnus X\nregion at an angular resolution of 9.5arcmin. The thermal emission component is\nfound to comprise 75% of the total continuum emission at 6cm. Thermal diffuse\nemission, rather than the discrete HII regions, is found to be the major\ncontributor to the entire thermal budget. A smooth non-thermal emission\nbackground of 100 mK Tb is found. We successfully make the large-extent known\nsupernova remnants and the HII regions embedded in the complex standing out,\nbut no new large SNRs brighter than Sigma_1GHz = 3.7 x 10^-21 W m^-2 Hz^-1\nsr^-1 are found.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Sep 2013 07:29:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

The\ndata processing steps to arrive at a consistent and homogeneous calibration are\noutlined. In the current state the relative photometric accuracy is around 2%\nin all bands. Starting from the present calibration status, the\ncharacterization and correction for instrumental effects affecting the relative\ncalibration accuracy is described and an outlook for the final achievable\ncalibration numbers is given. After including all the correction for the\ninstrumental effects, the relative photometric calibration accuracy\n(repeatability) will be as good as 0.5% in the blue and green band and 2% in\nthe red band. This excellent calibration starts to reveal possible\ninconsistencies between the models of the K-type and the M-type stellar\ncalibrators.

In this work we analyzed the data of the recent\nrelease of observations obtained from M82 X-1 taken by XMM-Newton. We performed\na study of the timing and spectral properties of the source. We report on the\ndetection of (46+-2) mHz Quasi-Periodic Oscillations (QPOs) in the power\ndensity spectra of two observations. A comparison of the frequency of these\nhigh-frequency QPOs with previous detections supports the 1:2:3 frequency\ndistribution as suggested in other studies. We discuss the implications if the\n(46+-2) mHz QPO detected in M82 X-1 is the fundamental harmonic, in analogy\nwith the High-Frequency QPOs observed in black hole binaries. For one of the\nobservations we have detected for the first time a QPO at 8 mHz (albeit at a\nlow significance), that coincides with a hardening of the spectrum. We suggest\nthat the QPO is a milli-hertz QPO originating from the close-by transient ULX\nM82 X-2, with analogies to the Low-Frequency QPOs observed in black hole\nbinaries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Sep 2013 10:10:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

In a nutshell, PM divides the graph into small\nsubgraphs using our novel randomized partitioning scheme, runs the centralized\nalgorithm on each partition separately, and then stitches the resulting\nsolutions to produce a global solution. We demonstrate the efficiency of the PM\nalgorithm on two popular problems: computation of Maximum A Posteriori (MAP)\nassignment in an arbitrary pairwise Markov Random Field (MRF), and modularity\noptimization for community detection. We show that the resulting distributed\nalgorithms for these problems essentially run in time linear in the number of\nnodes in the graph, and perform as well -- or even better -- than the original\ncentralized algorithm as long as the graph has geometric structures. Here we\nsay a graph has geometric structures, or polynomial growth property, when the\nnumber of nodes within distance r of any given node grows no faster than a\npolynomial function of r.

The oldest stellar populations of the dSphs and dTrs are, within the\nuncertainties, coeval ($\\sim 13 Gyr$) at all galactocentric radii. We find that\nthere are no significative differences between the four galaxies in the\nfundamental properties (such as the normalized star formation rate or\nage-metallicity relation) of their outer regions (radii greater than four\nexponential scale lengths); at large radii, these galaxies consist exclusively\nof old ($\\geq 10.5 Gyr$) metal-poor stars.

This\ncontrasts with the two dSph galaxies. Tucana shows a similar, but milder,\ngradient, but no gradient in age is detected Cetus. For the three galaxies with\nsignificant stellar population gradients, the exponential scale length\ndecreases with time.

We propose a new path-based distance measure to compare two\nplanar geometric graphs embedded in the plane.

It tends to tame the complexity of systems, to facilitate\ntheir management, and to enhance their flexibility with respect to evolution.\nIn software, modularization has been practiced and studied thoroughly in local,\ni.e. non-distributed systems. But very little attention has been paid so far to\nmodularization in distributed systems. This is, in part, because distributed\nsystems are inherently modularized, in the sense that the internals of each\ncomponent of such a system is inaccessible to other components, thus satisfying\nthe Parnas hiding principle. It is, however, the thesis of this paper that\nthere is much to be gained by being able to treat groups of distributed\ncomponents as modules, called here distributed modules. And that besides the\nconventional hiding principle, distributed modularization should provide\nadditional capabilities, which rarely, if ever, figure in conventional\nmodularized systems. These capabilities include, but are not limited to: the\nability to impose constraints on which kind of messages can be sent from a\ngiven distributed-module to its outside; and the ability to create AOP-like\ncrosscutting modules. This paper introduces a model of modular distributed\nsystem, orMDS, which satisfies such capabilities, and which is implemented via\nthe LGI middleware.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Sep 2013 12:46:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-25"}

Such simulations are challenging since streaming and deep\npenetration effects are equally important. In order to make such simulations\ntractable, both variance reduction (VR) techniques and parallel computing are\nused. It has been found that the application of VR techniques in such models\nsignificantly reduces the efficiency of parallel computation due to 'long\nhistories'. VR in MCNP can be accomplished using energy-dependent weight\nwindows. The weight window represents an 'average behaviour' of particles, and\nlarge deviations in the arriving weight of a particle give rise to extreme\namounts of splitting being performed and a long history. When running on\nparallel clusters, a long history can have a detrimental effect on the parallel\nefficiency - if one process is computing the long history, the other CPUs\ncomplete their batch of histories and wait idle. Furthermore some long\nhistories have been found to be effectively intractable. To combat this effect,\nCCFE has developed an adaptation of MCNP which dynamically adjusts the WW where\na large weight deviation is encountered. The method effectively 'de-optimises'\nthe WW, reducing the VR performance but this is offset by a significant\nincrease in parallel efficiency. Testing with a simple geometry has shown the\nmethod does not bias the result. This 'long history method' has enabled CCFE to\nsignificantly improve the performance of MCNP calculations for ITER on parallel\nclusters, and will be beneficial for any geometry combining streaming and deep\npenetration effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Sep 2013 14:11:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-25"}

It addresses an\nimportant example, the circuit of the original Bell's Theorem experiments for\nideal polarizers. Correct predictions emerge from two alternative simple but\ntime-symmetric models based on classical Markov Random Field across space time.\nExact agreement here does not violate Bell's Theorem itself, because the\ninterplay between initial and final outcomes in these calculations does not\nfall within the CHSH definition of time forwards causality.

The appendix\nworked out what the conventional predictions would be for the proposed\nexperiment, and also gives a simple master equation version of the collapse\nassumption which does not involve metaphysical observers. Section A.4 gives the\nprediction for the new models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Sep 2013 18:50:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Mar 2014 11:31:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 28 Mar 2014 19:04:40 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 9 Sep 2014 17:21:43 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 10 Sep 2014 18:15:42 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Tue, 19 Dec 2017 19:04:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-21"}

It is shown that,\nunder the uniqueness assumption of the optimal solution z* and for each (primal\nor dual) variable z_i, f_i is zero if and only if the optimal value z*_i is\nzero, and f_i is one if and only if z*_i is positive. Computation of f_i for\neach i consists of solving two groups of linear equations using O(m^2n)\noperations. Computing f_i is then non-iterative and independent of computing\nf_j for j <> i. Hence, at most O(m^2n^2) operations are required to compute f\nand consequently to solve the linear programming problem. The non-iterative and\nmutually independent features of computing the elements of f enable a parallel\npolynomial algorithm for linear programming.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Sep 2013 14:43:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 Sep 2013 14:33:28 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 7 Oct 2013 16:53:34 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 12 Nov 2013 11:02:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-13"}

We revise our\nprevious Herschel/HIFI observations, which consist of several 12CO and 13CO\nlines in the far-infrared/sub-mm band. These data have been re-analyzed in\ndetail by improving calibration, the signal-to-noise-ratio, and baseline\nsubstraction. We identify the contributions of the different nebular components\nto the line profiles. We have used a spatio-kinematical model to better\nconstrain the temperature, density, and kinematics of the molecular components\nprobed by the improved CO observations. The 12CO and 13CO J=16-15, J=10-9, and\nJ=6-5 transitions are detected in this source. The line profiles present a\ncomposite structure showing spectacular wings in some cases, which become\ndominant as the energy level increases. Our analysis of the high-energy CO\nemission with the already known low-energy J=2-1 and J=1-0 lines confirms that\nthe high-velocity component, or fast bipolar outflow, is hotter than previously\nestimated with a typical temperature of ~300 K. This component may then be an\nexample of a very recent acceleration of the gas by shocks that has not yet\ncooled down. We also find that the dense central core is characterized by a\nvery low expansion velocity, ~5 km/s, and a strong velocity gradient. We\nconclude that this component is very likely to be the unaltered circumstellar\nlayers that are lost in the last AGB phase, where the ejection velocity is\nparticularly low. The physical properties of the other two nebular components,\nthe diffuse halo and the double empty shell, more or less agrees with the\nestimations derived in previous models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Sep 2013 15:16:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

This important step is generally challenging\nfrom a computational viewpoint. In this paper, we provide an algorithmic\napproach to the construction of the well-known Vergne polarizing subalgebras\n\\cite{Corwin}. The algorithms presented in this paper are specifically designed\nso that they can be implemented in Computer Algebra Systems. We also show there\nare instances where Vergne's construction could be refined for the sake of\nefficiency. Finally, we adapt our refined procedure to free nilpotent\nfinite-dimensional Lie algebras of step-two to obtain simple and precise\ndescriptions of Vergne polarizing algebras corresponding to all linear\nfunctionals in a Zariski open subset of the linear dual of the corresponding\nLie algebra. Several explicit examples are given throughout the paper.

Results\nfrom our model are consistent with a wide range of recent experimental evidence\nthat excitons decay directly to well-defined polarons on a sub-100 fs\ntimescale, which is substantially faster than exciton relaxation processes.\nAveraging over multiple samples, we find that as the interfacial offset is\nincreased, a substantial fraction of the density of electronic states in the\nenergy region about the initial exciton carries significant charge-transfer\ncharacter with two charges separated in the outer regions of the model lattice.\nThe results indicate a slight increase in the density of such current-producing\nstates if the region close to the interface is more disordered. However, since\ntheir density of states overlaps the excitation line-shape of the primary\nexciton, we show that it is possible that the exciton can decay directly into\ncurrent-producing states via tunneling on an ultrafast time-scale. We find this\nprocess to be independent of the location of energetic disorder in the system,\nand hence we expect exciton fission via resonant tunnelling to be a ubiquitous\nfeature of these systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Sep 2013 21:53:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-26"}

The motivation of this paper is to\nput these strongly related theorems back in their historical perspective. More\nimportantly, we suggest a way to understand Descartes's original statement,\nwhich yet remains somewhat of an enigma. We found that this question is related\nto a certain way of counting the alternations and permanences of signs of the\npolynomial coefficients, and may have been the convention used by Descartes.\nRemarkably, this convention not only provides a ultra-simple proof of\nDescartes's rule, but it can also be used to simplify the proofs of the titular\ntheorems.

The change in labour force is the\ndriving force representing economic activity in the Phillips curve. For\nAustria, this macroeconomic variable was first tested as a predictor of\ninflation and unemployment in 2005 with the involved time series ended in 2003.\nHere we extend all series by nine new readings available since 2003 and\nre-estimate the previously estimated relationships between inflation,\nunemployment, and labour force. As before, a structural break is allowed in\nthese relationships, which is related to numerous changes in definitions in the\n1980s. The break year is estimated together with other model parameters by the\nBoundary Element Method with the LSQ fitting between observed and predicted\nintegral curves. The precision of inflation prediction, as described by the\nroot-mean-square (forecasting) error is by 20% to 70% better than that\nestimated by AR(1) model. The estimates of model forecasting error are\navailable for those time series where the change in labour force leads by one\n(the GDP deflator) or two (CPI) years. For the whole period between 1965 and\n2012 as well as for the intervals before and after the structural break (1986\nfor all inflation models) separately, our model is superior to the na\\\"ive\nforecasting, which in turn, is not worse than any other forecasting model. The\nlevel of statistical reliability and the predictive power of the link between\ninflation and labour force imply that the National Bank of Austria does not\ncontrol inflation and unemployment beyond revisions to definitions. The labour\nforce projection provided by Statistic Austria allows foreseeing inflation at a\nforty-year horizon: the rate of CPI inflation will hover around 1.3% and the\nGDP deflator will likely sink below zero between 2018 and 2034.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Sep 2013 09:59:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-08"}
