A graph is perfect if\nthe chromatic number equals the maximum clique number for every induced\nsubgraph. Chudnovsky, Robertson, Seymour and Thomas proved that every Berge\ngraph either falls into some classical family of perfect graphs, or has a\nstructural fault that cannot occur in a minimal imperfect graph. A corollary of\nthis is the strong perfect graph theorem conjectured by Berge: every Berge\ngraph is perfect. An even pair of vertices in a graph is a pair of vertices\nsuch that every induced path between them has even length. Meyniel proved that\na minimal imperfect graph cannot contain an even pair. So even pairs may be\nconsidered as a structural fault. Chudnovsky et al. do not use them, and it is\nknown that some classes of Berge graph have no even pairs.\n  The aim of this work is to investigate an \"even-pair-like\" notion that could\nbe a structural fault present in every Berge graph. An odd pair of cliques is a\npair of cliques $\\{K_1, K_2\\}$ such that every induced path from $K_1$ to $K_2$\nwith no interior vertex in $K_1 \\cup K_2$ has odd length. We conjecture that\nfor every Berge graph $G$ on at least two vertices, either one of $G, \\bar{G}$\nhas an even pair, or one of $G, \\bar{G}$ has an odd pair of cliques. We\nconjecture that a minimal imperfect graph has no odd pair of maximal cliques.\nWe prove these conjectures in some special cases. We show that adding all edges\nbetween any 2 vertices of the cliques of an odd pair of cliques is an operation\nthat preserves perfectness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Sep 2013 16:12:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-10"}

Understanding the influence of an IMBH\nin the center of a GC on its environment might provide indirect detection\nmethods. Our goal is to test the effects of different initial compositions of\nGCs on their evolution in a tidal field. We pin down the crucial observables\nthat indicate the presence of an IMBH at the center of the cluster. In addition\nto central IMBHs, we also consider the effects of different stellar-mass black\nhole retention and stellar binary fractions. We performed a set of 22 N-body\nsimulations and varied particle numbers, IMBH masses, stellar-mass black-hole\nretention fractions, and stellar binary fractions. These models are all run in\nan external tidal field to study the effect of black holes on the cluster mass\nloss, mass function, and life times. Finally, we compared our results with\nobservational data. We found that a central massive black hole increases the\nescape rate of high-mass stars from a star cluster, implying that the relative\ndepletion of the mass function at the low-mass end proceeds less rapidly.\nFurthermore, we found a similar behavior for a cluster hosting a high number of\nstellar-mass black holes instead of one massive central IMBH. The presence of\nan IMBH also weakly affects the fraction of the cluster mass that is\nconstituted by stellar remnants, as does the presence of primordial binaries.\nWe compared our simulations with observational data from the literature and\nfound good agreement between our models and observed mass functions and\nstructural parameters of GCs.

This is shown\nto be a universal quantity in the sense that it doesn't depend on the gauge\ncoupling and the gauge group, but may depend on the other couplings of the\naction (gravitational and matter). The coupled system is studied at one-loop.\nIt is found that the leading term of gauge beta function is zero at one-loop in\nfour dimensions. The effect of gauge fields on the running of gravitational\ncouplings is investigated. The coupled system of gauge field with\nhigher-derivative gravity is shown to satisfy unitarity when quantum\ncorrections are taken in to account. Moreover, it is found that Newton constant\ngoes to zero at short distances. In this renormalizable and unitary theory of\ngauge field coupled with higher-derivative gravity, the leading term of the\ngauge beta function, found to be universal for all gauge groups, is further\nstudied in more detail by isolating it in the context of abelian gauge theories\ncoupled with gravity in four dimensions. Using self-duality of abelian gauge\ntheories in four dimensions, this term of the gauge beta function is shown to\nbe zero to all loops.

An explicit one-loop\ncomputation for arbitrary gravity action further demonstrates the vanishing of\nthis term in the gauge beta function in four dimensions, independent of the\nregularization scheme and gauge fixing condition.

In the quantum formalism, indistinguishability is\nexpressed via the symmetrization postulate, which restricts a system of\nidentical particles to the set of symmetric states (`bosons') or the set of\nantisymmetric states (`fermions'). However, the physical basis and range of\nvalidity of the symmetrization postulate has not been established. A well-known\ntopological derivation of the postulate implies that its validity depends on\nthe dimensionality of the space in which the particles move. However, this\nderivation relies on the labeling of indistinguishable particles, a notion that\ncannot be justified on an informational basis. Here we show that the\nsymmetrization postulate can be derived by strictly adhering to the\ninformational requirement that particles which cannot be experimentally\ndistinguished from one another are not labeled. Our key novel postulate is the\noperational indistinguishability postulate, which posits that the amplitude of\na process involving several indistinguishable particles is determined by the\namplitudes of all possible transitions of these particles when treated as\ndistinguishable. The symmetrization postulate follows by requiring consistency\nwith the rest of the quantum formalism. The derivation implies that the\nsymmetrization postulate admits no natural variants. In particular, the\npossibility that identical particles generically exhibit anyonic behavior in\ntwo dimensions is excluded.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Sep 2013 18:01:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 8 Jun 2014 16:53:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-10"}

Using 200 N-body simulations covering a total\ncomoving volume of 675 (Gpc/h)^3, we measure several 2- and 3-point statistics\nof the halo distribution to unprecedented accuracy.

The extent to\nwhich the results of these Galaxy-based studies can be extrapolated to\nextragalactic systems depends on the overlap of the environmental conditions\nprobed. In this paper, we compare the properties of clouds and star-forming\nregions in the MW with those in nearby galaxies and in the high-redshift\nUniverse. We find that in terms of their baryonic composition, kinematics, and\ndensities, the clouds in the solar neighbourhood are similar to those in nearby\ngalaxies. The clouds and regions in the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ, i.e. the\ninner 250 pc) of the MW are indistinguishable from high-redshift clouds and\ngalaxies. The presently low star formation rate in the CMZ therefore implies\nthat either (1) its gas represents the initial conditions for high-redshift\nstarbursts or (2) some yet unidentified process consistently suppresses star\nformation over >100 Myr time-scales. We conclude that the MW contains large\nreservoirs of gas with properties directly comparable to most of the known\nrange of star formation environments and is therefore an excellent template for\nstudying star formation across cosmological time-scales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Sep 2013 20:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

In particular, we aim to\ncharacterise the conditions under which a protoplanetary disc may undergo\n`thermal sweeping', a rapid (< 1e4 years) disc destruction mechanism proposed\nto occur when a clearing disc reaches sufficiently low surface density at its\ninner edge and where the disc is unstable to runaway penetration by the X-rays.\nWe use a large suite of 1D radiation-hydrodynamic simulations to probe the\nobservable parameter space, which is unfeasible in higher dimensions. These\nmodels allow us to determine the surface density at which thermal sweeping will\ntake over the disc's evolution and to evaluate this critical surface density as\na function of X-ray luminosity, stellar mass and inner hole radius. We find\nthat this critical surface density scales linearly with X-ray luminosity,\nincreases with inner hole radius and decreases with stellar mass and we develop\nan analytic model that reproduces these results.\n  This surface density criterion is then used to determine the evolutionary\nstate of protoplanetary discs at the point that they become unstable to\ndestruction by thermal sweeping. We find that transition discs created by\nphotoevaporation will undergo thermal sweeping when their inner holes reach\n20-40 AU, implying that transition discs with large holes and no accretion\n(which were previously a predicted outcome of the later stages of all flavours\nof photoevaporation model) will not form.\n  We emphasise that the surface density criteria that we have developed apply\nto all situations where the disc develops an inner hole that is optically thin\nto X-rays. It thus applies not only to the case of holes originally created by\nphotoevaporation but also to holes formed, for example, by the tidal influence\nof planets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Sep 2013 20:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

CROM constitutes a\npotential alternative to POD models and generalises the Ulam-Galerkin method\nclassically used in dynamical systems to determine a finite-rank approximation\nof the Perron-Frobenius operator. The proposed strategy processes a\ntime-resolved sequence of flow snapshots in two steps. First, the snapshot data\nare clustered into a small number of representative states, called centroids,\nin the state space. These centroids partition the state space in complementary\nnon-overlapping regions (centroidal Voronoi cells). Departing from the standard\nalgorithm, the probabilities of the clusters are determined, and the states are\nsorted by analysis of the transition matrix. Secondly, the transitions between\nthe states are dynamically modelled using a Markov process. Physical mechanisms\nare then distilled by a refined analysis of the Markov process, e.g. using\nfinite-time Lyapunov exponent and entropic methods. This CROM framework is\napplied to the Lorenz attractor (as illustrative example), to velocity fields\nof the spatially evolving incompressible mixing layer and the three-dimensional\nturbulent wake of a bluff body. For these examples, CROM is shown to identify\nnon-trivial quasi-attractors and transition processes in an unsupervised\nmanner. CROM has numerous potential applications for the systematic\nidentification of physical mechanisms of complex dynamics, for comparison of\nflow evolution models, for the identification of precursors to desirable and\nundesirable events, and for flow control applications exploiting nonlinear\nactuation dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Sep 2013 20:10:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 Jun 2014 11:12:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-11"}

This ratio is\nbroadly equivalent to the average level of extremely metal-poor stars in the\nGalactic halo, suggesting that N released from asymptotic giant branch (AGB)\nstars is missing in the present-day interstellar matter of these dIrrs. We find\nevidence for past tidal interactions in the properties of individual dIrrs\nexhibiting low N/O ratios, while a clear signature of interactions is unseen\nfor dIrrs with high N/O ratios. Accordingly, we propose that the ejecta of\nmassive AGB stars that correspond to a major production site of N can be\nstripped from dIrrs that have undergone a strong interaction with a luminous\ngalaxy. The physical process of its stripping is made up of two stages: (i) the\nejecta of massive AGB stars in a dIrr are first merged with those of the\nbursting prompt SNe Ia and pushed up together to the galaxy halo, and (ii)\nsubsequently through tidal interactions with a luminous galaxy, these ejecta\nare stripped from a dwarf galaxy's potential well. Our new chemical evolution\nmodels with stripping of AGB ejecta succeed in reproducing the observed low N/O\nratio. Furthermore, we perform N-body + hydrodynamical simulations to trace the\nfate of AGB ejecta inside a dIrr orbiting the Milky Way, and confirm that a\ntidal interaction is responsible for the efficient stripping of AGB ejecta from\ndIrrs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Sep 2013 20:11:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

Under that assumption, necessary and sufficient conditions\non M are known for DM to be a right or left fir, and various conditions on M\nhave been proved necessary or sufficient for DM to be a 2-fir or semifir.\n  A sufficient condition for DM to be a semifir is that M be a direct limit of\nmonoids which are free products of free monoids and free groups.

Using these, we show that for M a monoid such\nthat DM is a 2-fir, mutual commutativity is an equivalence relation on\nnonidentity elements of M, and each equivalence class, together with the\nidentity element, is a directed union of infinite cyclic groups or infinite\ncyclic monoids.\n  Several open questions are noted.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Sep 2013 00:31:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 5 Feb 2014 23:44:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-24"}

This process\nis an integral part of the \"supercritical pile\" GRB model, proposed a few years\nago to provide an account for the conversion of the GRB kinetic energy into\nradiation with a spectral peak at $E_{\\rm pk} \\sim m_ec^2$. We compute the\nevolution of the relativistic blast wave (RBW) Lorentz factor $\\Gamma$ to show\nthat the radiation--reaction force due to the GRB emission can produce an\nabrupt, small ($\\sim 25%$) decrease in $\\Gamma$ at a radius which is smaller\n(depending on conditions) than the deceleration radius $R_D$. Because of this\nreduction, the kinematic criticality criterion of the \"supercritical pile\" is\nno longer fulfilled. Transfer of the proton energy into electrons ceases, and\nthe GRB enters abruptly the afterglow phase at a luminosity smaller by $\\sim\nm_p/m_e$ than that of the prompt emission. If the radius at which this\nslow-down occurs is significantly smaller than $R_D$, the RBW internal energy\ncontinues to drive the RBW expansion at a constant (new) $\\Gamma$, and its\nX-ray luminosity remains constant until $R_D$ is reached, at which point it\nresumes its more conventional decay, thereby completing the \"unexpected\" XRT\nlight curve phase. If this transition occurs at $R \\simeq R_D$, the steep\ndecline is followed by a flux decrease instead of a \"plateau\", consistent with\nthe conventional afterglow declines. Besides providing an account of these\npeculiarities, the model suggests that the afterglow phase may in fact begin\nbefore the RBW reaches $R \\simeq R_D$, thus introducing novel insights into the\nGRB phenomenology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Sep 2013 01:03:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

Modeling bimodal behavior in discrete data is useful for\nvarious purposes, from comparing shapes of different samples (or survey\nquestions) to predicting future ratings by new raters. The Poisson distribution\nis the most common distribution for fitting count data and can be modified to\nachieve mixtures of truncated Poisson distributions. However, it is suitable\nonly for modeling equi-dispersed distributions and is limited in its ability to\ncapture bimodality. The Conway-Maxwell-Poisson (CMP) distribution is a\ntwo-parameter generalization of the Poisson distribution that allows for over-\nand under-dispersion. In this work, we propose a mixture of CMPs for capturing\na wide range of truncated discrete data, which can exhibit unimodal and bimodal\nbehavior. We present methods for estimating the parameters of a mixture of two\nCMP distributions using an EM approach. Our approach introduces a special\ntwo-step optimization within the M step to estimate multiple parameters. We\nexamine computational and theoretical issues.

We also aim to\ninvestigate their C, N, and O yields. Using the Monash University Stellar\nEvolution code we computed and analysed the evolution of stars of metallicity Z\n= 10^-5 and masses between 4 and 9 M_sun, from their main sequence until the\nlate thermally pulsing (super) asymptotic giant branch, TP-(S)AGB phase. Our\nmodel stars experience a strong C, N, and O envelope enrichment either due to\nthe second dredge-up, the dredge-out phenomenon, or the third dredge-up early\nduring the TP-(S)AGB phase. Their late evolution is therefore similar to that\nof higher metallicity objects. When using a standard prescription for the mass\nloss rates during the TP-(S)AGB phase, the computed stars lose most of their\nenvelopes before their cores reach the Chandrasekhar mass, so our standard\nmodels do not predict the occurrence of SNI1/2 for Z = 10^-5 stars. However, we\nfind that the reduction of only one order of magnitude in the mass-loss rates,\nwhich are particularly uncertain at this metallicity, would prevent the\ncomplete ejection of the envelope, allowing the stars to either explode as an\nSNI1/2 or become an electron-capture SN. Our calculations stop due to an\ninstability near the base of the convective envelope that hampers further\nconvergence and leaves remnant envelope masses between 0.25 M_sun for our 4\nM_sun model and 1.5 M_sun for our 9 M_sun model. We present two sets of C, N,\nand O yields derived from our full calculations and computed under two\ndifferent assumptions, namely, that the instability causes a practically\ninstant loss of the remnant envelope or that the stars recover and proceed with\nfurther thermal pulses. Our results have implications for the early chemical\nevolution of the Universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Sep 2013 07:30:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

We aim to set constraints on the\nphysical nature and causes of these highly Doppler-shifted signals. In\nparticular, the temporal relation between the appearance of transverse fields\nand the strong Doppler shifts is analyzed in some detail. We calculated the\ntime difference between the appearance of the strong flows and the linear\npolarization. We also obtained the distances from the center of various\nfeatures to the nearest neutral lines and whether they overlap or not. These\ndistances were compared with those obtained from randomly distributed points on\nobserved magnetograms. Various cases of strong flows are described in some\ndetail. The linear polarization signals precede the appearance of the strong\nflows by on average 84+-11 seconds. The strongly Doppler-shifted signals are\ncloser (0.19\") to magnetic neutral lines than randomly distributed points\n(0.5\"). Eighty percent of the strongly Doppler-shifted signals are close to a\nneutral line that is located between the emerging field and pre-existing\nfields. That the remaining 20% do not show a close-by pre-existing field could\nbe explained by a lack of sensitivity or an unfavorable geometry of the\npre-existing field, for instance, a canopy-like structure. Transverse fields\noccurred before the observation of the strong Doppler shifts. The process is\nmost naturally explained as the emergence of a granular-scale loop that first\ngives rise to the linear polarization signals, interacts with pre-existing\nfields (generating new neutral line configurations), and produces the observed\nstrong flows. This explanation is indicative of frequent small-scale\nreconnection events in the quiet Sun.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Sep 2013 09:44:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

Optical spectroscopy obtained a few years\nafter the eruption showed a faint M-type stellar spectrum underlying numerous\nmolecular and atomic emission features. It has recently been suggested that the\ncentral object in V4332 Sgr is now hidden in a dusty disc and that the\nphotospheric spectrum of this object observed in the optical results from\nscattering of the radiation of the central star on dust grains in the\ncircumstellar matter.

The results of our spectropolarimetric observations are in accord with\nthe proposed geometry of the system and the advocated nature of the observed\noptical spectrum of V4332 Sgr. The continuum is not seen directly but results\nfrom scattering on dust within the disc and polar outflow, while most of the\ngas emission comes from the polar outflow excited by the radiation field of the\ncentral source.

In order to better constrain\ntheoretical models, it is especially important to get information from the\nregion close to the physical base of the jet, where the plasma acceleration\ntakes place. In this paper, we report multi-epoch and multi-frequency continuum\nobservations of the z=2.5 blazar PKS1830-211 with ALMA, serendipitously\ncoincident with a strong $\\gamma$-ray flare reported by Fermi-LAT. The blazar\nis lensed by a foreground z=0.89 galaxy, with two bright images of the compact\ncore separated by 1\". Our ALMA observations individually resolve these two\nimages (although not any of their substructures), and we study the change of\ntheir relative flux ratio with time (four epochs spread over nearly three times\nthe time delay between the two lensed images) and frequency (between 350 and\n1050 GHz, rest-frame of the blazar), during the $\\gamma$-ray flare.

Multiple-scale solutions reveal that a\nperturbation to a slightly unstable uniform wavetrain of steepness \\mu slowly\nevolves according to a Nonlinear Schrodinger equation. In particular, for small\ncarrier wave steepness \\mu<\\mu_1~0.27 the perturbation dynamics is of focusing\ntype and the long-time behavior is characterized by Fermi-Pasta-Ulam\nrecurrence, the signature of breather interactions. However, the amplitude of\nbreathers and their likelihood of occurrence tend to diminish as \\mu increases\nwhile the Benjamin-Feir index decreases and becomes nil at \\mu1.

Alternatively, the tissue from the same individuals may be pooled\nprior to sequencing in what we refer to as a biologically averaged design. As\nmathematical averaging sequences all individuals it controls for both\nbiological and technical variation; however, is the statistical resolution\ngained always worth the additional cost? To compare biological and mathematical\naveraging, we examined theoretical and empirical estimates of statistical\nefficiency and relative cost efficiency. Though less efficient at a fixed\nsample size, we found that biological averaging can be more cost efficient than\nmathematical averaging. With this motivation, we developed a differential\nexpression classifier, ICRBC, that can detect alternatively expressed genes\nbetween biologically averaged samples. In simulation studies, we found that\nbiological averaging and subsequent analysis with our classifier performed\ncomparably to existing methods, such as ASC, edgeR, and DESeq, especially when\nindividuals were pooled evenly and less than 20% of the regulome was expected\nto be differentially regulated.

Second, in our\nD-dimensional spacetime (maybe D=4), classical defects of any possible\ncodimension should be compatible. These matching conditions fail to accept\ncodimension-2 and 3 defects for D=4 (which represents effectively the spacetime\nat certain length and energy scales) and most probably fail to accept high\nenough codimensional defects for any D since there is no high enough Lovelock\ndensity to support them. Here, we propose alternative matching conditions which\nseem to satisfy the previous criteria. Instead of varying the brane-bulk action\nwith respect to the bulk metric at the brane position, we vary with respect to\nthe brane embedding fields so that the gravitational back-reaction is included.\nFor a codimension-2 brane in 6-dim EGB gravity we prove its consistency for an\naxially symmetric cosmological configuration.

Our main conclusion is that by\ntargeting stars in the ecliptic it should be possible to perform high-quality\nasteroseismology, as long as favorable scenarios for 2-wheel pointing\nperformance are met. Targeting the ecliptic would potentially facilitate unique\nscience that was not possible in the nominal Mission, notably from the study of\nclusters that are significantly brighter than those in the Kepler field. Our\nconclusions are based on predictions of 2-wheel observations made by a space\nphotometry simulator, with information provided by the Kepler Project used as\ninput to describe the degraded pointing scenarios. We find that elevated levels\nof frequency-dependent noise, consistent with the above scenarios, would have a\nsignificant negative impact on our ability to continue asteroseismic studies of\nsolar-like oscillators in the Kepler field. However, the situation may be much\nmore optimistic for observations in the ecliptic, provided that pointing resets\nof the spacecraft during regular desaturations of the two functioning reaction\nwheels are accurate at the < 1 arcsec level. This would make it possible to\napply a post-hoc analysis that would recover most of the lost photometric\nprecision. Without this post-hoc correction---and the accurate re-pointing it\nrequires---the performance would probably be as poor as in the Kepler-field\ncase. Critical to our conclusions for both fields is the assumed level of\npointing noise (in the short-term jitter and the longer-term drift). We suggest\nthat further tests will be needed to clarify our results once more detail and\ndata on the expected pointing performance becomes available, and we offer our\nassistance in this work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Sep 2013 14:38:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-04"}

For IR-NTC systems based on {\\em\nfinite-length} codes (with blocklength $N$) and decoding attempts only at {\\em\ncertain specified decoding times}, this paper presents the asymptotic expansion\nachieved by random coding, provides rate-compatible sphere-packing (RCSP)\nperformance approximations, and presents simulation results of tail-biting\nconvolutional codes.\n  The information-theoretic analysis shows that values of $N$ relatively close\nto the expected latency yield the same random-coding achievability expansion as\nwith $N = \\infty$. However, the penalty introduced in the expansion by limiting\ndecoding times is linear in the interval between decoding times. For binary\nsymmetric channels, the RCSP approximation provides an efficiently-computed\napproximation of performance that shows excellent agreement with a family of\nrate-compatible, tail-biting convolutional codes in the short-latency regime.\nFor the additive white Gaussian noise channel, bounded-distance decoding\nsimplifies the computation of the marginal RCSP approximation and produces\nsimilar results as analysis based on maximum-likelihood decoding for latencies\ngreater than 200. The efficiency of the marginal RCSP approximation facilitates\noptimization of the lengths of incremental transmissions when the number of\nincremental transmissions is constrained to be small or the length of the\nincremental transmissions is constrained to be uniform after the first\ntransmission. Finally, an RCSP-based decoding error trajectory is introduced\nthat provides target error rates for the design of rate-compatible code\nfamilies for use in feedback communication systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Sep 2013 14:45:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-04"}

Indeed, all observed couplings\nare consistent with the predictions from the Higgs mechanism, both to vector\nbosons and fermions implying that masses are indeed consistent of being\ngenerated by the interactions with the Higgs field. However, on a cosmological\nscale the mass of the universe seems not to be related to the Higgs field: the\nbaryonic mass originates from the binding energy of the quarks inside the\nnuclei and dark matter is not even predicted in the SM, so the origin of its\nmass is unknown. The dominant energy component in the universe, the dark\nenergy, yields an accelerated expansion of the universe, so its repulsive\ngravity most likely originates from a kind of vacuum energy.

Most of the discussion has focused on theoretical issues with the\nconsequence that operational prescriptions, which are integral to experimental\nphysics, have been largely ignored. This has undoubtedly exacerbated attempts\nto find a solution to the \"measurement problem\". In this paper, we fully\nembrace the ensemble interpretation of quantum mechanics that obviates the need\nto entertain reduction of the state vector, one of the primary dilemmas of the\nmeasurement problem. The other major aspect of the measurement problem, the\nnecessity of describing measurements in terms of classical concepts, remains.\nHowever, we argue that the ultimate interface with experiments is described by\noperational prescriptions and not in terms of the concepts of classical theory.\nThe pedestrian approach presented here suggests that the measurement problem\nis, in some sense, ill-posed and might never be resolved. This state of affairs\nis, in part, the result of searching for a theoretical answer to what is\nfundamentally an experimental question. This point of view is tenable so long\nas one is willing to view physical theories as providing models of nature\nrather than complete descriptions of reality. Among other things, these\nconsiderations lead us to suggest that the Copenhagen interpretation's\ninsistence on the classicality of the measurement apparatus should be replaced\nby the requirement that a measurement, which is specified operationally, should\nsimply be of sufficient precision.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Sep 2013 15:31:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-04"}

These objects feature characteristic\ninner cavities and/or gaps of a few tens of AUs in the sub-millimitre images of\nthe disc. This signature suggests a localised depletion of matter in the disc\nthat could be caused by planet formation processes. However, recent\nobservations have revealed differences in the structures imaged at different\nwavelengths in some of these discs. In this paper, we aim to explain these\nobservational differences using self-consistent physical 2-D hydrodynamical and\ndust evolution models of such objects, assuming their morphology is indeed\ngenerated by the presence of a planet. We use these models to derive the\ndistribution of gas and dust in a theoretical planet-hosting disc, for various\nplanet masses and orbital separations. We then simulate observations of the\nemitted and scattered light from these models with VLT/SPHERE ZIMPOL,\nSubaru/HiCIAO, VLT/VISIR and ALMA. We do this by first computing the full\nresolution images of the models at different wavelengths, and then simulating\nthe observations accounting for the characteristics of each particular\ninstrument. The presence of the planet generates pressure bumps in the gas\ndistribution of the disc whose characteristics strongly depend on the planet\nmass and position. These bumps cause large grains to accumulate while small\ngrains are allowed into inner regions. This spatial differentiation of the\ngrain sizes explains the differences in the observations since different\nwavelengths and observing techniques trace different parts of the dust size\ndistribution. Based on this effect, we conclude that the combination of\nvisible/near-infrared polarimetric and sub-mm images is the best strategy to\nconstrain the properties of the unseen planet responsible for the disc\nstructure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Sep 2013 09:25:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

The problem of single\nparticle reconstruction (SPR) from cryo-EM is to use the resulting set of noisy\n2D projection images taken at unknown directions to reconstruct the 3D\nstructure of the molecule. In some situations, the molecule under examination\nexhibits structural variability, which poses a fundamental challenge in SPR.\nThe heterogeneity problem is the task of mapping the space of conformational\nstates of a molecule. It has been previously suggested that the leading\neigenvectors of the covariance matrix of the 3D molecules can be used to solve\nthe heterogeneity problem. Estimating the covariance matrix is challenging,\nsince only projections of the molecules are observed, but not the molecules\nthemselves. In this paper, we formulate a general problem of covariance\nestimation from noisy projections of samples. This problem has intimate\nconnections with matrix completion problems and high-dimensional principal\ncomponent analysis. We propose an estimator and prove its consistency. When\nthere are finitely many heterogeneity classes, the spectrum of the estimated\ncovariance matrix reveals the number of classes. The estimator can be found as\nthe solution to a certain linear system. In the cryo-EM case, the linear\noperator to be inverted, which we term the projection covariance transform, is\nan important object in covariance estimation for tomographic problems involving\nstructural variation. Inverting it involves applying a filter akin to the ramp\nfilter in tomography. We design a basis in which this linear operator is sparse\nand thus can be tractably inverted despite its large size. We demonstrate via\nnumerical experiments on synthetic datasets the robustness of our algorithm to\nhigh levels of noise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Sep 2013 02:23:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 24 May 2014 00:34:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 12 Sep 2014 20:29:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-16"}
