To accomplish this feat, we present a new method\nfor spectroscopic bulge-disk decomposition, in which a long-slit spectrum is\ndecomposed into two one-dimensional spectra representing purely the bulge and\ndisk light. We present preliminary results from applying this method to\nlenticular galaxies in the Virgo and Fornax Clusters, in which we show that the\nmost recent star formation activity in these galaxies occurred within the\nbulges. We also find that the bulges are in general more Fe-enriched than the\ndisks of the same galaxy, and that this enrichment grows stronger as the age of\nthe bulge becomes younger.

This paper presents a\nnovel methodology to overcome routing misbehavior in MANET using Retaliation\nModel. In this model node misbehavior is watched and an equivalent misbehavior\nis given in return. This model employs several parameters such as number of\npackets forwarded, number of packets received for forwarding, packet forwarding\nratio etc. to calculate Grade and Bonus Points. The Grade is used to isolate\nselfish nodes from the routing paths and the Bonus Points defines the number of\npackets dropped by an honest node in retaliation over its misconducts. The\nimplementation is done in \"GloMoSim\" on top of the DSR protocol. We obtained up\nto 40% packet delivery ratio with a cost of a minimum of 7.5% overhead compared\nto DSR. To minimize total control traffic overhead we have included the FG\nModel with our model and it reduces the overhead up to 75%.

Reconnection between the two ejecta and between the ejecta and\nthe interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) determines the type of structure\nresulting from the interaction. When a CME with a high inclination with respect\nto the ecliptic overtakes one with a low inclination, it is possible to create\na compound event with a smooth rotation in the magnetic field vector over more\nthan 180 degrees.

We have studied theoretically the\ndynamics of a BEC after release from a toroidal trap potential by solving the\n3D Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equation. The trap and condensate characteristics\nmatched those of a recent experiment. The circulation, experimentally imparted\nto the condensate by stirring, was simulated theoretically by imprinting a\nlinear azimuthal phase on the initial condensate wave function. The theoretical\nTOF images were in good agreement with the experimental data. We find that upon\nrelease the dynamics of the ring--shaped condensate proceeds in two distinct\nphases. First, the condensate expands rapidly inward, filling in the initial\nhole until it reaches a minimum radius that depends on the initial circulation.\nIn the second phase, the density at the inner radius increases to a maximum\nafter which the hole radius begins slowly to expand. During this second phase a\nseries of concentric rings appears due to the interference of ingoing and\noutgoing matter waves from the inner radius. The results of the GP equation\npredict that the hole area is a quadratic function of the initial circulation\nwhen the condensate is released directly from the trap in which it was stirred\nand is a linear function of the circulation if the trap is relaxed before\nrelease. These scalings matched the data. Thus, hole size after TOF can be used\nas a reliable probe of initial condensate circulation. This connection between\ncirculation and hole size after TOF will facilitate future studies of\natomtronic systems that are implemented in ultracold quantum gases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Sep 2013 18:46:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

In this contribution, we discuss the possibility of identifying and\nstudying such `resolved' binaries through their electromagnetic emission. The\nhost galaxies of such binaries are themselves expected to be also very massive\nand rare, so that out to redshifts z~2 a unique massive galaxy may be\nidentified as the host. At higher redshifts, the PTA error boxes are larger and\nmay contain as many as several hundred massive-galaxy interlopers. In this\ncase, the true counterpart may be identified, if it is accreting gas\nefficiently, as an active galactic nucleus (AGN) with a peculiar spectrum and\nvariable emission features. Specifically, the binary's tidal torques expel the\ngas from the inner part of the accretion disk, making it unusually dim in X-ray\nand UV bands and in broad optical emission lines. The tails of the broad wings\nof any FeK-alpha emission line may also be `clipped' and missing. The binary's\norbital motion, as well as the gas motions it induces, may trigger\nquasiperiodic variations. These include coherent flux variability, such as\nluminous, multi-wavelength flares, as well as Doppler shifts of broad emission\nlines and `see-saw' oscillations in the FeK-alpha line.

The formalism provided similar physics to\ndynamical mean-field theory at a tiny fraction of the cost, but was inherently\nlimited by the construction of a bath designed to reproduce ground state,\nstatic properties. Here, we generalize the concept of quantum embedding to\ndynamic properties and demonstrate accurate bulk spectral functions at\nsimilarly small computational cost. The proposed spectral DMET utilizes the\nSchmidt decomposition of a response vector, mapping the bulk dynamic\ncorrelation functions to that of a quantum impurity cluster coupled to a set of\nfrequency dependent bath states. The resultant spectral functions are obtained\non the real-frequency axis, without bath discretization error, and allows for\nthe construction of arbitrary dynamic correlation functions. We demonstrate the\nmethod on the 1D and 2D Hubbard model, where we obtain zero temperature,\nthermodynamic limit spectral functions, and show the trivial extension to\ntwo-particle Green functions. This advance therefore extends the scope and\napplicability of DMET in condensed matter problems as a computationally\ntractable route to correlated spectral functions of extended systems, and\nprovides a competitive alternative to dynamical mean-field theory for dynamic\nquantities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Sep 2013 20:45:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 Feb 2015 21:51:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

However, the PGAS rich\nmemory model comes at a performance cost which can hinder its potential for\nscalability and performance. To contain this overhead and achieve full\nperformance, compiler optimizations may not be sufficient and manual\noptimizations are typically added. This, however, can severely limit the\nproductivity advantage. Such optimizations are usually targeted at reducing\naddress translation overheads for shared data structures. This paper proposes a\nhardware architectural support for PGAS, which allows the processor to\nefficiently handle shared addresses. This eliminates the need for such\nhand-tuning, while maintaining the performance and productivity of PGAS\nlanguages.

The proposed method is\nexplained here with respect to four important issues: how secret shares are\ndistributed, how local neighbours are discovered, how legitimate third parties\nare verified, and how secure channels are established. Moreover, the\nperformance of the scheme is analyzed with regards to five metrics: local\nconnectivity, resistance to node capture, memory usage, communication overhead,\nand computational burden. Our scheme not only secures the transmission channels\nof nodes but also guarantees high local connectivity of the sensor network, low\nusage of memory resources, perfect network resilience against node capture, and\ncomplete prevention against impersonation attacks.

A detailed, more\ntechnical comparison between nominal typing and structural typing in OOP is\npresented in other publications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Sep 2013 00:10:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 29 Jun 2014 11:08:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 29 Dec 2017 17:34:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-01"}

The convergence rate is improved from O(1/k^{1/2}) to O(1/k) in\ngeneral, and when the sum is strongly-convex the convergence rate is improved\nfrom the sub-linear O(1/k) to a linear convergence rate of the form O(p^k) for\np \\textless{} 1. Further, in many cases the convergence rate of the new method\nis also faster than black-box deterministic gradient methods, in terms of the\nnumber of gradient evaluations. Numerical experiments indicate that the new\nalgorithm often dramatically outperforms existing SG and deterministic gradient\nmethods, and that the performance may be further improved through the use of\nnon-uniform sampling strategies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Sep 2013 06:49:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 May 2016 06:51:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-12"}

Indeed, properties of\nLorenz's fractal invariant set relate space-time calculus to deep areas of\nmathematics such as G\\\"{o}del's Incompleteness Theorem. These properties,\ncombined with some recent developments in theoretical and observational\ncosmology, motivate what is referred to as the `cosmological invariant set\npostulate': that the universe $U$ can be considered a deterministic dynamical\nsystem evolving on a causal measure-zero fractal invariant set $I_U$ in its\nstate space. Symbolic representations of $I_U$ are constructed explicitly based\non permutation representations of quaternions. The resulting `invariant set\ntheory' provides some new perspectives on determinism and causality in\nfundamental physics. For example, whilst the cosmological invariant set appears\nto have a rich enough structure to allow a description of quantum probability,\nits measure-zero character ensures it is sparse enough to prevent invariant set\ntheory being constrained by the Bell inequality (consistent with a partial\nviolation of the so-called measurement independence postulate). The primacy of\ngeometry as embodied in the proposed theory extends the principles underpinning\ngeneral relativity. As a result, the physical basis for contemporary programmes\nwhich apply standard field quantisation to some putative gravitational\nlagrangian is questioned. Consistent with Penrose's suggestion of a\ndeterministic but non-computable theory of fundamental physics, a\n`gravitational theory of the quantum' is proposed based on the geometry of\n$I_U$, with potential observational consequences for the dark universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Sep 2013 07:32:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 25 Mar 2014 08:17:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

Owing to the entropy dependence of the Mn yield in explosive\nthermonuclear burning, SNe Ia involving near Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarfs\n(WDs) are predicted to produce Mn to Fe ratios significantly exceeding those of\nSN Ia explosions involving sub-Chandrasekhar mass primary WDs. Of all current\nsupernova explosion models, only SN Ia models involving near-Chandrasekhar mass\nWDs produce [Mn/Fe] > 0.0. Aims: Using the specific yields for competing SN Ia\nscenarios, we aim to constrain the relative fractions of exploding\nnear-Chandrasekhar mass to sub-Chandrasekhar mass primary WDs in the Galaxy.\nMethods: We extract the Mn yields from three-dimensional thermonuclear\nsupernova simulations referring to different initial setups and progenitor\nchannels. We then compute the chemical evolution of Mn in the Solar\nneighborhood, assuming SNe Ia are made up of different relative fractions of\nthe considered explosion models. Results: We find that due to the entropy\ndependence of freeze-out yields from nuclear statistical equilibrium, [Mn/Fe]\nstrongly depends on the mass of the exploding WD, with near-Chandraskher mass\nWDs producing substantially higher [Mn/Fe] than sub-Chandrasekhar mass WDs. Of\nall nucleosynthetic sources potentially influencing the chemical evolution of\nMn, only explosion models involving the thermonuclear incineration of\nnear-Chandrasekhar mass WDs predict solar or super-solar [Mn/Fe].

Methods. Our\nalgorithm has been tested by means of simulated Gaia spectrophotometry, which\nis based on SDSS observations and theoretical spectral libraries covering a\nwide sample of astronomical objects.

The physical\nquantities are derived by fitting the hyperfine structure of N$_2$H$^+$. The\nHerschel and 1.1-mm continuum maps show that a pc-scale filament fragments into\nthree clumps with radii of $0.1-0.2$ pc and masses of $40-230M_\\odot$. We find\nthat the clumps contain smaller-scale ($\\sim 0.04$ pc) structures, i.e., dense\ncores. We identify 70 cores by applying CLUMPFIND to the N$_2$H$^+$ data cube.\nIn the central cluster-forming clump, the excitation temperature and line-width\ntend to be large, presumably due to protostellar outflow feedback and stellar\nradiation. However, for all the clumps, the virial ratios are evaluated to be\n$0.1-0.3$, indicating that the internal motions play only a minor role in the\nclump support. The clumps exhibit no free-fall, but low-velocity infall, and\nthus the clumps should be supported by additional forces. The most promising\nforce is the globally-ordered magnetic field observed toward this region. We\npropose that the Serpens South filament was close to magnetically-critical and\nambipolar diffusion triggered the cluster formation. We find that the northern\nclump, which shows no active star formation, has a mass and radius comparable\nto the central cluster-forming clump, and therefore, it is a likely candidate\nof a {\\it pre-protocluster clump}. The initial condition for cluster formation\nis likely to be a magnetically-supported clump of cold, quiescent gas. This\nappears to contradict the accretion-driven turbulence scenario, for which the\nturbulence in the clumps is maintained by the accretion flow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Sep 2013 09:20:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

The crucial\nquestion for ensuring a balance between the supply and demand-side of data, is\nwhether this trend connects to existing scholarly practices and to the average\nsearch skills of researchers. To gain insight into this process we conducted a\nsurvey among nearly three hundred (N= 288) humanities scholars in the\nNetherlands and Belgium with the aim of finding answers to the following\nquestions: 1) To what extent are digital databases and archives used? 2) What\nare the preferences in search functionalities 3) Are there differences in\nsearch strategies between novices and experts of information retrieval? Our\nresults show that while scholars actively engage in research online they mainly\nsearch for text and images. General search systems such as Google and JSTOR are\npredominant, while large-scale collections such as Europeana are rarely\nconsulted. Searching with keywords is the dominant search strategy and advanced\nsearch options are rarely used. When comparing novice and more experienced\nsearchers, the first tend to have a more narrow selection of search engines,\nand mostly use keywords. Our overall findings indicate that Google is the key\nplayer among available search engines. This dominant use illustrates the\nparadoxical attitude of scholars toward Google: while provenance and context\nare deemed key academic requirements, the workings of the Google algorithm\nremain unclear. We conclude that Google introduces a black box into digital\nscholarly practices, indicating scholars will become increasingly dependent on\nsuch black boxed algorithms. This calls for a reconsideration of the academic\nprinciples of provenance and context.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Sep 2013 09:52:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 Nov 2013 11:20:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 22 Apr 2014 13:50:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-23"}

We find different behaviours for gas and star particles.\nGas within corotation is driven in the central regions by the bar, where it\nforms a pseudo-bulge (disky-bulge), but it undergoes negligible radial\ndisplacement outside the bar region. Stars undergo substantial radial migration\nat all times, caused first by transient spiral arms and later by the bar.\nDespite the important amount of radial migration occurring in our model, its\nimpact on the chemical properties is limited. The reason is the relatively flat\nabundance profile, due to the rapid early evolution of the whole disk. We show\nthat the implications of radial migration on chemical evolution can be studied\nto a good accuracy by post-processing the results of the N-body+SPH calculation\nwith a simple chemical evolution model having detailed chemistry and a\nparametrized description of radial migration. We find that radial migration\nimpacts on chemical evolution both directly (by moving around the long-lived\nagents of nucleosynthesis, like e.g. SNIa or AGB stars, and thus altering the\nabundance profiles of the gas) and indirectly (by moving around the long-lived\ntracers of chemical evolution and thus affecting stellar metallicity profiles,\nlocal age-metallicity relations and metallicity distributions of stars, etc.).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Sep 2013 10:03:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-11"}

In paper I \\citep{Yang2011},\nwe proposed a minimal variance estimator to overcome this problem. By utilizing\nthe different dependences of cosmic magnification and galaxy intrinsic\nclustering on galaxy flux, we demonstrated that the otherwise overwhelming\ngalaxy intrinsic clustering can be significantly suppressed such that lensing\nmaps can be reconstructed with promising accuracy. This procedure relies\nheavily on the accuracy of determining the galaxy bias from the same data.\nPaper I adopts an iterative approach, which degrades toward high redshift. The\ncurrent paper presents an alternative method, improving over paper I. We prove\nthat the measured galaxy clustering between flux bins allows for simultaneous\ndetermination of the lensing power spectrum and the flux dependence of galaxy\nbias, at this redshift bin. Comparing to paper I, the new approach is not only\nmore straightforward, but also more robust. It identifies an ambiguity in\ndetermining the galaxy bias and further discovers a mathematically robust way\nto suppress this ambiguity to non-negligible level ($\\sim 0.1%$). The\naccurately determined galaxy bias can then be applied to the minimal variance\nestimator proposed in paper I to improve the lensing map-making. The gain at\nhigh redshift is significant. These maps can be used to measure other\nstatistics, such as cluster finding and peak statistics. Furthermore, by\nincluding galaxy clustering measurement between different redshift bins, we can\nalso determine the lensing cross power spectrum between these bins, up to a\nsmall and correctable multiplicative factor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Sep 2013 12:18:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-21"}

In a case of bright sources, the line centroid energy is\nanti-correlated with the luminosity. Such a behaviour is often associated with\nthe onset and growth of the accretion column, which is believed to be the\norigin of the observed emission and the cyclotron lines. However, this scenario\ninevitably implies large gradient of the magnetic field strength within the\nline-forming region, and it makes the formation of the observed line-like\nfeatures problematic. Moreover, the observed variation of the cyclotron line\nenergy is much smaller than could be anticipated for the corresponding\nluminosity changes. We argue that a more physically realistic situation is that\nthe cyclotron line forms when the radiation emitted by the accretion column is\nreflected from the neutron star surface. The idea is based on the facts that a\nsubstantial part of column luminosity is intercepted by the neutron star\nsurface and the reflected radiation should contain absorption features. The\nreflection model is developed and applied to explain the observed variations of\nthe cyclotron line energy in a bright X-ray pulsar V 0332+53 over a wide range\nof luminosities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Sep 2013 14:14:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

This auction format has recently attracted much\nattention, with previous work establishing positive results for unit-demand\nvaluations and negative results for submodular valuations. This leaves a large\ngap in our understanding between these valuation classes. In this work we\nresolve this gap on the negative side. In particular, we show that even in the\nvery restricted case in which each bidder has either an additive valuation or a\nunit-demand valuation, there exist instances in which the inefficiency at\nequilibrium grows linearly with the minimum of the number of items and the\nnumber of bidders. Moreover, these inefficient equilibria persist even under\niterated elimination of weakly dominated strategies. Our main result implies\nlinear inefficiency for many natural settings, including auctions with gross\nsubstitute valuations, capacitated valuations, budget-additive valuations, and\nadditive valuations with hard budget constraints on the payments. Another\nimplication is that the inefficiency in sequential auctions is driven by the\nmaximum number of items contained in any player's optimal set, and this is\ntight. For capacitated valuations, our results imply a lower bound that equals\nthe maximum capacity of any bidder, which is tight following the upper-bound\ntechnique established by Paes Leme et al. \\cite{PaesLeme2012}.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Sep 2013 14:39:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-11"}

Finally, the uncertainty\nin the starting time $t_0$ of a classical glitch causes uncertainties to some\nglitch parameters, but less so to a slow glitch and $t_0$ of which can be\ndetermined from data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Sep 2013 14:54:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-12"}

The frequency\nrange 310-376 MHz was covered by 1024 channels which allowed the application of\nRM synthesis. We derived a data cube in Faraday depth and compared two\nsymmetric ranges of negative and positive Faraday depths.

For the first time, diffuse polarized\nemission from a nearby galaxy is detected below 1 GHz. The degree of\npolarization is only 0.21 +/- 0.05 %, consistent with extrapolation of internal\ndepolarization from data at higher radio frequency. A catalogue of 33 polarized\nsources and their Faraday rotation in the M31 field is presented. Their average\ndepolarization is DP(90,20) = 0.14 +/- 0.02, 7 times stronger depolarized than\nat 1.4 GHz. We argue that this strong depolarization originates within the\nsources, e.g. in their radio lobes, or in intervening galaxies on the line of\nsight.

The unique characteristics of LTEs modulation\nand UL resource assignment poses considerable challenges in achieving this goal\nbecause most LTE deployments have 1:1 frequency re-use, and the uplink\ninterference can vary considerably across successive time slots. In this work,\nwe propose LeAP, a measurement data driven machine learning paradigm for power\ncontrol to manage up-link interference in LTE. The data driven approach has the\ninherent advantage that the solution adapts based on network traffic,\npropagation and network topology, that is increasingly heterogeneous with\nmultiple cell-overlays. LeAP system design consists of the following\ncomponents: (i) design of user equipment (UE) measurement statistics that are\nsuccinct, yet expressive enough to capture the network dynamics, and (ii)\ndesign of two learning based algorithms that use the reported measurements to\nset the power control parameters and optimize the network performance. LeAP is\nstandards compliant and can be implemented in centralized SON (self organized\nnetworking) server resource (cloud). We perform extensive evaluations using\nradio network plans from real LTE network operational in a major metro area in\nUnited States.

By viewing the special functions in this way, it is possible to\nderive many of their properties that were originally discovered using classical\nanalysis, such as generating functions, differential relations, and recursion\nrelations. This relationship is of interest to physicists due to the fact that\nmany of the common special functions, such as Hermite polynomials and Bessel\nfunctions, are related to remarkably simple Lie groups used in physics.\nUnfortunately, much of the literature on this subject remains inaccessible to\nundergraduate students.

For positive strangeness components the link between CSA and QM\nrequires strong dependence of the effective $\\bar{s}$ mass on particular SU(3)\nmultiplet. The SU(3) configuration mixing is important, it pushes the spectrum\ntowards the simplistic model (with equal masses of the strange quark and\nantiquark), and explanation of this nice property is lacking still. The success\nof the CSA in describing many properties of baryons and light nuclei\n(hypernuclei) means that predictions of pentaquark states should be considered\nseriously. Existence of PQ by itself is without any doubt, although very narrow\nPQ may not exist. Wide, even very wide PQ should exist, therefore, searches for\nPQ remain to be an actual task.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Sep 2013 15:52:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-11"}
