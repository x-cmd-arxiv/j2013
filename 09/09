The global extension\nproblem asks for the classification of all Poisson algebra structures that can\nbe defined on $E$ such that $\\pi : E \\to P$ becomes a morphism of Poisson\nalgebras. From a geometrical point of view it means to decompose this groupoid\ninto connected components and to indicate a point in each such component. All\nsuch Poisson algebra structures on $E$ are classified by an explicitly\nconstructed classifying set ${\\mathcal G} {\\mathcal P} {\\mathcal H}^{2} \\, (P,\n\\, V)$ which is the coproduct of all non-abelian cohomological objects\n${\\mathcal P} {\\mathcal H}^{2} \\, (P, \\, (V, \\cdot_V, [-,-]_V))$ which are the\nclassifying sets for all extensions of $P$ by $(V, \\cdot_V, [-,-]_V)$.

More recently, an upper limit of <9% on the aliphatic fraction\n(i.e., the fraction of carbon atoms in aliphatic form) of the UIE carriers\nbased on the observed intensities of the 3.4 and 3.3 micrometer emission\nfeatures by attributing them to aliphatic and aromatic C-H stretching modes,\nrespectively, and assuming A_34./A_3.3~0.68 derived from a small set of\naliphatic and aromatic compounds, where A_3.4 and A_3.3 are respectively the\nband strengths of the 3.4 micrometer aliphatic and 3.3 micrometer aromatic C-H\nbonds.\n  To improve the estimate of the aliphatic fraction of the UIE carriers, here\nwe analyze 35 UIE sources which exhibit both the 3.3 and 3.4 micrometer C-H\nfeatures and determine I_3.4/I_3.3, the ratio of the power emitted from the 3.4\nmicrometer feature to that from the 3.3 micrometer feature.

The nature of its carrier remains unknown since the first\ndetection of the 21 micrometer feature in 1989. Over a dozen materials have\nbeen suggested as possible carrier candidates. However, none of them has been\naccepted: they either require too much material (compared to what is available\nin the circumstellar shells around these post-AGB stars), or exhibit additional\nemission features which are not seen in these 21 micrometer sources.\n  Recently, iron monoxide (FeO) nanoparticles seem to be a promising carrier\ncandidate as Fe is an abundant element and FeO emits exclusively at ~21\nmicrometer. In this work, using the proto-typical protoplanetary nebula HD\n56126 as a test case, we examine FeO nanoparticles as a carrier for the 21\nmicrometer feature by modeling their infrared emission, with FeO being\nstochastically heated by single stellar photons. We find that FeO emits too\nbroad a 21 micrometer feature to explain the observed one and the Fe abundance\nrequired to be locked up in FeO exceeds what is available in HD 56126.

Precise stellar parameters are crucial in exoplanet research for\ncorrectly determining of the planetary parameters.

Different methods can provide different results, which leads to\ndifferent planet characteristics.}%Spectroscopic surface gravities have shown\nto be poorly constrained, but the photometry of the transiting planet can\nprovide an independent measurement of the surface gravity.\n  Aims. In this paper, we use a uniform method to spectroscopically derive\nstellar atmospheric parameters, chemical abundances, stellar masses, and\nstellar radii for a sample of 90 transit hosts. Surface gravities are also\nderived photometrically using the stellar density as derived from the light\ncurve. We study the effect of using these different surface gravities on the\ndetermination of the chemical abundances and the stellar mass and radius.\n  Methods. A spectroscopic analysis based on Kurucz models in LTE was performed\nthrough the MOOG code to derive the atmospheric parameters and the chemical\nabundances. The photometric surface gravity was determined through isochrone\nfitting and the use of the stellar density, directly determined from the light\ncurve. Stellar masses and radii are determined through calibration formulae.\n  Results. Spectroscopic and photometric surface gravities differ, but this has\nvery little effect on the precise determination of the stellar mass in our\nspectroscopic analysis. The stellar radius, and hence the planetary radius, is\nmost affected by the surface gravity discrepancies. For the chemical\nabundances, the difference is, as expected, only noticable for the abundances\nderived from analyzing of lines of ionized species.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Sep 2013 19:32:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

In particular, N(D(a,b)))=ab+a+b+1 if a is not equal to b,\nand N(D(a,a)))=(1/2) (a^2+3a+2) otherwise. This formula is then extended to\nfive additional types of pseudograph by application of a theorem that states\nN(G) is preserved between two graph types if edge adjacencies and automorphisms\nare preserved, and provided that any two networks are members of the same\nisotemporal class if and only if they are isomorphic by transpositions of\nsequential edge labels on non-adjacent edges.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Sep 2013 20:05:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-10"}

The notion of complementarity is closely related to Heisenberg's\nuncertainty principle, but the exact relation between the two remains a source\nof debate. For example, knowledge of a particle's position in a double slit\ninterference experiment will quench its wave-like nature and, vice versa,\nobserving the wave property via interference implies lack of knowledge of the\nparticle's path. A canonical system for exploring complementarity is the\nquantum eraser (QE), predominantly studied thus far in photonic systems. A QE\nis an interference experiment consisting of two stages. First, one of the\ninterfering paths is coupled to a 'which path' (WP) detector - demonstrating\nloss of interference due to acquisition of WP information. Second, the WP\ninformation is being 'erased' by projecting the detector's wavefunction on a\nparticular basis; this renders the WP information inaccessible, thus allowing\nreconstruction of the interference pattern. In this work, we present a first\nimplementation of a QE in an electronic system.

Based on these structures we introduce the Liouville vector field L and\na suitable Hamiltonian function H on TM. The Liouville vector field turns out\nto be the Hamiltonian vector field associated to H. On the other hand, H also\ndefines the mass shells as Lorentzian submanifolds of the tangent bundle. A\nsimple collisionless gas is described by a distribution function on a\nparticular mass shell, satisfying the Liouville equation. Together with the\nLiouville vector field the distribution function can be thought of as defining\na fictitious incompressible fluid on the mass shells, with associated conserved\ncurrent density. Flux integrals of this current density provide the averaged\nproperties of the gas, while suitable fibre integrals of the distribution\nfunction define divergence-free tensor fields on the spacetime manifold such as\nthe current density and stress-energy tensor. Finally, we discuss the\nrelationship between symmetries of the spacetime manifold and symmetries of the\ndistribution function.\n  As a first application of our formalism we derive the most general\nspherically symmetric distribution function on any spherically symmetric\nspacetime and write the Einstein-Liouville equations as effective field\nequations on the two-dimensional radial manifold.

Acceleration efficiency is\nincreased by entrapment through self-generated waves, which is highly dependent\non the amount of accelerated particles. This, in turn, is determined by the\nefficiency of particle injection into the acceleration process.\n  Aims: We present an analysis of the injection efficiency at coronal shocks of\nvarying obliquity. We assessed injection through reflection and downstream\nscattering, including the effect of a cross-shock potential. Both quasi-thermal\nand suprathermal seed populations were analysed. We present results on the\neffect of cross-field diffusion downstream of the shock on the injection\nefficiency.\n  Methods: Using analytical methods, we present applicable injection speed\nthresholds that were compared with both semi-analytical flux integration and\nMonte Carlo simulations, which do not resort to binary thresholds. Shock-normal\nangle and shock-normal velocity were varied to assess the injection efficiency\nwith respect to these parameters.\n  Results: We present evidence of a significant bias of thermal seed particle\ninjection at small shock-normal angles. We show that downstream isotropisation\nmethods affect the theta-dependence of this result. We show a non-negligible\neffect caused by the cross-shock potential, and that the effect of downstream\ncross-field diffusion is highly dependent on boundary definitions.\n  Conclusions: Our results show that for Monte Carlo simulations of coronal\nshock acceleration a full distribution function assessment with downstream\nisotropisation through scatterings is necessary to realistically model particle\ninjection. Based on our results, seed particle injection at quasi-parallel\ncoronal shocks can result in significant acceleration efficiency, especially\nwhen combined with varying field-line geometry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Sep 2013 07:58:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-10"}

Many high-dimensional data, such as face\nimages and motion sequences, approximately lie in a union of low-dimensional\nsubspaces. The corresponding subspace clustering problem has been extensively\nstudied in the literature to partition such high-dimensional data into clusters\ncorresponding to their underlying low-dimensional subspaces. However,\nlow-dimensional intrinsic structures are often violated for real-world\nobservations, as they can be corrupted by errors or deviate from ideal models.\nWe propose to address this by learning a linear transformation on subspaces\nusing matrix rank, via its convex surrogate nuclear norm, as the optimization\ncriteria. The learned linear transformation restores a low-rank structure for\ndata from the same subspace, and, at the same time, forces a a maximally\nseparated structure for data from different subspaces. In this way, we reduce\nvariations within subspaces, and increase separation between subspaces for a\nmore robust subspace clustering. This proposed learned robust subspace\nclustering framework significantly enhances the performance of existing\nsubspace clustering methods. Basic theoretical results here presented help to\nfurther support the underlying framework. To exploit the low-rank structures of\nthe transformed subspaces, we further introduce a fast subspace clustering\ntechnique, which efficiently combines robust PCA with sparse modeling. When\nclass labels are present at the training stage, we show this low-rank\ntransformation framework also significantly enhances classification\nperformance.

This new platform presents a flexible\narchitecture that enables fast/automatic system adaptive behaviour without\nhuman intervention. The concept is based on contactless technology, using\nartificial vision and laser scanning to identify and characterize different\nworkpieces travelling on a conveyor. Using laser triangulation, the workpieces\nare virtually reconstructed through a simplified cloud of three-dimensional\n(3D) points. From those reconstructed models, several algorithms are\nimplemented to extract information about workpieces profile (pattern\nrecognition), size, boundary and pose. Such information is then used to on-line\nadjust the base robot programmes.

This is a low-cost and fully autonomous system\nthat allows adapting the robots behaviour to different manufacturing\nsituations.

No skilled workers and large setup times are needed to\noperate it.

The couplings of the TC Higgs to SM\nfermions are due to interactions beyond TC, such as Extended Technicolor: if\nsuch interactions successfully generate mass for the SM fermions, we argue that\nthe couplings of the latter to the TC Higgs are also SM-like.\n  We suggest a generic parameterization of the TC Higgs interactions with SM\nparticles that accommodates a large class of TC models, and we perform a fit of\nthese parameters to the Higgs LHC data. The fit reveals regions of parameter\nspace where the form factors are of order unity and consistent with data at the\n95% CL, in agreement with expectations in TC theories. This indicates that the\ndiscovered Higgs boson is consistent with the TC Higgs hypothesis for several\nTC theories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Sep 2013 10:23:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

Particularly, the 2DEG at the interface\nbetween two perovskite insulators represented by the formula of ABO3, such as\nLaAlO3 and SrTiO3, has attracted significant attention. In recent years,\nprogresses have been made to decipher the puzzle of the origin of interface\nconduction, to design new types of oxide interfaces, and to improve the\ninterfacial carrier mobility significantly. These achievements open the door to\nexplore fundamental as well as applied physics of complex oxides. Here, we\nreview our recent experimental work on metallic and insulating interfaces\ncontrolled by interfacial redox reactions in SrTiO3-based heterostructures. Due\nto the presence of oxygen-vacancies at the SrTiO3 surface, metallic conduction\ncan be created at room temperature in perovskite-type interfaces when the\noverlayer oxide ABO3 involves Al, Ti, Zr, or Hf elements at the B-sites.\nFurthermore, relying on interface-stabilized oxygen vacancies, we have created\na new type of 2DEG at the heterointerface between SrTiO3 and a spinel\n{\\gamma}-Al2O3 epitaxial film with compatible oxygen ions sublattices. The\nspinel/perovskite oxide 2DEG exhibits an electron mobility exceeding 100,000\ncm2V-1s-1, more than one order of magnitude higher than those of hitherto\ninvestigated perovskite-type interfaces.

This flattening of the distribution\ncontrasts with a large body of empirical literature which finds a Pareto\ndistribution for firm sizes both across countries and over time. Pareto\ndistributions are generally traced back to a mechanism of proportional random\ngrowth, based on a regime of constant returns to scale. This makes our findings\nof an ``interrupted'' Pareto distribution all the more puzzling, because we\nprovide evidence that financial firms in our sample should operate in such a\nregime. We claim that the missing mass from the upper tail of the asset size\ndistribution is a consequence of shadow banking activity and that it provides\nan (upper) estimate of the size of the shadow banking system.

The J=16-15 line profile is broader than that of the J=10-9\nline, which in turn is broader than those of lower J transitions (6-5, 3-2,\nobserved with APEX), thus showing a clear temperature gradient of the gas with\nradius. A power-law flat disk model is used to fit the CO line profiles and the\nCO rotational ladder simultaneously, yielding a temperature of T_0=1100 \\pm 350\nK (at r_0 = 13 AU) and an index of q=0.85 \\pm 0.1 for the temperature radial\ngradient.

This arrangement creates\nturbulence at high Reynolds number with low mean flow. Most importantly, it\nexhibits a region of 3D homogeneous isotropic turbulence that is significantly\nlarger than the integral lengthscale. These features are essential for enabling\nlaboratory measurements of turbulent suspensions. We use quantitative imaging\nto confirm isotropy at large, small, and intermediate scales by examining one--\nand two--point statistics at the tank center. We then repeat these same\nmeasurements to confirm that the values measured at the tank center are\nconstant over a large homogeneous region. In the direction normal to the\nsymmetry plane, our measurements demonstrate that the homogeneous region\nextends for at least twice the integral length scale $L=9.5$ cm. In the\ndirections parallel to the symmetry plane, the region is at least four times\nthe integral lengthscale, and the extent in this direction is limited only by\nthe size of the tank.

The use of a sequence of Pade approximants known to converge to the true\nvacuum polarization appears to represent a more promising approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Sep 2013 13:33:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-16"}

Its main objective is to take a census of\nthe stellar content of our Galaxy, with the goal of revealing its formation and\nevolution. Gaia's unique feature is the measurement of parallaxes and proper\nmotions with hitherto unparalleled accuracy for many objects.

Multiple methods are used for\nmany types of stars, producing multiple results for the end user according to\ndifferent models and assumptions. Prior to its application to real Gaia data\nthe accuracy of these methods cannot be assessed definitively. But as an\nexample of the current performance, we can attain internal accuracies (RMS\nresiduals) on F,G,K,M dwarfs and giants at G=15 (V=15-17) for a wide range of\nmetallicites and interstellar extinctions of around 100K in effective\ntemperature (Teff), 0.1mag in extinction (A0), 0.2dex in metallicity ([Fe/H]),\nand 0.25dex in surface gravity (logg). The accuracy is a strong function of the\nparameters themselves, varying by a factor of more than two up or down over\nthis parameter range.

This highly anisotropic\ningredient of the interstellar material further complicates the difficult\nproblem of the systematic detection and measurement of dense cores in the\nstrongly variable but (relatively) isotropic backgrounds. Observational\nevidence that stars form in dense filaments creates severe problems for\nautomated source extraction methods that must reliably distinguish sources not\nonly from fluctuating backgrounds and noise, but also from the filamentary\nstructures. A previous paper presented the multi-scale, multi-wavelength source\nextraction method getsources based on a fine spatial scale decomposition and\nfiltering of irrelevant scales from images. In this paper, a multi-scale,\nmulti-wavelength filament extraction method getfilaments is presented that\nsolves this problem, substantially improving the robustness of source\nextraction with getsources in filamentary backgrounds.

Nevertheless, such extreme activity fluctuations and the dynamics of the\nsolar cycle during Maunder minima-like episodes remain ill-understood. We\nexplore the origin of such extreme solar activity fluctuations and the role of\ndual poloidal field sources, namely the Babcock-Leighton mechanism and the\nmean-field alpha effect in the dynamics of the solar cycle. We mainly\nconcentrate on entry and recovery from grand minima episodes such as the\nMaunder minimum and the dynamics of the solar cycle. We use a kinematic solar\ndynamo model with a novel set-up in which stochastic perturbations force two\ndistinct poloidal field alpha effects. We explore different regimes of\noperation of these poloidal sources with distinct operating thresholds, to\nidentify the importance of each. The perturbations are implemented\nindependently in both hemispheres which allows one to study the level of\nhemispheric coupling and hemispheric asymmetry in the emergence of sunspots.\nFrom the simulations performed we identify a few different ways in which the\ndynamo can enter a grand minima episode. While fluctuations in any of the\n$\\alpha$ effects can trigger intermittency we find that the mean-field alpha\neffect is crucial for the recovery of the solar cycle from a grand minima\nepisode which a Babcock-Leighton source alone, fails to achieve. Our\nsimulations also demonstrate other cycle dynamics. We conclude that stochastic\nfluctuations in two interacting poloidal field sources working with distinct\noperating thresholds is a viable candidate for triggering episodes of extreme\nsolar activity and that the mean-field alpha effect capable of working on weak,\nsub-equipartition fields is critical to the recovery of the solar cycle\nfollowing an extended solar minimum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Sep 2013 15:14:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Dec 2013 10:09:42 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 26 Dec 2013 11:27:44 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 29 Mar 2018 11:18:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-30"}

Groups are created explicitly\nby members of the community, but also form organically as members interact. Due\nto their importance, they have been studied widely (e.g., community detection,\nevolution, activity, etc.). One of the key questions for understanding how such\ngroups evolve is whether there are different types of groups and how they\ndiffer. In Sociology, theories have been proposed to help explain how such\ngroups form. In particular, the common identity and common bond theory states\nthat people join groups based on identity (i.e., interest in the topics\ndiscussed) or bond attachment (i.e., social relationships). The theory has been\napplied qualitatively to small groups to classify them as either topical or\nsocial. We use the identity and bond theory to define a set of features to\nclassify groups into those two categories. Using a dataset from Flickr, we\nextract user-defined groups and automatically-detected groups, obtained from a\ncommunity detection algorithm. We discuss the process of manual labeling of\ngroups into social or topical and present results of predicting the group label\nbased on the defined features. We directly validate the predictions of the\ntheory showing that the metrics are able to forecast the group type with high\naccuracy. In addition, we present a comparison between declared and detected\ngroups along topicality and sociality dimensions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Sep 2013 15:47:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-10"}

Here, we calculate the\ndominant shift of the molar polarizability in an atomic gas due to thermal\neffects.

At each time instant, a node is\nrandomly selected to interact with a random neighbor. Depending on if the link\nbetween the two nodes belongs to a given subgraph of attractive or repulsive\nlinks, the node update follows a standard attractive weighted average or a\nrepulsive weighted average, respectively. The repulsive update has the opposite\nsign of the standard consensus update. In this way, it counteracts the\nconsensus formation and can be seen as a model of link faults or malicious\nattacks in a communication network, or the impact of trust and antagonism in a\nsocial network. Various probabilistic convergence and divergence conditions are\nestablished. A threshold condition for the strength of the repulsive action is\ngiven for convergence in expectation: when the repulsive weight crosses this\nthreshold value, the algorithm transits from convergence to divergence. An\nexplicit value of the threshold is derived for classes of attractive and\nrepulsive graphs.
