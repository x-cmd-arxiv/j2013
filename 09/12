We numerically solve the $N$-body\nLangevin equations and the stochastic Smoluchowski-Poisson system which takes\nfluctuations (finite $N$ effects) into account. The system switches back and\nforth between the two metastable states (bistability) and the particles\naccumulate successively at the center or at the boundary of the domain. We show\nthat these random transitions exhibit the phenomenology of the ordinary Kramers\nproblem for a Brownian particle in a double-well potential. The distribution of\nthe residence time is Poissonian and the average lifetime of a metastable state\nis given by the Arrhenius law, i.e. it is proportional to the exponential of\nthe barrier of free energy $\\Delta F$ divided by $k_B T$. Since the free energy\nis proportional to the number of particles $N$ for a system with long-range\ninteractions, the lifetime of metastable states scales as $e^N$ and is\nconsiderable for $N\\gg 1$. As a result, in many applications, metastable states\nof systems with long-range interactions can be considered as stable states.\nHowever, for moderate values of $N$, or close to a critical point $T_c$, the\nlifetime of the metastable states is reduced since the barrier of free energy\ndecreases. In that case, the fluctuations become important and the mean field\napproximation is no more valid. This is the situation considered in this paper.\nBy an appropriate change of notations, our results also apply to bacterial\npopulations experiencing chemotaxis in biology. Their dynamics can be described\nby a stochastic Keller-Segel model that takes fluctuations into account and\ngoes beyond the usual mean field approximation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Sep 2013 16:02:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 Jan 2014 15:52:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-23"}

These graphs have been extensively\nstudied in the literature. Given two (edge) intersecting paths in a graph,\ntheir \\emph{split vertices} is the set of vertices having degree at least $3$\nin their union. A pair of (edge) intersecting paths is termed\n\\emph{non-splitting} if they do not have split vertices (namely if their union\nis a path).\n  In this work, motivated by an application in all-optical networks, we define\nthe graph $ENPT({\\cal P})$ of edge-intersecting non-splitting paths of a tree,\ntermed the ENPT graph, as the (edge) graph having a vertex for each path in\n${\\cal P}$, and an edge between every pair of paths that are both\nedge-intersecting and non-splitting.

For\nbipartite graphs, however, much less is known: even the weaker bound\n$2^{O(ex(n,H))}$ has been proven in only a few special cases: for cycles of\nlength four and six, and for some complete bipartite graphs.\n  For even cycles, Bondy and Simonovits proved in the 1970s that ex$(n,C_{2l})\n= O( n^{1 + 1/l} )$, and this bound is conjectured to be sharp up to the\nimplicit constant.

This\nstructure is also present in the inferred distribution $\\rm{P(\\veq)}$ with\naround 80% of the sample having 0 $<$ \\veq\\, $\\leq\\, 300$ \\kms\\ and the other\n20% distributed in the high-velocity region.\n  Conclusions. Most of the stars in our sample rotate with a rate less than\n20%\\ of their break-up velocity. For the bulk of the sample, mass-loss in a\nstellar wind and/or envelope expansion is not efficient enough to significantly\nspin down these stars within the first few Myr of evolution. The presence of a\nsizeable population of fast rotators is compatible with recent population\nsynthesis computations that investigate the influence of binary evolution on\nthe rotation rate of massive stars. Despite the fact that we have excluded\nstars that show significant radial velocity variations, our sample may have\nremained contaminated by post-interaction binary products. The fact that the\nhigh-velocity tail may be preferentially (and perhaps even exclusively),\npopulated by post-binary interaction products, has important implications for\nthe evolutionary origin of systems that produce gamma-ray bursts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Sep 2013 19:59:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

Instead,\nthe evidence points to low [alpha/Fe] ratios resulting from an initial mass\nfunction (IMF) deficient in the highest mass stars. The critical evidence is\nthe 0.4 dex deficiency of [O/Fe], [Mg/Fe] and other hydrostatic elements,\ncontrasting with the normal trend of r-process [Eu/Fe]r with [Fe/H]. Supporting\nevidence comes from the hydrostatic element (O, Mg, Na, Al, Cu) [X/Fe] ratios,\nwhich are inconsistent with iron added to the Milky Way (MW) disk trends. Also,\nthe ratio of hydrostatic to explosive (Si, Ca, Ti) element abundances suggests\na relatively top-light IMF. Abundance similarities with the LMC, Fornax and IC\n1613, suggest that their alpha-element deficiencies also resulted from IMFs\nlacking the most massive SNII.\n  For such a top-light IMF, the normal trend of r-process [Eu/Fe]r with [Fe/H],\nas seen in Sgr, indicates that massive Type II supernovae (>30Msun) cannot be\nmajor sources of r-process elements.\n  High [La/Y] ratios, consistent with leaky-box chemical evolution, are\nconfirmed but ~0.3 dex larger than theoretical AGB predictions. This may be due\nto the 13C pocket mass, or a difference between MW and Sgr AGB stars. Sgr has\nthe lowest [Rb/Zr] ratios known, consistent with low-mass (~2Msun) AGB stars\nnear [Fe/H]=-0.6, likely resulting from leaky-box chemical evolution.\n  The [Cu/O] trend in Sgr and the MW suggest that Cu yields increase with both\nmetallicity and stellar mass, as expected from Cu production by the weak\ns-process in massive stars.\n  Finally, we present an updated hfs line list, an abundance analysis of\nArcturus, and further develop our error analysis formalism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Sep 2013 21:08:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

The measure \\Del_EW\nallows for the possibility of parameter correlations which should be present in\nthe UTH and, since it is model-independent, provides the same value of EWFT for\nthe effective theories as should occur for the UTH. We find that the well-known\nmSUGRA/CMSSM model is fine-tuned under all three measures so that it is\nunlikely to contain the UTH. The non-universal Higgs model NUHM2 appears\nfine-tuned with \\Del_HS,BG > 10^3. But since \\Del_EW can be as small as 7\n(corresponding to 14% fine-tuning), it may contain the UTH for parameter ranges\nwhich allow for low true EWFT.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Sep 2013 22:06:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Sep 2013 15:43:51 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 23 Oct 2013 15:33:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-27"}

In particular, a number of polyhedral nanoparticles have been shown\nto exhibit a rich phase behavior [Agarwal et al., Nature Materials, 2011, 10,\n230]. Since real synthesized particles have polydispersity not only in size but\nalso in shape, we explore here the phase behavior of binary mixtures of hard\nconvex polyhedra having similar sizes but different shapes. Choosing\nrepresentative particle shapes from those readily synthesizable, we study in\nparticular four mixtures: (i) cubes and spheres (with spheres providing a\nnon-polyhedral reference case), (ii) cubes and truncated octahedra, (iii) cubes\nand cuboctahedra, and (iv) cuboctahedra and truncated octahedra. The phase\nbehavior of such mixtures is dependent on the interplay of mixing and packing\nentropy, which can give rise to miscible or phase-separated states. The extent\nof mixing of two such particle types is expected to depend on the degree of\nshape similarity, relative sizes, composition, and compatibility of the crystal\nstructures formed by the pure components. While expectedly the binary systems\nstudied exhibit phase separation at high pressures due to the incompatible\npure-component crystal structures, our study shows that the essential\nqualitative trends in miscibility and phase separation can be correlated to\nproperties of the pure components, such as the relative values of the\norder-disorder transition pressure (ODP) of each component. Specifically, if\nfor a mixture A+B we have that ODP_B <ODP_A and \\Delta ODP = ODP_A - ODP_B,\nthen at any particular pressure where phase separation occurs, the larger the\n\\Delta ODP the lower the solubility of A in the B-rich ordered phase and the\nhigher the solubility of B in the A-rich ordered phase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Sep 2013 22:23:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-13"}

Overall, the Lupus clouds are\nin an early chemical phase. The abundance of H2O ice (2.3+/-0.1*10^-5 relative\nto Nh) is typical for quiescent regions, but lower by a factor of 3-4 compared\nto dense envelopes of YSOs.

It enjoys many attractive properties such as an exact\nsemi-definite linear programming relaxation (SDP relaxation) and strong\nduality. Unfortunately, such properties do not, in general, hold for an\nextended trust-region problem having extra linear constraints. This paper shows\nthat two useful and powerful features of the classical trust-region problem\ncontinue to hold for an extended trust-region problem with linear inequality\nconstraints under a new dimension condition. First, we establish that the class\nof extended trust-region problems has an exact SDP-relaxation, which holds\nwithout the Slater constraint qualification. This is achieved by proving that a\nsystem of quadratic and affine functions involved in the model satisfies a\nrange-convexity whenever the dimension condition is fulfilled. Second, we show\nthat the dimension condition together with the Slater condition ensures that a\nset of combined first and second-order Lagrange multiplier conditions is\nnecessary and sufficient for global optimality of the extended trust-region\nproblem and consequently for strong duality.

PS1-11af is associated with the nucleus of an\nearly-type galaxy at redshift z=0.4046 that exhibits no evidence for star\nformation or AGN activity. Four epochs of spectroscopy reveal a pair of\ntransient broad absorption features in the UV on otherwise featureless spectra.\nDespite the superficial similarity of these features to P-Cygni absorptions of\nsupernovae (SNe), we conclude that PS1-11af is not consistent with the\nproperties of known types of SNe. Blackbody fits to the spectral energy\ndistribution are inconsistent with the cooling, expanding ejecta of a SN, and\nthe velocities of the absorption features are too high to represent material in\nhomologous expansion near a SN photosphere. However, the constant blue colors\nand slow evolution of the luminosity are similar to previous optically-selected\ntidal disruption events (TDEs). The shape of the optical light curve is\nconsistent with models for TDEs, but the minimum accreted mass necessary to\npower the observed luminosity is only ~0.002M_sun, which points to a partial\ndisruption model. A full disruption model predicts higher bolometric\nluminosities, which would require most of the radiation to be emitted in a\nseparate component at high energies where we lack observations. In addition,\nthe observed temperature is lower than that predicted by pure accretion disk\nmodels for TDEs and requires reprocessing to a constant, lower temperature.\nThree deep non-detections in the radio with the VLA over the first two years\nafter the event set strict limits on the production of any relativistic outflow\ncomparable to Swift J1644+57, even if off-axis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Sep 2013 00:27:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

A non-zero component of current parallel to the\nfan is required such that the null's fan plane and spine are not perpendicular.\nOur aims are to provide valid magnetohydrostatic equilibria and to describe the\ncurrent accumulations in various cases involving finite plasma pressure.To\ncreate our equilibrium current structures we use a full, non-resistive,\nmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) code so that no reconnection is allowed. A series of\nexperiments are performed in which a perturbed 3D tilted null relaxes towards\nan equilibrium via real, viscous damping forces. Changes to the initial plasma\npressure and to magnetic parameters are investigated systematically.An\ninitially tilted fan is associated with a non-zero Lorentz force that drives\nthe fan and spine to collapse towards each other, in a similar manner to the\ncollapse of a 2D X-point. In the final equilibrium state for an initially\nradial null with only the current perpendicular to the spine, the current\nconcentrates along the tilt axis of the fan and in a layer about the null point\nwith a sharp peak at the null itself. The continued growth of this peak\nindicates that the system is in an asymptotic regime involving an infinite time\nsingularity at the null. When the initial tilt disturbance (current\nperpendicular to the spine) is combined with a spiral-type disturbance (current\nparallel to the spine), the final current density concentrates in three\nregions: one on the fan along its tilt axis and two around the spine, above and\nbelow the fan. The increased area of current accumulation leads to a weakening\nof the singularity formed at the null. The 3D spine-fan collapse with generic\ncurrent studied here provides the ideal setup for non-steady reconnection\nstudies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Sep 2013 02:53:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-13"}

They are particularly significant in composition tournaments.\nExamples include, not having any check in the first move of the solution and\nnot dressing up the board with unnecessary pieces. Conventions are often\nassociated or even directly conflated with the overall aesthetics or beauty of\na composition. Using an existing experimentally-validated computational\naesthetics model for three-move mate problems, we analyzed sets of\ncomputer-generated compositions adhering to at least 2, 3 and 4 comparable\nconventions to test if simply conforming to more conventions had a positive\neffect on their aesthetics, as is generally believed by human composers. We\nfound slight but statistically significant evidence that it does, but only to a\npoint. We also analyzed human judge scores of 145 three-move mate problems\ncomposed by humans to see if they had any positive correlation with the\ncomputational aesthetic scores of those problems. We found that they did not.\nThese seemingly conflicting findings suggest two main things. First, the right\namount of adherence to composition conventions in a composition has a positive\neffect on its perceived aesthetics. Second, human judges either do not look at\nthe same conventions related to aesthetics in the model used or emphasize\nothers that have less to do with beauty as perceived by the majority of\nplayers, even though they may mistakenly consider their judgements beautiful in\nthe traditional, non-esoteric sense. Human judges may also be relying\nsignificantly on personal tastes as we found no correlation between their\nindividual scores either.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Sep 2013 06:00:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Sep 2016 02:38:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-22"}

Cluster\nasteroseismology of very young stars such as those of NGC2244 has the major\nadvantage that all cluster stars have similar age, distance and initial\nchemical composition, implying drastic restrictions for the stellar modeling\ncompared to asteroseismology of single isolated stars with very different ages\nand metallicities.\n  Our study requires long-term photometric measurements of stars with visual\nmagnitude ranging from 6.5 to 15 in a large FoV with a precision better than 30\nppm for the brightest cluster members (magnitude below 9) up to 500 ppm for the\nfainter ones, which is well achievable with 2-Wheel Kepler, in combination with\nhigh-precision high-resolution spectroscopy and spectro-polarimetry of the\nbrightest pulsating cluster members.

Usually the software consists of many modules. Thus,\nthe delivered reliability is dependent on the operational profile which\nspecifies how the users will use these modules as well as the defect number\nremaining in each module. Therefore, a good testing policy should take the\noperational profile into account and dynamically select tested modules\naccording to the current state of the software during the testing process. This\npaper discusses how to dynamically select tested modules in order to maximize\ndelivered reliability by formulating the selection problem as a dynamic\nprogramming problem. As the testing process is performed only once, risk must\nbe considered during the testing process, which is described by the tester's\nutility function in this paper. Besides, since usually the tester has no\naccurate estimate of the operational profile, by employing robust optimization\ntechnique, we analysis the selection problem in the worst case, given the\nuncertainty set of operational profile. By numerical examples, we show the\nnecessity of maximizing delivered reliability directly and using robust\noptimization technique when the tester has no clear idea of the operational\nprofile. Moreover, it is shown that the risk averse behavior of the tester has\na major influence on the delivered reliability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Sep 2013 07:54:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 Jan 2017 09:34:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-17"}

To alleviate\nthe computational burden that the additional temporal heterogeneity imposes, we\nadopt a massively parallel approach that achieves both fine- and coarse-grain\nparallelization of the computations across branches that accommodate epoch\ntransitions, making extensive use of graphics processing units.

In their condensed form, they display striking quantum\nhydrodynamic features analogous to atomic Bose-Einstein condensates, such as\nlong-range order coherence, superfluidity and quantized vorticity. Their\nvariegated dispersive and dissipative properties, however, set significant\ndifferences from their atomic counterpart. In this work, we report the unique\nphenomenology that is observed when a pulse of light impacts the polariton\nvacuum: the condensate that is instantaneously formed does not splash in real\nspace but instead coheres into an enigmatic structure, featuring concentric\nrings and, most notably, a sharp and bright peak at the center. Using a\nstate-of-the-art ultrafast imaging with 50 fs time steps, we are able to track\nthe dynamics of the polariton mean-field wavefunction in both real and\nreciprocal space. The observation of the real-space collapse of the condensate\ninto an extremely localized---resolution limited---peak is at odd with the\nrepulsive interactions of polaritons and their positive effective mass. An\nunconventional mechanism is therefore at play to account for our observations.\nOur modeling suggests that self-trapping due to a local heating of the crystal\nlattice---that can be described as a collective polaron formed by a polariton\ncondensate---could be involved. These observations hint at the fascinating\nfluid dynamics of polaritons in conditions of extreme intensities and ultrafast\ntimes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Sep 2013 09:54:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 May 2015 17:46:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-10"}

RBMs have been modified to model time series in two main\nways: The Temporal RBM stacks a number of RBMs laterally and introduces\ntemporal dependencies between the hidden layer units; The Conditional RBM, on\nthe other hand, considers past samples of the dataset as a conditional bias and\nlearns a representation which takes these into account. Here we propose a new\ntraining method for both the TRBM and the CRBM, which enforces the dynamic\nstructure of temporal datasets. We do so by treating the temporal models as\ndenoising autoencoders, considering past frames of the dataset as corrupted\nversions of the present frame and minimizing the reconstruction error of the\npresent data by the model. We call this approach Temporal Autoencoding. This\nleads to a significant improvement in the performance of both models in a\nfilling-in-frames task across a number of datasets. The error reduction for\nmotion capture data is 56\\% for the CRBM and 80\\% for the TRBM. Taking the\nposterior mean prediction instead of single samples further improves the\nmodel's estimates, decreasing the error by as much as 91\\% for the CRBM on\nmotion capture data. We also trained the model to perform forecasting on a\nlarge number of datasets and have found TA pretraining to consistently improve\nthe performance of the forecasts. Furthermore, by looking at the prediction\nerror across time, we can see that this improvement reflects a better\nrepresentation of the dynamics of the data as opposed to a bias towards\nreconstructing the observed data on a short time scale.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Sep 2013 10:39:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-13"}

For example, the\n$^{87}$Rb$^{174}$Yb system is characterized by a large positive scattering\nlength of $+880(120)$~a.u., while $^{87}$Rb$^{173}$Yb has $a=-626(88)$~a.u.. On\nthe other hand $^{87}$Rb$^{170}$Yb has a very small scattering length of\n$-14.5(1.8)$~a.u. confirmed by the pair's extremely low thermalization rate.\nFor isotopic combinations including $^{85}$Rb the variation of the interspecies\nscattering lengths is much smoother ranging from $+39.0(1.6)$ a.u. for\n$^{85}$Rb$^{176}$Yb to $+230(10)$ a.u. in the case of $^{85}$Rb$^{168}$Yb.\nHyperfine corrections to these scattering lengths are also given. We further\ncomplement the fitted potential with interaction parameters calculated from\nalternative methods. The recommended value of the van der Waals coefficient is\n$C_6$=2837(13)~a.u. and is in agreement and more precise than the current\nstate-of-the-art theoretical predictions (S. G. Porsev, M. S. Safronova, A.\nDerevianko, and C.W. Clark, arXiv:1307.2654 (2013)).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Sep 2013 12:14:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-11"}

However, recent evidence suggests that: globular clusters passing\nthrough the disk may be able to perturb giant molecular clouds (GMCs)\ntriggering formation of open clusters and some old open clusters may be linked\nto accreted globulars. Here, we further explore the existence of possible\ndynamical connections between globular and open clusters, and realize that the\nmost obvious link must be in the form of gravitational interactions. If open\nclusters are born out of GMCs, they have to move in similar orbits. If we\naccept that globulars can interact with GMCs, triggering star formation, it\nfollows that globular and open clusters must also interact. Consistently,\ntheoretical arguments as well as observational evidence, show that globular and\nopen clusters certainly are interacting populations and their interactions are\nfar more common than usually thought, especially for objects part of the\nbulge/disk. Monte Carlo calculations confirm that conclusion. Globular clusters\nseem capable of not only inducing formation of open clusters but, more often,\ntheir demise. Relatively frequent high speed cluster encounters or cluster\nharassment may also cause, on the long-term, slow erosion and tidal truncation\non the globulars involved.

We make the following contributions. First, we show\nthat in the worst-case (i.e., under adversarial link failures), the usefulness\nof local failover is rather limited: already a small number of failures will\nviolate connectivity properties under any fast failover policy, even though the\nunderlying substrate network remains highly connected. We then present\nrandomized and deterministic algorithms to compute resilient forwarding sets;\nthese algorithms achieve an almost optimal tradeoff.

To get the\nmaximum efficiency, only radiative recombination has been considered using\ntypical radiative recombination parameters of the direct band gap III-V\nsemiconductors, and explicit energy dependence of light absorption. When\nsimulating the efficiency, we selfconsistently took into account the fact that\nthe amount of the heat dissipated by SC decreases as the number of\ncurrent-matched sub-cells increases. As the operating SCs temperature decreases\nboth the open-circuit voltage and the photoconversion efficiency increase. It\nis shown that the above effect is especially strong for SCs operating under AM0\nconditions. As the number of subcells is increased, narrowing the spectral\nrange for each subcell, the photocurrent is additionally reduced due to the\nenergy dependent light absorption, the factor generally ignored in the standard\napproaches. Application of our formalism results in a maximum in the\ntheoretical dependence of the efficiency on the number of subcells, which was\nindeed observed experimentally. Besides agreement with experiment, our\ntheoretical results are also close to other efficiencies calculated using\ndetailed balance based approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Sep 2013 15:02:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-13"}

For the rotationally symmetric case, we develop a\ntheoretical model that analytically relates the shape of the displacement to\nthe polarization for the cases of in-plane and out-of-plane polarization. This\nis verified for several examples, and we further demonstrate controlled\nasymmetric deformations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Sep 2013 14:14:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-02"}
