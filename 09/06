The purpose of this short note is to assure that the\neffective action resolution to the Gribov ambiguity reduces to the standard\nFaddeev-Popov method in the perturbative regime of sufficiently small\ncoupling/large Higgs condensate, thereby not compromising the physical particle\nspectrum of massive gauge bosons and a massless photon for the SU(2) x U(1)\ngauge-Higgs model. The closer the theory gets to the limit of vanishing Higgs\ncondensate, the more the Gribov problem resurfaces with all its consequences.\nWe give some speculations w.r.t. the Fradkin-Shenker insights about the phase\ndiagram.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Sep 2013 16:56:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 31 Jan 2014 07:35:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-25"}

We suppose that dimers are\nself-avoiding and can have only three orientations which coincide with the $x$,\n$y$ or $z$ direction. The interaction $J$ is attractive if the two dimers are\nparallel with each other at the NN distance, zero otherwise. The truncated\ndipolar interaction is characterized by two parameters: its amplitude $D$ and\nthe cutoff distance $r_c$. Using the steepest-descent method, we determine the\nground-state (GS) configuration as functions of $D$ and $r_c$.

We show that the imposition of arbitrary scale\nindependence for the consistent regularized amplitudes lead to additional\nproperties for the irreducible divergent objects.

Concentration (C), Asymmetry (A), Smoothness (S),\nthe Gini index (G), relative contribution of the brightest pixels to the second\norder moment of the flux (M20), ellipticity (E), and the Gini index of the\nsecond order moment (GM) have all been applied to morphologically classify\ngalaxies at various wavelengths. Here we present a catalog of these parameters\nfor the Spitzer Survey of Stellar Structure in Galaxies (S4G), a volume-limited\nnear-infrared imaging survey of nearby galaxies using the 3.6 and 4.5 micron\nchannels of the IRAC camera. Our goal is to provide a reference catalog of\nnear-infrared quantified morphology for high-redshift studies and galaxy\nevolution models with enough detail to resolve stellar mass morphology.\n  We explore where normal, non-interacting galaxies -those typically found on\nthe Hubble tuning fork- lie in this parameter space and show that there is a\ntight relation between Concentration and M20 for normal galaxies. M20 can be\nused to classify galaxies into earlier and later types (e.g., to separate\nspirals from irregulars). Several criteria using these parameters exist to\nselect systems with a disturbed morphology, i.e., those that appear to be\nundergoing a tidal interaction. We examine the applicability of these criteria\nto Spitzer near-infrared imaging. We find that four relations, based on the\nparameters A&S, G&M20, GM, and C&M20, respectively, select outliers in the\nmorphological parameter space, but each selects different subsets of galaxies.\nTwo criteria (GM > 0.6, G > -0.115 x M20 + 0.384) seem most appropriate to\nidentify possible mergers and the merger fraction in near-infrared surveys. We\nfind no strong relation between lopsidedness and most of these morphological\nparameters, except for a weak dependence of lopsidedness on Concentration and\nM20.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Sep 2013 19:03:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

Very high carrier mobility in a\ngraphene-on-boron nitride assembly is now well-established, but it has been\nanticipated that appropriately designed hybrids could perform other tasks as\nwell. A heterostructure of graphene and molybdenum disulphide (MoS$_2$) is\nexpected to be sensitive to photo illumination due to the optical bandgap in\nMoS$_2$. Despite significant advances in device architectures with both\ngraphene and MoS$_2$, binary graphene-MoS$_2$ hybrids have not been realized so\nfar, and the promising opto-electronic properties of such structures remain\nelusive. Here we demonstrate experimentally that graphene-on-MoS$_2$ binary\nheterostructures display an unexpected and remarkable persistent\nphotoconductivity under illumination of white light. The photoconductivity can\nnot only be tuned independently with both light intensity and back gate\nvoltage, but in response to a suitable combination of light and gate voltage\npulses the device functions as a re-writable optoelectronic switch or memory.\nThe persistent, or `ON', state shows virtually no relaxation or decay within\nthe the experimental time scales for low and moderate photoexcitation\nintensity, indicating a near-perfect charge retention. A microscopic model\nassociates the persistence with strong localization of carriers in MoS$_2$.\nThese effects are also observable at room temperature, and with chemical vapour\ndeposited graphene, and hence are naturally scalable for large area\napplications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Sep 2013 19:40:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-06"}

It is\nshown that equilibrium (equation-of-state) phenomena and non-equilibrium\ndynamical processes like photoionization are characterised by different values\nof the IPD. In the former, the ionization potential of an atom embedded in\nmatter is the difference in the free energy of the many-body system between\nstates of thermodynamic equilibrium differing by the ionization state of just\none atom. Typically, this energy is less than that required to ionize the same\natom in vacuo. Probably, the best known example of such an IPD is that of\nStewart and Pyatt (SP). However, it is a common misconception that this formula\nshould apply directly to the energy of a photon causing photoionization, since\nthis is a local adiabatic process that occurs in the absence of a response from\nthe surrounding plasma. To achieve the prescribed final equilibrium state,\nadditional energy, in the form of heat and work, is transferred between the\natom and its surroundings. This additional relaxation energy is sufficient to\nexplain the discrepancy between recent spectroscopic measurements of IPD in\ndense plasmas and the predictions of the SP formula. This paper provides a\ndetailed account of an analytical approach to calculating thermodynamic and\nspectroscopic (adiabatic) IPDs in multicomponent Coulomb systems of arbitrary\ncoupling strength. The ramifications are carefully examined in order to\nelucidate the roles of the various IPD forms. A formulation in terms of free\nenergy leads to an analytical equation of state (EoS) that is thermodynamically\nself-consistent, provided that the bound and free electrons are dynamically\nseparable. Of the various proposed formulae, the Spectroscopic (adiabatic) IPD\ngives the most consistent agreement with spectroscopic measurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Sep 2013 19:45:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Sep 2013 14:50:19 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 9 Dec 2013 20:57:48 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 23 Apr 2014 10:59:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-21"}

Rapid electron\ncooling is necessary to produce this situation, yet the physical origin of that\ncooling remains uncertain. To assess the cooling scenario responsible for\noverionization, in this paper, we identify and map the overionized plasma in\nthe Galactic SNR W49B based on a 220 ks Chandra Advanced CCD Imaging\nSpectrometer (ACIS) observation. We performed a spatially-resolved\nspectroscopic analysis, measuring the electron temperature by modeling the\ncontinuum and comparing it to the temperature given by the flux ratio of the\nHe-like and H-like lines of sulfur and of argon. Using these results, we find\nthat W49B is overionized in the west, with a gradient of increasing\noverionization from east to west. As the ejecta expansion is impeded by\nmolecular material in the east but not in the west, our overionization maps\nsuggest the dominant cooling mechanism is adiabatic expansion of the hot\nplasma.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Sep 2013 20:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

For each PDS\nwe derived tau_eff and sigma and compared these theoretical values with the\ntheoretical scaling relations derived from the theoretical model and the Kepler\nmeasurements. We derive theoretical scaling relations for tau_eff and sigma,\nwhich show the same dependence on nu_max as the observed scaling relations.

Our modelling provides additional theoretical support for the observed\nvariations of sigma and tau_eff with nu_m max.

In this work, we show that the solution to\nthis problem, and its generalization to $N$ dimensions, allows us to discover a\nquantized form of the Johnson-Lindenstrauss (JL) Lemma, i.e., one that combines\na linear dimensionality reduction procedure with a uniform quantization of\nprecision $\\delta>0$. In particular, given a finite set $\\mathcal S \\subset\n\\mathbb R^N$ of $S$ points and a distortion level $\\epsilon>0$, as soon as $M >\nM_0 = O(\\epsilon^{-2} \\log S)$, we can (randomly) construct a mapping from\n$(\\mathcal S, \\ell_2)$ to $(\\delta\\mathbb Z^M, \\ell_1)$ that approximately\npreserves the pairwise distances between the points of $\\mathcal S$.\nInterestingly, compared to the common JL Lemma, the mapping is quasi-isometric\nand we observe both an additive and a multiplicative distortions on the\nembedded distances.

Moreover, for coarse quantization, i.e., for high\n$\\delta$ compared to the set radius, the distortion is mainly additive, while\nfor small $\\delta$ we tend to a Lipschitz isometric embedding.

When the legitimate receiver has more (or equal)\nantennas than the eavesdropper, we prove the first MIMOME secrecy capacity with\npartial CSIT by establishing a new secrecy capacity upper-bound. The key step\nis to form an MIMOME degraded channel by dividing the legitimate receiver's\nchannel matrix into two submatrices, and setting one of the submatrices to be\nthe same as the eavesdropper's channel matrix. Next, under the total power\nconstraint over all transmit antennas, we analytically solve the channel-input\ncovariance matrix optimization problem to fully characterize the MIMOME secrecy\ncapacity. Typically, the MIMOME optimization problems are non-concave. However,\nthank to the proposed degraded channel, we can transform the stochastic MIMOME\noptimization problem to be a Schur-concave one and then find its solution.\nBesides total power constraint, we also investigate the secrecy capacity when\nthe transmitter is subject to the practical per-antenna power constraint. The\ncorresponding optimization problem is even more difficult since it is not\nSchuar-concave. Under the two power constraints considered, the corresponding\nMIMOME secrecy capacities can both scale with the signal-to-noise ratios (SNR)\nwhen the difference between numbers of antennas at legitimate receiver and\neavesdropper are large enough. However, when the legitimate receiver and\neavesdropper have a single antenna each, such SNR scalings do not exist for\nboth cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Sep 2013 01:32:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-13"}

The chemical\nabundances of the stars in the Fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy (Fornax dSph)\nprovide excellent information for setting constraints on the models of the\ngalactic chemical evolution. In this work, adopting the five-component\napproach, we fit the abundances of the Fornax dSph stars, including $\\alpha$\nelements, iron group elements and neutron-capture elements. For most sample\nstars, the relative contributions from the various processes to the elemental\nabundances are not usually in the MW proportions. We find that the\ncontributions from massive stars to the primary $\\alpha$ elements and iron\ngroup elements increase monotonously with increasing [Fe/H].

This is in sharp contrast to the cases of ordinary affine\nalgebras and the other types of affine superalgebras.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Sep 2013 03:52:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Oct 2013 09:40:44 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 4 Oct 2013 00:24:25 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 2 Apr 2014 00:52:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-03"}

Real\ndata often suffer from very few observations, with support not meeting the\nrandom requirements, ubiquitous presence of noise and potentially gross\ncorruptions, sometimes with these simultaneously occurring.\n  This paper proposes a Proximal Alternating Robust Subspace Minimization\n(PARSuMi) method to tackle the three problems.

We suggest that, based on our theoretical and\nobservational understanding of Galactic chemical evolution, nitrogen abundances\nmay serve as a proxy for helium abundances of disk stars. Utilizing\nhigh-resolution near-UV Keck/HIRES spectroscopy, we determine N abundances in\nthe Pleiades and Hyades dwarfs from NH features in the 3330 Ang region. While\nour Hyades N abundances show a modest 0.2 dex trend over a 800 K Teff range, we\nfind the Pleiades N abundance (by number) is 0.13+/-0.05 dex lower than in the\nHyades for stars in a smaller overlapping Teff range around 6000 K; possible\nsystematic errors in the lower Pleiades N abundance result are estimated to be\nat the <0.10 dex level. Our results indicate [N/Fe]=0 for both the Pleiades and\nHyades, consistent with the ratios exhibited by local Galactic disk field stars\nin other studies. If N production is a reliable tracer of He production in the\ndisk, then our results suggest the Pleiades He abundance is no larger than that\nin the Hyades. This finding is supported by the relative Pleiades-Hyades C, O,\nand Fe abundances interpreted in the current context of Galactic chemical\nevolution, and is resistant to the effects on our derived N abundances of a He\nabundance difference like that needed to explain the Pleiades distance modulus\ndiscrepancy.

In\nparallel to the foundational importance due to the realization of a dynamical\nsuperselection rule and the theory of quantum measurements, this is an\nimportant step forward in protecting and controlling quantum dynamics and,\nbroadly speaking, quantum information processing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Sep 2013 07:13:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 2 Feb 2014 11:27:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-04"}

The perils of such a\nsearch may have appeared insurmountable when considering the coarse ring-shaped\nGW localizations spanning thousands of deg^2 using time-of-arrival information\nalone. We show that leveraging the amplitude and phase information of the\npredicted GW signal narrows the localization to arcs with a median area of only\n~250 deg^2, thereby making an EM search tractable. Based on the locations and\norientations of the two LIGO detectors, we find that the GW sensitivity is\nlimited to one polarization and thus to only two sky quadrants. Thus, the rates\nof GW events with two interferometers is only ~40% of the rate with three\ninterferometers of similar sensitivity. Another important implication of the\nsky quadrant bias is that EM observatories in North America and Southern Africa\nwould be able to systematically respond to GW triggers several hours sooner\nthan Russia and Chile. Given the larger sky areas and the relative proximity of\ndetected mergers, 1m-class telescopes with very wide-field cameras are well\npositioned for the challenge of finding an EM counterpart. Identification of\nthe EM counterpart amidst the even larger numbers of false positives further\nunderscores the importance of building a comprehensive catalog of foreground\nstellar sources, background AGN and potential host galaxies in the local\nuniverse.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Sep 2013 07:29:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

The proposed\ntree-based Chase-type algorithm takes the set of all vectors as the set of\ntesting patterns, and hence definitely delivers the most-likely codeword\nprovided that the computational resources are allowed. All the testing patterns\nare arranged in an ordered rooted tree according to the likelihood bounds of\nthe possibly generated codewords, which is an extension of Wu and Pados' method\nfrom binary into $q$-ary linear block codes. While performing the algorithm,\nthe ordered rooted tree is constructed progressively by adding at most two\nleafs at each trial. The ordered tree naturally induces a sufficient condition\nfor the most-likely codeword. That is, whenever the tree-based Chase-type\nalgorithm exits before a preset maximum number of trials is reached, the output\ncodeword must be the most-likely one. But, in fact, the algorithm can be\nterminated by setting a discrepancy threshold instead of a maximum number of\ntrials. When the tree-based Chase-type algorithm is combined with\nGuruswami-Sudan (GS) algorithm, each trial can be implement in an extremely\nsimple way by removing from the gradually updated Grobner basis one old point\nand interpolating one new point. Simulation results show that the tree-based\nChase-type algorithm performs better than the recently proposed Chase-type\nalgorithm by Bellorado et al with less trials (on average) given that the\nmaximum number of trials is the same.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Sep 2013 07:29:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Oct 2013 06:20:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 4 Dec 2013 02:44:14 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 25 May 2022 18:29:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-27"}

A decay of active SNARE concentration in aging cisternae provides\nthe seed for a cis > trans SNARE gradient that generates the predominantly\nretrograde vesicle flux which further enhances the gradient. This flux in turn\nyields the observed inhomogeneous steady-state distribution of Golgi enzymes,\nwhich compete with each other and with the SNAREs for incorporation into\ntransport vesicles. We show analytically that the steady state SNARE\nconcentration decays exponentially with the cisterna number.

Our universe\nlives inside the bubble, which can be described as a\nFriedman-Lema\\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) universe with negative spatial\ncurvature, undergoing slow-roll inflation. We pay special attention to the\nissue of an initial state for quantum fluctuations. A \"vacuum state\" defined by\na positive-frequency mode in de Sitter space charted by open coordinates is\ndifferent from the Euclidean vacuum (which is equivalent to the so-called\n\"Bunch-Davies vacuum\"). Quantum tunneling then modifies the initial state away\nfrom the original Euclidean vacuum. While most of the previous study on\nmodifications of the initial quantum state introduces, by hand, an initial time\nat which the quantum state is modified as well as the form of the modification,\nan effective initial time naturally emerges and the form is fixed by quantum\ntunneling in open inflation models. Therefore, open inflation enables a\nself-consistent computation of the effect of a modified initial state on the\nbispectrum.

However,\ngalaxy formation is inefficient in their shallow potential wells and so we\nexpect these low-mass haloes and subhaloes to be dark. Can we tell the\ndifference between a Universe in which low-mass haloes are present but dark and\none in which they never formed, thereby providing a robust test of the CDM\nmodel? We address this question using cosmological simulations to examine how\nproperties of low-mass haloes that are potentially accessible to observation,\nsuch as their spatial clustering, rate of accretions and mergers onto massive\ngalaxies and the angular momentum content of massive galaxies, differ between a\nLCDM model and dark matter models in which low-mass halo formation is\nsuppressed. Adopting an effective cut-off mass scale M_cut below which\nsmall-scale power is suppressed in the initial conditions, we study dark matter\nmodels in which M_cut varies between 5e9 Msol/h and 1e11 Msol/h, equivalent to\nthe host haloes of dwarf and low mass galaxies. Our results show that both the\nclustering strength of low-mass haloes around galaxy-mass primaries and the\nrate at which they merge with these primaries is sensitive to the assumed value\nof M_cut; in contrast, suppressing low-mass halo formation has little influence\non the angular momentum content of galaxy-mass haloes -- it is the quiescence\nor violence of a halo's assembly history that has a more marked effect.\nHowever, we expect that measuring the effect on spatial clustering or the\nmerger rate is likely to be observationally difficult for realistic values of\nM_cut, and so isolating the effect of this small-scale structure would appear\nto be remarkably difficult to detect, at least in the present day Universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Sep 2013 10:34:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

However, the nature of the mechanism responsible for the tidal\ndissipation in such systems remains uncertain. In this paper, we claim that the\nso-called elliptical instability may play a major role in these systems,\nexplaining some systematic features present in the observations. This\nhydrodynamic instability, arising in rotating flows with elliptical\nstreamlines, is suspected to be present in both planet and star of such\nsystems, which are elliptically deformed by tides. The presence and the\ninfluence of the elliptical instability in gaseous bodies, such as stars or hot\nJupiters, are most of the time neglected. In this paper, using numerical\nsimulations and theoretical arguments, we consider several features associated\nto the elliptical instability in hot-Jupiter systems. In particular, the use of\nad hoc boundary conditions makes it possible to estimate the amplitude of the\nelliptical instability in gaseous bodies. We also consider the influence of\ncompressibility on the elliptical instability, and compare the results to the\nincompressible case. We demonstrate the ability for the elliptical instability\nto grow in the presence of differential rotation, with a possible synchronized\nlatitude, provided that the tidal deformation and/or the rotation rate of the\nfluid are large enough. Moreover, the amplitude of the instability for a\ncentrally-condensed mass of fluid is of the same order of magnitude as for an\nincompressible fluid for a given distance to the threshold of the instability.\nFinally, we show that the assumption of the elliptical instability being the\nmain tidal dissipation process in eccentric inflated hot Jupiters and\nmisaligned stars is consistent with current data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Sep 2013 12:56:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

One\nadvantage is that they bridge two different scales: the microscopic and the\nmacroscopic one. Diffusion is a mathematical idealisation, however: it assumes\nvanishingly small state changes at the microscopic level. In real biological\nsystems this is often not the case. The differential Chapman-Kolmogorov\nequation is more appropriate to model population dynamics that is not well\ndescribed by drift and diffusion alone.\n  Here, the method of characteristics is used to transform deterministic\ndynamics away and find a coordinate frame where this equation reduces to a\nMaster equation. There is no longer a drift term, and solution methods there\nare insensitive to density gradients, making the method suitable for jump\nprocesses with arbitrary jump sizes. Moreover, its solution is universal: it no\nlonger depends explicitly on the deterministic system.\n  We demonstrate the technique on simple models of neuronal populations.\nSurprisingly, it is suitable for fast neural dynamics, even though in the new\ncoordinate frame state space may expand rapidly towards infinity. We\ndemonstrate universality: the method is applicable to any one dimensional\nneural model and show this on populations of leaky- and\nquadratic-integrate-and-fire neurons. In the diffusive limit, excellent\napproximations of Fokker-Planck equations are achieved. Nothing in the approach\nis particular to neuroscience, and the neural models are simple enough to serve\nas an example of dynamical systems that demonstrates the method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Sep 2013 14:40:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 9 Sep 2013 20:52:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-11"}

Our main\naims are to determine the chemical composition of the PNe and to study the\nbehaviour of the abundance discrepancy problem (ADF) in this type of planetary\nnebulae. The detection of a large number of optical recombination lines (ORLs)\nand collisionally excited lines (CELs) from different ions were presented\npreviously. Most of the ORLs were reported for the first time in these PNe.\nIonic abundances were derived from the available CELs and ORLs, using\npreviously determined physical conditions. Based on these two sets of ionic\nabundances, we derived the total chemical abundances in the nebulae using\nsuitable ICFs (when available). In spite of the [WC] nature of the central\nstars, moderate ADF(O^++), in the range from 1.2 to 4, were found for all the\nobjects. We found that when the quality of the spectra is high enough the ORLs\nO^++/H^+ abundance ratios obtained from different multiplets excited mainly by\nrecombination are very similar. Possible dependence of ADFs with some nebular\ncharacteristics were analysed, finding no correlation. Abundances derived from\nCELs were corrected by determining the t^2 parameter. O abundances for PNe,\nderived from ORLs, are in general larger than the solar abundance. We derived\nthe C/O ratio from ORLs and N/O and alpha-element/O ratios from CELs and found\nthat these PNe are, in average, N-and C-richer than the average of large PN\nsamples. About half of our sample is C-rich (C/O>1). The alpha-elements grow in\nlockstep with O abundance. Comparing the N/O and C /O ratios with those derived\nfrom stellar evolution models, we estimate that about half of our PNe have\nprogenitors with initial masses > 4 M_sun. No correlation was found between the\nstellar [WC]-type and the nebular abundances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Sep 2013 14:53:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Sep 2013 01:55:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 12 Sep 2013 15:20:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

Most prominent is the unbounded increase in oscillations of the\nparticle's state as it approaches the origin when the attractive coupling\nparameter is greater than the critical value of 1/4. Due to this unphysical\ndivergence in oscillations, we are proposing that the interaction gets screened\nat short distances making the coupling parameter acquire an effective\n(renormalized) value that falls within the weak range 0 to 1/4. This prevents\nthe oscillations form growing without limit giving a lower bound to the energy\nspectrum and forcing the Hamiltonian of the system to be self-adjoint.\nTechnically, this translates into a regularization scheme whereby the inverse\nsquare potential is replaced near the origin by another that has the same\nsingularity but with a weak coupling strength.

However, the development process of such tools\nfrequently differs from conventional software development; partly because of\nthe nature of research, where the problems being addressed are not always fully\nunderstood; partly because the majority of the development is often carried out\nby scientists with limited experience and exposure to best practices of\nsoftware engineering. Often the software development suffers from the pressure\nto publish scientific results and that credit for software development is\nlimited in comparison. Fundamental components of software engineering like\nmodular and reusable design, validation, documentation, and software\nintegration as well as effective maintenance and user support tend to be\ndisregarded due to lack of resources and qualified specialists. Thus innovative\ndevelopments are often hindered by steep learning curves required to master\ndevelopment for legacy software packages full of ad hoc solutions.
