In some\ncases, these statistical patterns are sufficiently strong, and occur\nsufficiently far from the transition, that they can be used to predict the\ndistance between the current operating state and the critical point. In other\ncases CSD comes too late to be a good indicator. In order to better understand\nthe extent to which CSD can be used as an indicator of proximity to bifurcation\nin power systems, this paper derives autocorrelation functions for three small\npower system models, using the stochastic differential algebraic equations\n(SDAE) associated with each. The analytical results, along with numerical\nresults from a larger system, show that, although CSD does occur in power\nsystems, its signs sometimes appear only when the system is very close to\ntransition. On the other hand, the variance in voltage magnitudes consistently\nshows up as a good early warning of voltage collapse.

A large variety of storage-and-release\nmodels have been developed and opposed to each other since 40 years. For\nexample, photospheric flux emergence vs. flux cancellation, localized coronal\nreconnection vs. large-scale ideal instabilities and loss of equilibria,\ntether-cutting vs. breakout reconnection, and so on. The competition between\nall these approaches has led to a tremendous drive in developing and testing\nall these concepts, by coupling state-of-the-art models and observations.\nThanks to these developments, it now becomes possible to compare all these\nmodels with one another, and to revisit their interpretation in light of their\ncommon and their different behaviors.

The mass loss of the star clusters is continuous\nirrespective of the tidal history of the host halo, but major merger events\ntend to increase the rate of mass loss. From the selected two dark matter\nhaloes, the halo that experienced the larger number of mergers tends to drive a\nsmaller mass loss rate from the embedded star clusters, even though the final\nmasses of both haloes are similar. We identify two families of star clusters:\nnative clusters, which become part of the main halo before its final major\nmerger event, and the immigrant clusters, which are accreted upon or after this\nevent; native clusters tend to evaporate more quickly than immigrant clusters.\nAccounting for the evolution of the dark matter halo causes immigrant star\nclusters to retain more mass than when the z=0 tidal field is taken as a static\npotential. The reason for this is the weaker tidal field experienced by\nimmigrant star clusters before merging with the larger dark matter halo.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Sep 2013 20:00:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-05"}

The exact nature of this link is\nstill under debate. Radio jets have long been argued to be an ideal mechanism\nthat allows AGN to interact with their host galaxy and regulate star-formation.\nIn this context, we are using a sample of radio sources in the North Ecliptic\nPole (NEP) field to study the nature of the putative link between AGN activity\nand star-formation. This is done by means of spectral energy distribution (SED)\nfitting. We use the excellent spectral coverage of the AKARI infrared space\ntelescope together with the rich ancillary data available in the NEP to build\nSEDs extending from UV to far-IR wavelengths. Through SED fitting we constrain\nboth the AGN and host galaxy components. We find a significant AGN component in\nour sample of relatively faint radio-sources ($<$mJy), that increases in power\nwith increasing radio-luminosity. At the highest radio-luminosities, the\npresence of powerful jets dominates the radio emission of these sources. A\npositive correlation is found between the luminosity of the AGN component and\nthat of star-formation in the host galaxy, independent of the radio luminosity.\nBy contrast, for a given redshift and AGN luminosity, we find that increasing\nradio-luminosity leads to a decrease in the specific star-formation rate. The\nmost radio-loud AGN are found to lie on the main sequence of star-formation for\ntheir respective redshifts. For the first time, such a two-sided feedback\nprocess is seen in the same sample. We conclude that radio jets do suppress\nstar-formation in their host galaxies but appear not to totally quench it. Our\nresults therefore support the maintenance nature of \"radio-mode\" feedback from\nradio-AGN jets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Sep 2013 20:00:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Oct 2013 07:18:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-19"}

In this type\nof model a dark matter particle decays into a slightly less massive stable dark\nmatter daughter particle and a comparably light particle. The small mass\nsplitting provides a non-relativistic kick velocity V_k to the daughter\nparticle resulting in free-streaming and subsequent damping of small-scale\ndensity fluctuations. Current Lyman-alpha forest power spectrum measurements\nprobe comoving scales up to ~ 2-3 h^-1 Mpc at redshifts z ~ 2-4, providing one\nof the most robust ways to probe cosmological density fluctuations on\nrelatively small scales. The suppression of structure growth due to the\nfree-streaming of dark matter daughter particles also has a significant impact\non the neutral hydrogen cloud distribution, which traces the underlying dark\nmatter distribution well at high redshift. We exploit Lyman-alpha forest power\nspectrum measurements to constrain the amount of free-streaming of dark matter\nin such models and thereby place limits on decaying dark matter based only on\nthe dynamics of cosmological perturbations without any assumptions about the\ninteractions of the decay products.

As a result, an adversary can derive the device's secret keys\nwithout breaking the underlying cryptosystem. We introduce a new threat model,\nunder which there is a systemic solution to such randomness flaws. In our\nmodel, when a device generates a cryptographic key, it incorporates some random\nvalues from an entropy authority into its cryptographic secrets and then proves\nto the authority, using zero-knowledge-proof techniques, that it performed this\noperation correctly.

Our aim is to\nfind a routing policy that minimizes the regret (the cumulative difference of\nexpected delay) between the path chosen by the policy and the unknown optimal\npath. We formulate the problem as a combinatorial bandit optimization problem\nand consider several scenarios that differ in where routing decisions are made\nand in the information available when making the decisions.

These frequency changes are derived from the Schwarzschild\nred-shift result or the analogous result from a Kerr wave equation. The LCM\nmaps the small curvatures of the emitter galactic frame onto those of the\nreceiver galactic frame, and then returns the map to the associated flat frames\nwhere measurements are made. This treatment rests upon estimates of the\nluminous matter in both the emitter and receiver galaxies to determine these\nsmall curvatures.

To integrate these different\napproaches, we developed EnhancerFinder, a novel method for predicting\ndevelopmental enhancers and their tissue specificity. EnhancerFinder uses a\ntwo-step multiple-kernel learning approach to integrate DNA sequence motifs,\nevolutionary patterns, and thousands of diverse functional genomics datasets\nfrom a variety of cell types and developmental stages. We trained\nEnhancerFinder on hundreds of experimentally verified human developmental\nenhancers from the VISTA Enhancer Browser, in contrast to histone mark or\nsequence-based enhancer definitions commonly used. We comprehensively evaluated\nEnhancerFinder, and found that our integrative approach improves enhancer\nprediction accuracy over previous approaches that consider a single type of\ndata. Our evaluation highlights the importance of considering information from\nmany tissues when predicting specific types of enhancers. We find that VISTA\nenhancers active in embryonic heart are easier to predict than enhancers active\nin several other tissues due to their uniquely high GC content. We applied\nEnhancerFinder to the entire human genome and predicted 84,301 developmental\nenhancers and their tissue specificity. These predictions provide specific\nfunctional annotations for large amounts of human non-coding DNA, and are\nsignificantly enriched near genes with annotated roles in their predicted\ntissues and hits from genome-wide association studies.

We assume\nthat interparticle collisions via this short ranged part of the potential are\nsufficient to randomize the velocities of the particles on a very small time\nscale compared with the fundamental time scale defined as the particle diameter\ndivided by the mean thermal velocity. When this is the case, the graphical\ntheory suggests that both the particle current correlation functions and the\nmemory function of the particle density correlation function evolve on two\ndistinct time scales, the very short time scale just mentioned and another that\nis much longer than the fundamental time scale. The diagrams that describe the\nmotion on each of these time scales are identified. When the two time scales\nare very different, a dramatic simplification of the diagrammatic theory at\nlong times takes place. We identify an irreducible memory function and a more\nbasic function, which we call the irreducible memory kernel. This latter\nfunction evolves on the longer time scale only and determines the time\ndependence of the density and current correlation functions of interest at long\ntimes.

New massive\nsimulations are being built to self-consistently determine the radial profiles\nof density and temperature. However, these new codes have failed to realize\nthat modern gyrokinetic formulations, composed of a gyrokinetic Fokker-Planck\nequation and a gyrokinetic quasineutrality equation, are only valid for delta-f\nsimulations that do not reach the longer transport time scales necessary to\nevolve radial profiles.

The proposed interconnect resembles a parallel\nplate capacitor filled with a piezoelectric, where one of the plates is made of\na magnetoelastic material. The operation of the interconnect is based on the\neffect of stress-mediated anisotropy modulation, where an electric field\napplied across the piezoelectric material produces stress, which, in turn,\naffects the anisotropy field in the magnetostrictive material. We present the\nresults of numerical modeling illustrating signal propagation through the\ninterconnect. The model combines electric and magnetic parts, where the\nelectric part describes the distribution of an electric field through the\npiezoelectric and the magnetic part describes the change of magnetization in\nthe magnetoelastic layer. The model is based on the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert\nequation with the electric field dependent anisotropy term included. The\nutilization of the electro-magnetic coupling makes it possible to amplify\nmagnetic signal during its propagation via energy conversion from the electric\nto magnetic domains. Potentially, synthetic multiferroic interconnects can be\nimplemented in a variety of spin-based devices ensuring reliable and low-energy\nconsuming data transmission. According to the estimates, the group velocity of\nmagnetic signals may be up to 100 km/s with energy dissipation less than aJ per\nbit per 100nm. The fundamental limits and practical shortcoming of the proposed\napproach are also discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Sep 2013 00:54:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-01"}

This hypothesis is supported by a set of computational\nmodels where an artificial society of agents evolved to generate more diverse\nand valuable cultural outputs under conditions of recursive recall. We propose\nthat the capacity to see things in context arose much later, following the\nappearance of anatomically modern humans. This second transition was brought on\nby the onset of contextual focus: the capacity to shift between a minimally\ncontextual analytic mode of thought, and a highly contextual associative mode\nof thought, conducive to combining concepts in new ways and 'breaking out of a\nrut'. When contextual focus is implemented in an art-generating computer\nprogram, the resulting artworks are seen as more creative and appealing.

A large number of replication is done in order to provide\nreliability. This makes the system expensive. Various methods have been\nproposed over time to reduce the degree of replication and yet provide same\nlevel of reliability. One recently suggested scheme is of Regenerating codes,\nwhere a file is divided in to parts which are then processed by a coding\nmechanism and network coding to provide large number of parts. These are stored\nat various nodes with more than one part at each node. These codes can generate\nwhole file and can repair a failed node by contacting some out of total\nexisting nodes. This property ensures reliability in case of node failure and\nuses clever replication. This also optimizes bandwidth usage. In a practical\nscenario, the original file will be read and updated many times. With every\nupdate, we will have to update the data stored at many nodes. Handling multiple\nrequests at the same time will bring a lot of complexity. Reading and writing\nor multiple writing on the same data at the same time should also be prevented.\nIn this paper, we propose an algorithm that manages and executes all the\nrequests from the users which reduces the update complexity.

We first answer these claims---explaining\nwhy the first is based on a definition of \"a priori knowledge\" so strange that,\nwere it adopted, almost no quantum algorithm could be distinguished from a pure\nrandom-number source; while the second is neither new nor a practical obstacle\nto interesting BosonSampling experiments. However, we then go further, and\naddress some interesting research questions inspired by Gogolin et al.'s\nmistaken arguments. We prove that, with high probability over a Haar-random\nmatrix A, the BosonSampling distribution induced by A is far from the uniform\ndistribution in total variation distance. More surprisingly, and directly\ncounter to Gogolin et al., we give an efficient algorithm that distinguishes\nthese two distributions with constant bias. Finally, we offer three \"bonus\"\nresults about BosonSampling. First, we report an observation of Fernando\nBrandao: that one can efficiently sample a distribution that has large entropy\nand that's indistinguishable from a BosonSampling distribution by any circuit\nof fixed polynomial size. Second, we show that BosonSampling distributions can\nbe efficiently distinguished from uniform even with photon losses and for\ngeneral initial states.

In this paper, by analyzing the growth\nof user activity and item popularity in four empirical social media networks,\ni.e., Amazon, Flickr, Delicious and Wikipedia, it is found that cross links\nbetween users and items are more likely to be created by active users and to be\nacquired by popular items, where user activity and item popularity are measured\nby the number of cross links associated with users and items.

In chapter 1, I will generalize the three term\nrecurrence relation in linear differential equation in a backward for the\ninfinite series and polynomial which makes A_n term terminated including all\nhigher terms of B_n's. In chapters 2-9, I will apply reversible three term\nrecurrence formula to (1) the power series expansion in closed forms, (2) its\nintegral representation and (3) generating functions of Heun, Confluent Heun,\nGCH, Lame and Mathieu equations that consist of three term recursion relation\nfor the infinite series and polynomial which makes A_n term terminated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Sep 2013 23:01:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 3 Nov 2013 18:59:05 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 8 Dec 2013 13:59:39 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 16 Jan 2014 04:16:55 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 27 Jan 2014 15:12:10 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Mon, 3 Feb 2014 14:18:50 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Sun, 23 Feb 2014 22:46:18 GMT"},{"version":"v8","created":"Tue, 4 Nov 2014 17:10:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-05"}
