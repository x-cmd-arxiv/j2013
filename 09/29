To identify prominent symmetric\nregions which overlap in space and vary in form, the proposed framework is\ndecoupled into a Correspondence Space Voting procedure followed by a\nTransformation Space Mapping procedure. In the correspondence space voting\nprocedure, significant symmetries are first detected by identifying surface\npoint pairs on the input shape that exhibit local similarity in terms of their\nintrinsic geometry while simultaneously maintaining an intrinsic distance\nstructure at a global level. Since different point pairs can share a common\npoint, the detected symmetric shape regions can potentially overlap. To this\nend, a global intrinsic distance-based voting technique is employed to ensure\nthe inclusion of only those point pairs that exhibit significant symmetry. In\nthe transformation space mapping procedure, the Functional Map framework is\nemployed to generate the final map of symmetries between point pairs. The\ntransformation space mapping procedure ensures the retrieval of the underlying\ndense correspondence map throughout the 3D shape that follows a particular\nsymmetry. Additionally, the formulation of a novel cost matrix enables the\ninner product to succesfully indicate the complexity of the underlying symmetry\ntransformation. The proposed transformation space mapping procedure is shown to\nresult in the formulation of a semi-metric symmetry space where each point in\nthe space represents a specific symmetry transformation and the distance\nbetween points represents the complexity between the corresponding\ntransformations. Experimental results show that the proposed framework can\nsuccessfully process complex 3D shapes that possess rich symmetries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Sep 2013 16:11:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-01"}

In the curved superspace all those theories are described in terms\nof a single chiral scalar curvature superfeld $\\mathcal{R}$. Each of those\ntheories can be dualized into a matter-coupled supergravity without higher\nderivatives. The first type is parametrized by a single non-holomorphic\npotential $N(\\mathcal{R},\\bar{\\mathcal{R}})$, and gives rise to the dual\nmatter-coupled supergravities with two dynamical chiral matter superfields\nhaving a no-scale K\\\"ahler potential.

Each face is\nassigned a label {x:Theta(x)}; x represents a unique n-dimensional coordinate\nstring, Theta(x) is the value of the function. The walk searches Theta(x) for\noptima by following five simple rules: (1) select a random coordinate and mark\nit as the `initial pivot'; (2) probe all unmarked adjacent coordinates, then\nselect and mark the coordinate with the 'best value' as the new pivot; (3)\ncontinue the walk until either the 'best value' <= `target value' or the walk\nis being blocked by adjacent coordinates that are already pivots; (4) if the\nwalk is blocked, restart the walk from a randomly selected `new initial pivot';\n(5) if needed, manage the memory overflow with a streaming-like buffer of\nappropriate size.\n  Hard instances from a number of problem domains, including the 2D protein\nfolding problem, with up to (2^{25})*(3^{24}) coordinates, have been solved\nwith SAWs in less than 1,000,000 steps -- while also exceeding the quality of\nbest known solutions to date.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Sep 2013 21:52:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-01"}

By using this robust sample and by combining a\nself-consistent star formation model with various models for the distribution\nof time delays, the redshift distribution of SGRBs is calculated and then\ncompared to the observational data. Results. We find that the power-law delay\ndistribution model is disfavored and that only the lognormal delay distribution\nmodel with the typical delay tau >= 3 Gyr is consistent with the data.\nComparing Swift SGRBs with T90 > 0.8 s to our robust sample (T90 < 0.8 s), we\nfind a significant difference in the time delays between these two samples.\nConclusions. Our results show that the progenitors of SGRBs are dominated by\nrelatively long-lived systems (tau >= 3 Gyr), which contrasts the results found\nfor Type Ia supernovae. We therefore conclude that primordial NS-NS systems are\nnot favored as the dominant SGRB progenitors. Alternatively, dynamically formed\nNS-NS/BH and primordial NS-BH systems with average delays longer than 5 Gyr may\ncontribute a significant fraction to the overall SGRB progenitors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Sep 2013 02:16:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

The real and imaginary parts of a Schroedinger equation, however, are\nwell known to be precisely the dynamical equation pair of the real-valued\nclassical Hamiltonian functional which is numerically equal to the expectation\nvalue of that Schroedinger equation's Hermitian Hamiltonian operator. The\npurely real-valued second-order in time Euler-Lagrange equation of the\ncorresponding classical Lagrangian functional is also isomorphic to that\nSchroedinger equation, and for symmetric Hamiltonians has exactly the same\nformal appearance as the corresponding naive complex-valued Klein-Gordon\nequation, but none of the latter's extraneous solutions. These quantum\nSchroedinger-equation isomorphisms to classical Euler-Lagrange equations are\nthe technical manifestation of a key theoretical aspect of the principle of\ncomplementarity, one which is elegantly illustrated by the isomorphic\nfree-photon wave-function complement to the vector potential of source-free\nclassical electrodynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Sep 2013 09:26:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-01"}

The formalism is valid for all types of charged\nparticles and due to its closed nature is suited to provide fast conversion of\ndose to DNA-damage. Methods: The induction of double strand breaks in\nDNA--strings residing in irradiated cells is quantified using a single particle\nmodel. This leads to a proposal to use the cumulative Cauchy distribution to\nexpress the mix of high and low LET type damage probability generated by a\nsingle particle. A microscopic phenomenological Monte Carlo code is used to fit\nthe parameters of the model as a function of kinetic energy related to the\ndamage to a DNA molecule embedded in a cell. The model is applied for four\nparticles: electrons, protons, alpha--particles, and carbon ions. A geometric\ninterpretation of this observation using the impact ionization mean free path\nas a quantifier, allows extension of the model to very low energies. Results:\nThe mathematical expression describes the model adequately using a chi--square\ntest ($\\chi^2/NDF < 1$). This applies to all particle types with an almost\nperfect fit for protons, while the other particles seem to result in some\ndiscrepancies at very low energies. The implementation calculating a strict\nversion of the RBE based on complex damage alone is corroborated by\nexperimental data from the measured RBE. The geometric interpretation generates\na unique dimensionless parameter $k$ for each type of charged particle.

This\nis believed to be related to the formation of earth-like planets. This suggests\nthat twin stars have a radiative interior that is richer in heavy elements than\ntheir envelopes. Moreover, the current standard solar model does not fully\nagree with the helioseismology data and solar neutrino flux measurements. In\nthis work, we find that this agreement can improve if the Sun has mass loss\nduring the pre-main sequence, as was previously shown by other groups. Despite\nthis better agreement, the internal composition of the Sun is still uncertain,\nespecially for elements heavier than helium. With the goal of inferring the\nchemical abundance of the solar interior, we tested several chemical\ncompositions. We found that heavy element abundances influence the sound speed\nand solar neutrinos equally. Nevertheless, the carbon-nitrogen-oxygen (CNO;13N,\n15O and 17F) neutrino fluxes are the most affected; this is due to the fact\nthat contrarily to proton-proton (pp, pep, 8B and 7Be) neutrino fluxes, the CNO\nneutrino fluxes are less dependent on the total luminosity of the star.\nFurthermore, if the central solar metallicity increases by 30%, as hinted by\nthe solar twin stars observations, this new solar model predicts that 13N, 15O\nand 17F neutrino fluxes increase by 25%-80% relative to the standard solar\nmodel. Finally, we highlight that the next generation of solar neutrino\nexperiments will not only put constraints on the abundances of carbon, oxygen\nand nitrogen, but will also give some information about their radial\ndistribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Sep 2013 10:45:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-01"}
