At large magnetic fields, while the contribution of gauge\nfluctuations to Wilson-line potential remains unaltered at one-loop order, the\ncontribution of fermions effectively becomes two lower dimensional and is\nenhanced by the density of states of the lowest Landau level (LLL). In a\nspatial compactification and for heavy adjoint fermions, this enhancement leads\nto a calculable zero temperature quantum phase transition on R^3*S^1 driven by\na competition between the center-destabilizing gauge contribution and\ncenter-stabilizing LLL fermions. We also show that at a (formal) asymptotically\nlarge magnetic field, the adjoint fermions with arbitrarily large but fixed\nmass stabilize the center symmetry. This is an exotic case of simultaneous\nnon-decoupling of large mass fermions (due to the enhancement by the LLL\ndensity of states) and decoupling from the low energy effective field theory.\nThis observation has important implications for both Hosotani mechanism, for\nwhich gauge symmetry \"breaking\" occurs, and large-N volume independence\n(Eguchi-Kawai reduction), for which gauge structure is never \"broken\". Despite\nsounding almost self-contradictory, we carefully explain the physical scales\nentering the problem, double-meaning of unbroken center symmetry and how a\nclash is avoided.

A\nsimulation study typically starts with determining a collection of input\nvariables and their values on which the study depends, such as sample sizes,\ndimensions, types and degrees of dependence, estimation methods, etc.\nComputations are desired for all com- binations of these variables. If\nconducting these computations sequentially is too time- consuming, parallel\ncomputing can be applied over all combinations of select variables. The final\nresult object of a simulation study is typically an array. From this array,\nsum- mary statistics can be derived and presented in terms of (flat contingency\nor LATEX) tables or visualized in terms of (matrix-like) figures. The R package\nsimsalapar provides several tools to achieve the above tasks. Warnings and\nerrors are dealt with correctly, various seeding methods are available, and run\ntime is measured. Furthermore, tools for analyzing the results via tables or\ngraphics are pro- vided. In contrast to rather minimal examples typically found\nin R packages or vignettes, an end-to-end, not-so-minimal simulation problem\nfrom the realm of quantitative risk management is given. The concepts presented\nand solutions provided by simsalapar may be of interest to students,\nresearchers, and practitioners as a how-to for conducting real- istic,\nlarge-scale simulation studies in R. Also, the development of the package\nrevealed useful improvements to R itself, which are available in R 3.0.0.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Sep 2013 17:34:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-18"}

The goal is to find up to K sets from S that jointly cover (i.e.,\ninclude) as many elements as possible. This problem is well-known to be NP-hard\nand, under standard complexity-theoretic assumptions, the best possible\npolynomial-time approximation algorithm has approximation ratio (1 - 1/e).

For this case we show that there is an FPT approximation scheme\n(i.e., for each B there is a B-approximation algorithm running in FPT time) for\nthe problem of maximizing the number of covered elements, and a randomized FPT\napproximation scheme for the problem of minimizing the number of elements left\nuncovered (we take K to be the parameter). Then, for the case where there is a\nconstant p such that each element belongs to at least p sets from S, we show\nthat the standard greedy approximation algorithm achieves approximation ratio\nexactly (1-e^{-max(pK/|S|, 1)}). We conclude by considering an unrestricted\nvariant of MaxCover, and show approximation algorithms that run in exponential\ntime and combine an exact algorithm with a greedy approximation.

By considering the real Klein-Gordon field, we describe\nhow to model the non-uniform motion of a rigid cavity through spacetime. We\nemploy the use of Bogoliubov transformations to describe the effects of\nchanging acceleration. The second set of results investigate how the Dirac\nfield can be confined to a cavity for quantum information purposes. By again\nconsidering Bogoliubov transformations, we thoroughly investigate how the\nentanglement shared between two cavities is affected by non-uniform motion. It\nis shown that different types of Dirac field states are more robust against\nmotion than others. The final results look at using our second notion of\nlocalisation, Unruh- DeWitt detectors.

Using long-baseline interferometry,\nour goal is to determine accurate angular diameters of a number of roAp targets\nto provide a temperature calibration for these stars. We obtained\ninterferometric observations of 10 Aql with the visible spectrograph VEGA at\nthe CHARA array. We determined a limb-darkened angular diameter of\n0.275+/-0.009 mas and deduced a linear radius of 2.32+/-0.09 R_sun. We\nestimated the star's bolometric flux and used it, in combination with its\nparallax and angular diameter, to determine the star's luminosity and effective\ntemperature. For two data sets of bolometric flux we derived an effective\ntemperature of 7800+/-170 K and a luminosity of 18+/-1 L_sun or of 8000+/-210 K\nand 19+/-2 L_sun. We used these fundamental parameters together with the large\nfrequency separation to constrain the mass and the age of 10 Aql, using the\nCESAM stellar evolution code. Assuming a solar chemical composition and\nignoring all kinds of diffusion and settling of elements, we obtained a mass of\n1.92 M_sun and an age of 780 Gy or a mass of 1.95 M_sun and an age of 740 Gy,\ndepending on the considered bolometric flux. For the first time, we managed to\ndetermine an accurate angular diameter for a star smaller than 0.3 mas and to\nderive its fundamental parameters. In particular, by only combining our\ninterferometric data and the bolometric flux, we derived an effective\ntemperature that can be compared to those derived from atmosphere models. Such\nfundamental parameters can help for testing the mechanism responsible for the\nexcitation of the oscillations observed in the magnetic pulsating stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Sep 2013 18:45:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

When scaling up\nthe quantum registers in such devices, several challenges arise: individual\naddressing of qubits in a dense spectrum while suppressing crosstalk, creation\nof entanglement between distant nodes, and decoupling from unwanted\ninteractions. The experimental implementation of optimal control is a\nprerequisite to meeting these challenges. Using engineered microwave pulses, we\nexperimentally demonstrate optimal control of a prototype solid state spin\nqubit system comprising thirty six energy levels. The spin qubits are\nassociated with proximal nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. We\ndemonstrate precise single-electron spin qubit operations with an unprecedented\nfidelity F \\approx 0.99 in combination with high-efficiency storage of electron\nspin states in a nuclear spin quantum memory. Matching single-electron spin\noperations with spin-echo techniques, we further realize high-quality entangled\nstates (F > 0.82) between two electron spins on demand. After exploiting\noptimal control, the fidelity is mostly limited by the coherence time and\nimperfect initialization. Errors from crosstalk in a crowded spectrum of 8\nlines as well as detrimental effects from active dipolar couplings have been\nsimultaneously eliminated to unprecedented extent. Finally, by entanglement\nswapping to nuclear spins, nuclear spin entanglement over a length scale of 25\nnm is demonstrated.

These pockets of gravity can gravitate\nboth attractively or repulsively, since the Ricci tensor contains squared\npartial derivative terms with either positive or negative sign, so they can be\na component of either dark matter or dark energy. As the Universe expands the\ncurvature of the pockets weakens as 1/a^2, where a(t) is the scale factor of\nthe expansion, but it is shown that, as long as the integral over the\ngravitating gravitational fields of the pocket is done over all of the\nexpanding volume of the pocket, the value of the integral is not affected by\nthe expansion. Geometrically speaking, the gravitation of a pocket is produced\nby the convolutions of the metric inside it; as the Universe expands the\nconvolutions are over a much large volume so they are flatter, but an\nintegration over the larger volume gives the same result as before the\nexpansion.

The method, UPMASK, is aimed to be unsupervised, data\ndriven, model free, and to rely on as few assumptions as possible. It is based\non an iterative process, principal component analysis, clustering algorithm,\nand kernel density estimations. Moreover, it is able to take into account\narbitrary error models. An implementation in R was tested on simulated clusters\nthat covered a broad range of ages, masses, distances, reddenings, and also on\nreal data of cluster fields. Running UPMASK on simulations showed that it\neffectively separates cluster and field populations. The overall spatial\nstructure and distribution of cluster member stars in the colour-magnitude\ndiagram were recovered under a broad variety of conditions. For a set of 360\nsimulations, the resulting true positive rates (a measurement of purity) and\nmember recovery rates (a measurement of completeness) at the 90% membership\nprobability level reached high values for a range of open cluster ages\n($10^{7.1}-10^{9.5}$ yr), initial masses ($0.5-10\\times10^3$M$_{\\sun}$) and\nheliocentric distances ($0.5-4.0$ kpc).

Correlated materials often have remarkable\nproperties and transitions between distinct, competing phases with dramatically\ndifferent electronic and magnetic orders. These rich phenomena are fascinating\nfrom the basic science perspective and offer possibilities for technological\napplications.

To validate this\napproach, network simulator-2 (ns2) simulation is used to simulate the behavior\nof network with the supporting mathematical model. The main objective of this\nresearch is to remotely access different types of servers, laptops, desktops\nand other static and moving objects. This prototype is initially deployed to\ncontrol MSCS [13] & [14] from remote place through mobile devices. The\nprototype can further be enhanced to handle several objects simultaneously\nconsuming less energy and resources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Sep 2013 23:05:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-19"}

Here we take into account the effect of multiple interacting\nwaves by using an agent-based model in which the interaction between\ninformation waves is based on their novelty. We analyzed the global effects of\nsuch interactions and found that information that actually reaches nodes\nreaches them faster. This effect is caused by selection between information\nwaves: slow waves die out and only fast waves survive. As a result, and in\ncontrast to models with non-interacting information dynamics, the access to\ninformation decays with the distance from the source. Moreover, when we\nanalyzed the model on various synthetic and real spatial road networks, we\nfound that the decay rate also depends on the path redundancy and the effective\ndimension of the system. In general, the decay of the information wave\nfrequency as a function of distance from the source follows a power law\ndistribution with an exponent between -0.2 for a two-dimensional system with\nhigh path redundancy and -0.5 for a tree-like system with no path redundancy.\nWe found that the real spatial networks provide an infrastructure for\ninformation spreading that lies in between these two extremes. Finally, to\nbetter understand the mechanics behind the scaling results, we provide analytic\ncalculations of the scaling for a one-dimensional system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Sep 2013 08:46:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-29"}

Large slips occur intermittently after repeated small slips\nwhen the parameter of the velocity weakening friction is large. Small slips\nreduce the spatial irregularity of block displacement, and large slips occur on\na relatively flat configuration of blocks. Secondly, we study the effect of\nspatial heterogeneity such as asperity using percolation clusters. We show the\nnumerical results of the slip-size distribution in the block-spring model on\npercolation clusters, and find that the b parameter for the magnitude\ndistribution is close to 2/3 when the velocity weakening parameter is\nintermediate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Sep 2013 09:04:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

This work was carried out as part of the\nUniversity of Cambridge's Centre for Entrepreneurial Learning ETECH Project\nprogramme, designed to accelerate entrepreneurship and diffusion of innovations\nbased on early stage and potentially disruptive technologies from the\nUniversity. The axial flux machine design is assumed to utilise high\ntemperature superconductors in both wire (stator winding) and bulk (rotor\nfield) forms, to operate over a temperature range of 65-77 K, and to have a\npower output in the range from 10s of kW up to 1 MW (typical for axial flux\nmachines), with approximately 2-3 T as the peak trapped field in the bulk\nsuperconductors.

A\nstudy is also carried out on the machine's applicability as an in-wheel hub\nmotor for electric vehicles. Some recommendations for future applications are\nmade based on the outcome of these two studies. Next, the cost of YBCO-based\nsuperconducting (2G HTS) wire is analysed with respect to competing wire\ntechnologies and compared with current conventional material costs. Current\nwire costs for both 1G and 2G HTS are still too great to be economically\nfeasible for such superconducting devices, but round wire, so-called 3G HTS,\nconductors may be a promising new option with a view to the future.

We have rigorously calculated the\nground-state phase diagram, magnetization process, magnetocaloric effect and\nbasic thermodynamic quantities for the model, which can be alternatively viewed\nas an Ising-Heisenberg tetrahedral chain. It is demonstrated that a stepwise\nmagnetization curve with an intermediate plateau at a half of the saturation\nmagnetization is also reflected in respective stepwise changes of the\nconcurrence serving as a measure of bipartite entanglement. The ground-state\nphase diagram and zero-temperature magnetization curves of the Ising-Heisenberg\ntetrahedral chain are contrasted with the analogous results of the purely\nquantum Heisenberg tetrahedral chain, which have been obtained through\ndensity-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations.

Infinite constellations are the framework, proposed by Poltyrev, for\nanalyzing coded modulation codes. The Poltyrev's capacity, is the highest\nachievable normalized log density (NLD) of codewords per unit volume, at\npossibly large block length, that guarantees a vanishing error probability. For\na given finite block length and a fixed error probability, there is a gap\nbetween the highest achievable NLD and Poltyrev's capacity. The dispersion\nanalysis quantifies asymptotically this gap.\n  The thesis begins by the dispersion analysis of infinite constellations in\nscalar fading channels. Later on, we extend the analysis to the case of\nmultiple input multiple output fading channels. As in other channels, we show\nthat the gap between the highest achievable NLD and the Poltyrev's capacity,\nvanishes asymptotically as the square root of the channel dispersion over the\nblock length, multiplied by the inverse Q-function of the allowed error\nprobability.\n  Moreover, exact terms for Poltyrev's capacity and channel dispersion, are\nderived in the thesis. The relations to the amplitude and to the power\nconstrained fading channels are also discussed, especially in terms of\ncapacity, channel dispersion and error exponents. These relations hint that in\ntypical cases the unconstrained model can be interpreted as the limit of the\nconstrained model, when the signal to noise ratio tends to infinity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Sep 2013 13:19:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 5 Sep 2015 08:50:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-08"}

Our question is: which set\nsystems of a given size maximise the number of $(n+1)$-element chains in the\npower set $\\mathcal{P}(\\{1,2,\\dots,n\\})$? We will show that for each fixed\n$\\alpha>0$ there is a family of $\\alpha 2^n$ sets containing $(\\alpha+o(1))n!$\nsuch chains, and that this is asymptotically best possible. For smaller set\nsystems we are unable to answer the question. We conjecture that a `tower of\ncubes' construction is extremal. We finish by mentioning briefly a connection\nto an extremal problem on posets and a variant of our question for the grid\ngraph.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Sep 2013 13:47:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-20"}

Results from an empirical analysis are reported where\n23 change agents evaluated the relative level of importance of each dimension.\nEarly results indicate that change agents valued the process user satisfaction\nthe most and the process improvement fit the least.

We\nfocus on a peculiar conformal field theory (CFT), the one obtained by means of\nthe m-reduction technique, and stress its power in describing strongly\ncorrelated low dimensional condensed matter systems in the presence of\nlocalized impurities or topological defects. By exploiting the notion of Morita\nequivalence for field theories on noncommutative two-tori and choosing rational\nvalues of the noncommutativity parameter, we find a general one-to-one\ncorrespondence between the m-reduced conformal field theory describing the\nquantum Hall fluid and an Abelian noncommutative field theory. As an example of\napplication of the formalism, we study a quantum Hall bilayer at\nnonconventional fillings in the presence of a localized topological defect and\nbriefly recall its boundary state structure corresponding to two different\nboundary conditions, the periodic as well as the twisted boundary conditions\nrespectively, which give rise to different topological sectors on a torus. Then\nwe introduce generalized magnetic translation operators as tensor products,\nwhich act on the quantum Hall fluid and defect space respectively, and compute\ntheir action on the boundary partition functions: in this way their role as\nboundary condition changing operators is fully evidenced. From such results we\ninfer the general structure of generalized magnetic translations in our model\nand clarify the deep relation between noncommutativity and non-Abelian\nstatistics of quasi-hole excitations, which is crucial for physical\nimplementations of topological quantum computing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Sep 2013 15:37:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-19"}
