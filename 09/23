Those PDEs indeed show no dissipation effects and the\ninput of additional information in the model equations may introduce errors\nthat propagate and create shocks. We propose a new approach based on the\nkinetic description of the conservation law. A kinetic equation is a first\norder partial differential equation in which the advection velocity is a free\nvariable. In certain cases, it is possible to prove that the nonlinear\nconservation law is equivalent to a linear kinetic equation. Hence, data\nassimilation is carried out at the kinetic level, using a Luenberger observer\nalso known as the nudging strategy in data assimilation. Assimilation then\nresumes to the handling of a BGK type equation. The advantage of this framework\nis that we deal with a single \"linear\" equation instead of a nonlinear system\nand it is easy to recover the macroscopic variables. The study is divided into\nseveral steps and essentially based on functional analysis techniques.

The theory on which the technique is based is validated\nby laboratory experiments. Its outstanding principal advantages comes from the\nfact that the angular structure of an astronomical object is simply determined\nfrom the visibility of the minima of the spectrum of the intensity fluctuations\nmeasured by the detector, as a function of the frequency of the fluctuations,\nwhile keeping the spacing between mirrors constant. This would allow a simple\nsetup capable of high angular resolutions because it could use an extremely\nlarge baseline. Another major interest is that it allows for a more efficient\nuse of telescope time because observations at a single baseline are sufficient,\nwhile amplitude and intensity interferometers need several observations at\ndifferent baselines. The fact that one does not have to move the telescopes\nwould also allow detecting faster time variations because having to move the\ntelescopes sets a lower limit to the time variations that can be detected. The\ntechnique uses wave interaction effects and thus has some characteristics in\ncommon with intensity interferometry. A disadvantage of the technique, like in\nintensity interferometry, is that it needs strong sources if observing at high\nfrequencies (e.g. the visible). This is a minor disadvantage in the radio\nregion. At high frequencies, this disadvantage is mitigated by the fact that,\nlike in intensity interferometry, the requirements of the optical quality of\nthe mirrors used are far less severe than in amplitude interferometry so that\npoor quality large reflectors (e.g. Cherenkov telescopes) can be used in the\noptical region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Sep 2013 16:43:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-24"}

After\na first attempt to observe PV vibrational frequency shifts using sub-Doppler\nsaturated absorption spectroscopy in a cell, we are currently aiming at an\nexperiment based on Doppler-free two-photon Ramsey interferometry on a\nsupersonic beam. We report on our latest progress towards observing PV with\nchiral organo-metallic complexes containing a heavy rhenium atom.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Sep 2013 18:50:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

If a closed\nthree-dimensional boundary surface surrounding the fiducial volume of an\nexperiment can be defined such that its interior encloses no currents or\nsources of magnetization, each of the interior vector field components and the\nmagnetic scalar potential will satisfy a Laplace equation. Therefore, if either\nthe vector field components or the normal derivative of the scalar potential\ncan be measured on the surface of this boundary, thus defining a Dirichlet or\nNeumann boundary-value problem, respectively, the interior vector field\ncomponents or the scalar potential (and, thus, the field components via the\ngradient of the potential) can be uniquely determined via solution of the\nLaplace equation.

The\ncalculations adopt the local shearing box approximation, and utilize the\nrecently developed radiation transfer module in the Athena MHD code based on a\nvariable Eddington tensor rather than an assumed local closure. After\nsaturation of the MRI, in many cases the disk maintains a steady vertical\nstructure for many thermal times. However, in every case in which the box size\nin the horizontal directions is at least one pressure scale height,\nfluctuations associated with MRI turbulence and dynamo action in the disk\neventually trigger a thermal runaway which causes the disk to either expand or\ncontract until the calculation must be terminated. During runaway, the\ndependence of the heating and cooling rates on total pressure satisfy the\nsimplest criterion for classical thermal instability. We identify several\nphysical reasons why the thermal runaway observed in our simulations differ\nfrom the standard alpha disk model, for example the advection of radiation\ncontributes a non-negligible fraction to the vertical energy flux at the\nlargest radiation pressure, most of the dissipation does not happen in the disk\nmid-plane, and the change of dissipation scale height with mid-plane pressure\nis slower than the change of density scale height.

We phrase\nthe ideas in terms of rank condensers and Wronskians, and show that our results\nimprove upon the classical multivariate Wronskian, which may be of independent\ninterest.\n  In addition, we give the first n^(lglg n) black-box polynomial identity\ntesting algorithm for the so called model of diagonal circuits. This model,\nintroduced by Saxena has recently found applications in the work of Mulmuley,\nas well as in the work of Gupta, Kamath, Kayal, Saptharishi. Previously work\nhad given n^(lg n)-time algorithms for this class. More generally, our result\nholds for any model computing polynomials whose partial derivatives (of all\norders) span a low dimensional linear space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Sep 2013 23:56:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-24"}

This had as\nconsequence the necessity to take into consideration a modified sigmoid\nactivation function for neurons in the first hidden layer (in agreement with a\nspecific MLP apartment structure), and also a modified version of the\nBackpropagation algorithm, which allows using of unspecified (null) desired\noutput components.

One is the intrinsic\nheterogeneity of a paper determined by the impact factor of the journal\npublishing it. The other is the mechanism of a paper being cited which depends\non its citations and prestige. We develop a model for citation networks via an\nintrinsic nodal weight function and an intuitive ageing mechanism. The node's\nweight is drawn from the distribution of impact factors of journals and the\nageing transition is a function of the citation and the prestige. The\nnode-degree distribution of resulting networks shows nonuniversal scaling: the\ndistribution decays exponentially for small degree and has a power-law tail for\nlarge degree, hence the dual behaviour. The higher the impact factor of the\njournal, the larger the tipping point and the smaller the power exponent that\nare obtained. With the increase of the journal rank, this phenomenon will fade\nand evolve to pure power laws.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Sep 2013 01:41:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Jan 2014 02:04:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 9 May 2014 02:17:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-12"}

Popular examples are the\nantiferromagnetic (AFM) and the ferromagnetic (FM) phases in the\nthree-component atomic condensate with effective spin-1, to which different\ntopological manifolds can be assigned. It follows, from consideration of\nhomotopy, that different sorts of topological defects will be stable in each\nmanifold. For instance, Skyrmionic texture is believed to be a stable\ntopological object in two-dimensional AFM spin-1 condensate. Countering such\ncommon perceptions, here we show on the basis of a new wave function\ndecomposition scheme that there is no physical parameter regime wherein the\ntemporal dynamics of spin-1 condensate can be described solely within AFM or FM\nmanifold. Initial state of definite topological number prepared entirely within\none particular phase must immediately evolve into a mixed state. Accordingly,\nthe very notion of topology and topological stability within the sub-manifold\nof AFM or FM become invalid. Numerical simulation reveals the linear Zeeman\neffect to be an efficient catalyst to extract the alternate component from an\ninitial topological object prepared entirely within one particular\nsub-manifold, serving as a potential new tool for \"topology engineering\" in\nmulti-component Bose-Einstein condensates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Sep 2013 02:21:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-29"}

We restrict to transmitter scheduling policies\nthat are monotone and stationary, i.e., the number of packets served is a\nnon-decreasing function of the queue length at the beginning of the slot for\nevery slot fade state. For such policies, we obtain asymptotic lower bounds for\nthe minimum average delay of the packets, when average transmitter power is a\nsmall positive quantity $V$ more than the minimum average power required for\ntransmitter queue stability. We show that the minimum average delay grows\neither to a finite value or as $\\Omega\\brap{\\log(1/V)}$ or $\\Omega\\brap{1/V}$\nwhen $V \\downarrow 0$, for certain sets of values of $\\lambda$.

The first method called FLens integrates an\ninpainting concept to invert the shear field with possible gaps, and a\nmulti-scale entropy denoising procedure to remove the noise contained in the\nfinal reconstruction, that arises mostly from the random intrinsic shape of the\ngalaxies. The second and third methods are based on a model of the density\nfield made of a multi-scale grid of radial basis functions. In one case, the\nmodel parameters are computed with a linear inversion involving a singular\nvalue decomposition. In the other case, the model parameters are estimated\nusing a Bayesian MCMC optimization implemented in the lensing software\nLenstool. Methods are compared on simulated data with varying galaxy density\nfields. We pay particular attention to the errors estimated with resampling.

Jet radio\nemission is expected from a sub-Eddington accreting IMBH in the low/hard (radio\nbright) state. In a search for such IMBH jet radio emission, we have observed\nwith the Very Large Array (VLA) at 5 GHz a sample of seven extreme ULXs whose\nX-ray properties indicate they are in the hard state. Assuming they remain in\nthis state, the non-detection of radio emission for six of the target sources\nallows us to constrain their black hole mass to the IMBH regime, thus ruling\nout a supermassive black hole nature. For the extreme ULX in the galaxy\nNGC\\,2276, we detect extended radio emission formed by two lobes of total flux\ndensity 1.43 $\\pm$ 0.22 mJy and size $\\sim$650 pc. The X-ray counterpart is\nlocated between the two lobes, suggesting the presence of a black hole with jet\nradio emission. The radio luminosity allows us to constrain the black hole mass\nof this source to the IMBH regime; hence, the extreme ULX in NGC\\,2276 could be\nthe first detection of extended jet radio emission from an IMBH.

Due to the elimination of the most uncertain twist-3 contribution and\nthe large suppression of the twist-4 contribution, the obtained LCSR shall\nprovide us a good platform for testing the $D$-meson leading-twist DA.

Corrections for such\ninteractions are particularly important for observations of rare secondary\nparticles such as boron, antiprotons and positrons. These corrections can\neither be calculated if the relevant cross sections in the atmosphere are\nknown, or may be empirically determined by extrapolation of the \"growth\ncurves\", i. e. the individual particle intensities as functions of atmospheric\ndepth. The growth-curve technique is particularly attractive for long-duration\nballoon flights where the periodic daily altitude variations permit rather\nprecise determinations of the corresponding particle intensity variations. We\ndetermine growth curves for nuclei from boron (Z=5) to iron (Z=26), using data\nfrom the 2006 Arctic balloon flight of the TRACER detector for cosmic-ray\nnuclei, and we compare the growth curves with predictions from published cross\nsection values. In general, good agreement is observed. We then study the\nboron/carbon abundance ratio and derive a simple and energy-independent\ncorrection term for this ratio. We emphasize that the growth-curve technique\ncan be developed further to provide highly accurate tests of published\ninteraction cross section values.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Sep 2013 09:35:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-12"}

We consider a finite atomic\nchain which is coupled to a zero-temperature outer environment, modeled as two\nadditional semi-infinite chains, thus inducing \"clamping-losses\". Weak coupling\nto the outer environment ensures that the clamping losses are small, and that\nthe initially discrete nature of the phonon spectrum is approximately\nmaintained. We then consider a phonon damping process known as \"Landau-Rumer\ndamping\", where phonons in the excited mode of vibration decay into other modes\nthrough anharmonic phonon-phonon interaction. The approximately discrete nature\nof the phonon spectrum leads to sharp nonmonotonic changes in Q as parameters\nare varied, and to the appearance of resonances in the damping. The latter\ncorrespond to the existence of decay processes where the participating phonons\napproximately conserve energy.

The present study aims at putting\nconstraints on the degree of 15N-fractionation that occurs during the\nprestellar phase, through observations of D, 13C and 15N-substituted\nisotopologues towards B1b. Both molecules from the nitrogen hydride family,\ni.e. N2H+ and NH3, and from the nitrile family, i.e. HCN, HNC and CN, are\nconsidered in the analysis. As a first step, we model the continuum emission in\norder to derive the physical structure of the cloud, i.e. gas temperature and\nH2 density. These parameters are subsequently used as an input in a non-local\nradiative transfer model to infer the radial abundances profiles of the various\nmolecules. Our modeling shows that all the molecules are affected by depletion\nonto dust grains, in the region that encompasses the B1-bS and B1-bN cores.\nWhile high levels of deuterium fractionation are derived, we conclude that no\nfractionation occurs in the case of the nitrogen chemistry. Independently of\nthe chemical family, the molecular abundances are consistent with 14N/15N~300,\na value representative of the elemental atomic abundances of the parental gas.\nThe inefficiency of the 15N-fractionation effects in the B1b region can be\nlinked to the relatively high gas temperature ~17K which is representative of\nthe innermost part of the cloud. Since this region shows signs of depletion\nonto dust grains, we can not exclude the possibility that the molecules were\npreviously enriched in 15N, earlier in the B1b history, and that such an\nenrichment could have been incorporated into the ice mantles. It is thus\nnecessary to repeat this kind of study in colder sources to test such a\npossibility.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Sep 2013 12:11:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

We introduce a new formal model for the problem of online VM\nmigration in two scenarios: (1) VMs can be migrated arbitrarily in the\nsubstrate network; e.g., a private cloud provider may have an incentive to\nreduce the overall communication cost in the network. (2) VMs can only be\nmigrated within a given tenant; e.g., a user that was assigned a set of\nphysical machines may exchange the functionality of the VMs on these machines.\n  We propose a simple class of Destination-Swap algorithms which are based on\nan aggressive collocation strategy (inspired by splay datastructures) and which\nmaintain a minimal and local amount of per-node (amortized cost) information to\ndecide where to migrate a VM and how; thus, the algorithms react quickly to\nchanges in the load. The algorithms come in two main flavors, an indirect and\ndistributed variant which keeps existing VM placements local, and a direct\nvariant which keeps the number of affected VMs small.\n  We show that naturally, inter-tenant optimizations yield a larger potential\nfor optimization, but generally also a tenant itself can improve its embedding.\nMoreover, there exists an interesting tradeoff between direct and indirect\nstrategies: indirect variants are preferable under skewed and sparse\ncommunication patterns due to their locality properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Sep 2013 14:43:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-24"}

We have analyzed the 300-2500 nm X-shooter spectra of two jets\ndriven by the pre-main sequence stars ESO-Halpha 574 and Par-Lup 3-4. Both\nspectra are very rich in [FeII] lines over the whole spectral range; in\naddition, lines from [FeIII] are detected in the ESO-H\\alpha 574 spectrum.
