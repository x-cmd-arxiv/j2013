This efficient and robust machine learning tool is\nable to train large and deep feed-forward neural networks, including\nautoencoders, for use in a wide range of supervised and unsupervised learning\napplications, such as regression, classification, density estimation,\nclustering and dimensionality reduction. SkyNet uses a `pre-training' method to\nobtain a set of network parameters that has empirically been shown to be close\nto a good solution, followed by further optimisation using a regularised\nvariant of Newton's method, where the level of regularisation is determined and\nadjusted automatically; the latter uses second-order derivative information to\nimprove convergence, but without the need to evaluate or store the full Hessian\nmatrix, by using a fast approximate method to calculate Hessian-vector\nproducts. This combination of methods allows for the training of complicated\nnetworks that are difficult to optimise using standard backpropagation\ntechniques. SkyNet employs convergence criteria that naturally prevent\noverfitting, and also includes a fast algorithm for estimating the accuracy of\nnetwork outputs. The utility and flexibility of SkyNet are demonstrated by\napplication to a number of toy problems, and to astronomical problems focusing\non the recovery of structure from blurred and noisy images, the identification\nof gamma-ray bursters, and the compression and denoising of galaxy images.

One of the challenges of identifying reliable\nDDIs is domain promiscuity. Promiscuous domains are domains that can occur in\nmany domain architectures and are therefore found in many proteins. This\nbecomes a problem for a method where the score of a domain-pair is the ratio\nbetween observed and expected frequencies because the PPI network is sparse. As\nsuch, many protein-pairs will be non-interacting and domain-pairs with\npromiscuous domains will be penalized.

We thereby measure dynamically the mass of the Galactic stellar\ndisk to unprecedented accuracy: M_* = 4.6+/-0.3+3.0x(R_0/kpc-8)x10^{10}Msun and\na total local surface density of \\Sigma_{R_0}(Z=1.1 kpc) = 68+/-4 Msun/pc^2 of\nwhich 38+/-4 Msun/pc^2 is contributed by stars and stellar remnants. By\ncombining our surface density measurements with the terminal velocity curve, we\nfind that the MW's disk is maximal in that V_{c,disk} / V_{c,total} =\n0.83+/-0.04 at R=2.2 R_d.

We derive their mass\ndistributions for a range of model isochrones, varying distances, extinction\nlaws and ages, with comprehensive assessments of the uncertainties. We find\nthat the choice of isochrone and other parameters have significant effects on\nthe results, thus we caution against comparing IMFs obtained using different\napproaches.

Current\nindustrial 3D-printing capabilities are briefly reviewed and contrasted with\ncapabilities desired for printing detectors for particle physics, with\nmicro-pattern gaseous detectors used as a first example. A significant impact\non industrial technology could be expected if HEP were to partner with industry\nin taking on such a challenge.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Sep 2013 20:52:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 Sep 2013 16:45:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-06"}

Our\nwork characterizes this trade-off from a cross-layer perspective, specifically\nby showing how the slope of ADC/DAC power consumption versus sampling rate\ncurve influences scheduling decisions in a multi-hop network. Specifically, we\nprovide a branch and bound algorithm based mixed integer linear programming\nsolution that performs joint power control, spectrum span selection, scheduling\nand routing in order to minimize the system power of multi-hop NC-OFDMA\nnetworks. We also provide a low complexity (O(E^2 M^2)) greedy algorithm where\nM and E denote the number of channels and links respectively. Numerical\nsimulations suggest that our approach reduces system power by 30% over\nclassical transmit power minimization based cross-layer algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Sep 2013 23:14:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 8 Aug 2014 18:33:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 15 Feb 2016 03:51:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-16"}

A classical question in formal\nmodelling with clear relevance to biological modelling is the model checking\nproblem. i.e. calculate the probability that a behaviour, expressed for\ninstance in terms of a certain temporal logic formula, may occur in a given\nstochastic process. However, one may not only be interested in the notion of\nsatisfiability, but also in the capacity of a system to mantain a particular\nemergent behaviour unaffected by the perturbations, caused e.g. from extrinsic\nnoise, or by possible small changes in the model parameters. To address this\nissue, researchers from the verification community have recently proposed\nseveral notions of robustness for temporal logic providing suitable definitions\nof distance between a trajectory of a (deterministic) dynamical system and the\nboundaries of the set of trajectories satisfying the property of interest. The\ncontributions of this paper are twofold. First, we extend the notion of\nrobustness to stochastic systems, showing that this naturally leads to a\ndistribution of robustness scores.

Different field excitations see\na different effective metric and hence a different light cone. In these\ntheories, although one can define the Killing horizon in a conventional way,\nthis definition does not capture the notion of a black hole. This is so because\nthere exist modes which see a wider light cone than the one defined by the\nKilling Horizon and therefore can escape to infinity. However, there exist\nsolutions of these theories which admit a special spacelike hypersurface which\nacts as a one-way membrane.

In this sense this\nhypersurface acts like a black-hole horizon and is called the Universal Horizon\nbecause it traps modes travelling with arbitrarily high velocities.

The translation speed can vary from one codon to another, thus there is\nroom for changing the ribosome speed while keeping the amino acid sequence and\nhence the resulting protein. Recently, it has been noticed that the choice of\nthe synonymous codon, via the resulting distribution of slow- and\nfast-translated codons, affects not only on the average speed of one ribosome\ntranslating the messenger RNA (mRNA) but also might have an effect on nearby\nribosomes by affecting the appearance of \"traffic jams\" where multiple\nribosomes collide and form queues. To test this \"context effect\" further, we\nhere investigate the effect of the sequence of synonymous codons on the\nribosome traffic by using a ribosome traffic model with codon-dependent rates,\nestimated from experiments. We compare the ribosome traffic on wild type\nsequences and sequences where the synonymous codons were swapped randomly. By\nsimulating translation of 87 genes, we demonstrate that the wild type\nsequences, especially those with a high bias in codon usage, tend to have the\nability to reduce ribosome collisions, hence optimizing the cellular investment\nin the translation apparatus. The magnitude of such reduction of the\ntranslation time might have a significant impact on the cellular growth rate\nand thereby have importance for the survival of the species.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Sep 2013 08:05:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-10"}

For this reason it is possible to access the\nsmaller ones, which is more difficult to do with the TNO population. The goal\nof this work is to characterize a set of 16 Centaurs in terms of their size,\nalbedo, and thermal properties. We study the correlations, for a more extended\nsample obtained from the literature, of diameter, albedo, orbital parameters,\nand spectral slopes. We performed three-band photometric observations using\nHerschel-PACS and used a consistent method for the data reduction and aperture\nphotometry of this sample to obtain monochromatic flux densities at 70, 100,\nand 160 $\\mu$m. Additionally, we used Spitzer-MIPS flux densities at 24 and 70\n$\\mu$m when available. We also included in our Centaur sample scattered disk\nobjects (SDOs), a dynamical family of TNOS, using results previously published\nby our team, and some Centaurs observed only with the Spitzer/MIPS instrument.\nWe have determined new radiometric sizes and albedos of 16 Centaurs. The first\nconclusion is that the albedos of Centaur objects are not correlated with their\norbital parameters. Similarly, there is no correlation between diameter and\norbital parameters. Most of the objects in our sample are dark (pv < 7%) and\nmost of them are small (D < 120km). However, there is no correlation between\nalbedo and diameter, in particular for the group of the small objects as albedo\nvalues are homogeneously distributed between 4 to 16%. The correlation with the\ncolor of the objects showed that red objects are all small (mean diameter 65\nkm), while the gray ones span a wide range of sizes (mean diameter 120 km).\nMoreover, the gray objects tend to be darker, with a mean albedo of 5.6%,\ncompared with a mean of 8.5% (ranging from 5 to 15%) for the red objects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Sep 2013 08:41:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Oct 2013 15:24:16 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 5 Mar 2014 12:38:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

In these collapsars, massive\nstars undergo core collapse to form a proto-neutron star initially and a mild\nsupernova explosion is driven. The supernova ejecta lack momentum and\nsubsequently this newly formed neutron star gets transformed to a stellar mass\nblack hole via massive fallback. The hydrodynamics and the nucleosynthesis in\nthese accretion disks has been studied extensively in the past. Several heavy\nelements are synthesized in the disk and much of these heavy elements are\nejected from the disk via winds and outflows. We study nucleosynthesis in the\noutflows launched from these disks by using an adiabatic, spherically expanding\noutflow model, to understand which of these elements thus synthesized in the\ndisk survive in the outflow. While studying this we find that many new elements\nlike isotopes of titanium, copper, zinc etc. are present in the outflows. 56Ni\nis abundantly synthesized in most of the cases in the outflow which implies\nthat the outflows from these disks in a majority of cases will lead to an\nobservable supernova explosion. It is mainly present when outflow is considered\nfrom the He-rich, 56Ni/54Fe rich zones of the disks. However, outflow from the\nSi-rich zone of the disk remains rich in silicon. Although, emission lines of\nmany of these heavy elements have been observed in the X-ray afterglows of\nseveral GRBs by Chandra, BeppoSAX, XMM-Newton etc., Swift seems to have not\ndetected these lines yet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Sep 2013 09:38:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-13"}

We identify two possibilities\nfor the projection, on-shell and off-shell projection. For all $j$ except for\n$j=1/2$, we find that the projection does not completely fix the properties of\nthe interacting theory. This freedom is related to the fact that the covariant\nform of parity can be written in terms of one of the symmetric traceless\ntensors in the covariant basis and in general allows for a free magnetic dipole\nterm in the lagrangian. We gauge the theory and construct the charge\nconjugation operator. In the case of bosons, the parity invariant subspaces are\nalso invariant under charge conjugation and time reversal and the formulation\nof a quantum field theory can be done using only these subspaces. As a first\nexhaustive example we work out the electrodynamics for $j=1$ matter bosons,\nrewrite the theory in terms of an antisymmetric tensor field and compare our\nresults with existing formalisms in the literature. We find that there are\nthree essentially different formalisms: i) formalisms equivalent to the\non-shell parity projection, ii) formalisms equivalent to the off-shell parity\nprojection and iii) the Poincar\\'e projector formalism which describes a\ndegenerate parity doublet. We perform a chiral decomposition of these theories\nand show that chiral symmetry can be realized linearly only for the theory\nbased on the on-shell projection.

The elliptical galaxy NGC 3923 is surrounded by numerous stellar\nshells that are concentric arcs centered on the galactic core. They are very\nlikely a result of a minor merger and they consist of stars in nearly radial\norbits. For a given potential, the shell radii at a given time after the merger\ncan be calculated and compared to observations. The Modified Newtonian Dynamics\n(MOND) is a theory that aims to solve the missing mass problem by modifying the\nlaws of classical dynamics in the limit of small accelerations. Hernquist &\nQuinn(1987) claimed that the shell distribution of NGC 3923 contradicted MOND,\nbut Milgrom(1988) found several substantial insufficiencies in their work.\n  Aims. We test whether the observed shell distribution in NGC 3923 is\nconsistent with MOND using the current observational knowledge of the shell\nnumber and positions and of the host galaxy surface brightness profile, which\nsupersede the data available in the 1980s when the last (and negative) tests of\nMOND viability were performed on NGC 3923.\n  Methods. Using the 3.6 um bandpass image of NGC 3923 from the Spitzer space\ntelescope we construct the mass profile of the galaxy. The evolution of shell\nradii in MOND is then computed using analytical formulae. We use 27 currently\nobserved shells and allow for their multi-generation formation, unlike the\nHernquist & Quinn one-generation model that used the 18 shells known at the\ntime.\n  Results. Our model reproduces the observed shell radii with a maximum\ndeviation of 5% for 25 out of 27 known shells while keeping a reasonable\nformation scenario. A multi-generation nature of the shell system, resulting\nfrom successive passages of the surviving core of the tidally disrupted dwarf\ngalaxy, is one of key ingredients of our scenario supported by the extreme\nshell radial range. The 25 reproduced shells are interpreted as belonging to\nthree generations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Sep 2013 12:31:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Sep 2013 10:39:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

Wavelet transform is a good tool to analyze multi-scale,\nmulti-direction changes of texture. Local binary patterns (LBP) are a type of\nfeature used for classification in computer vision. Firstly, human thermal IR\nface image is preprocessed and cropped the face region only from the entire\nimage. Secondly, two different approaches are used to extract the features from\nthe cropped face region.

Then a\ntotal confidence matrix is formed for each face image by taking a weighted sum\nof the corresponding pixel values of the LL band and average band. For LBP\nfeature extraction, each of the face images in training and test datasets is\ndivided into 161 numbers of sub images, each of size 8X8 pixels. For each such\nsub images, LBP features are extracted which are concatenated in row wise\nmanner. PCA is performed separately on the individual feature set for\ndimensionality reeducation.

We discuss the presence of\nregular patterns in the distribution of multiple periodicities and amplitudes.\nIn the period-amplitude plane we find that it is possible to distinguish\nbetween solar-like oscillations and larger amplitude pulsations which are\ncharacteristic for Mira/SR stars.

Using\nthe Plateau de Bure Interferometer in its most extended configuration at 843mum\nwavelength, we achieved a spatial resolution of 0.2\"x0.17\", corresponding to\n~500AU at a distance of 2.7\\,kpc. Results: For the first time, we have observed\nthe fragmentation of the dense inner core of this region with at least three\nsubsources within the inner 3000 AU. The outflow exhibits blue- and red-shifted\nemission on both sides of the central source indicating that the current\norientation has to be close to the line-of-sight, which differs from other\nrecent models. We observe rotational signatures in northeast-southwest\ndirection; however, even on scales of 500 AU, we do not identify any Keplerian\nrotation signatures. This implies that during the early evolutionary stages any\nstable Keplerian inner disk has to be very small (<=500 AU). The high-energy\nline HCN(4-3)v2=1 (E_u/k=1050K) is detected over an extent of approximately\n3000 AU.

We consider the stage of evolution after\nthe planet has cleared-out a gap, so that the planetary orbit evolves only\nunder the gravitational potential from the disc. We develop a secular analysis\nand compute the evolution of the orbital elements by solving Lagrange's\nequations valid to second order in the eccentricity. We also perform numerical\nsimulations with the full disc potential. In general, the interaction between\nthe disc and the planet leads to the precession of the orbit. The orbital plane\ntherefore becomes tilted relative to the disc's inner parts, with no change in\nthe eccentricity. When the inclination approaches 90 degrees, there is an\ninstability and the eccentricity increases. In this case, both the inclination\nand the eccentricity develop large variations, with the orbit becoming\nretrograde. As the eccentricity reaches high values, we would expect tidal\ncapture on a short orbit of the planet by the star to occur. This instability\nhappens when the disc is severely warped, or if there is a significant amount\nof mass in a ring inclined by at least 45 degrees relative to the initial\norbital plane. The inclination of the orbit does not depend on the semimajor\naxis nor on the planet's mass. However, for a significant inclination to be\ngenerated on a timescale of at most a few Myr, the planet should be beyond the\nsnow line.

The one-level scaling\ndensity for the first family corresponds to the orthogonal distribution as\npredicted by the conjectures of Katz and Sarnak, and the one-level scaling\ndensity for the second family is the sum of the Dirac distribution and the even\northogonal distribution. This seems to be a new phenomenon, caused by the fact\nthat the curves of the second families have odd rank.

We\nanalyze the influence of the phonon environment on the spectrum by calculating\nthe line shape of the various optical transitions including contributions due\nto both pure dephasing and phonon-induced transitions between different exciton\nstates. The line width enhancement due to phonon-induced transitions is\nparticularly pronounced in the region of an anticrossing and it strongly\ndepends on the energy splitting between the two exciton branches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Sep 2013 13:57:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 Nov 2013 13:04:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-22"}

Certain microscopic swimmers have been shown to progress more\nrapidly through shear-thinning fluids, but is this behavior generic to all\nmicroscopic swimmers, and what are the physics through which shear-thinning\nrheology affects a swimmer's propulsion? We examine swimmers employing\nprescribed stroke kinematics in two-dimensional, inertialess Carreau fluid:\nshear-thinning \"Generalized Stokes\" flow. Swimmers are modeled, using the\nmethod of femlets, by a set of immersed, regularized forces. The equations\ngoverning the fluid dynamics are then discretized over a body-fitted mesh and\nsolved with the finite element method. We analyze the locomotion of three\ndistinct classes of microswimmer: (1) conceptual swimmers comprising sliding\nspheres employing both one- and two-dimensional strokes, (2) slip-velocity\nenvelope models of ciliates commonly referred to as \"squirmers\" and (3)\nmonoflagellate pushers, such as sperm. We find that morphologically identical\nswimmers with different strokes may swim either faster or slower in\nshear-thinning fluids than in Newtonian fluids. We explain this kinematic\nsensitivity by considering differences in the viscosity of the fluid\nsurrounding propulsive and payload elements of the swimmer, and using this\ninsight suggest two reciprocal sliding sphere swimmers which violate Purcell's\nScallop theorem in shear-thinning fluids. We also show that an increased flow\ndecay rate arising from shear-thinning rheology is associated with a reduction\nin the swimming speed of slip-velocity squirmers.

We review\nthe mechanics of viscous-dominated microscale flow, including time-reversal\nsymmetry, drag anisotropy of slender bodies, and wall effects. We focus on the\nfundamental force singularity, higher order multipoles, and the method of\nimages, providing physical insight and forming a basis for computational\napproaches. Two biological problems are then considered in more detail: (1)\nleft-right symmetry breaking flow in the node, a microscopic structure in\ndeveloping vertebrate embryos, and (2) motility of microswimmers through\nnon-Newtonian fluids. Our model of the embryonic node reveals how particle\ntransport associated with morphogenesis is modulated by the gradual emergence\nof cilium posterior tilt. Our model of swimming makes use of force\ndistributions within a body-conforming finite element framework, allowing the\nsolution of nonlinear inertialess Carreau flow. We find that a three-sphere\nmodel swimmer and a model sperm are similarly affected by shear-thinning; in\nboth cases swimming due to a prescribed beat is enhanced by shear-thinning,\nwith optimal Deborah number around 0.8. The sperm exhibits an almost perfect\nlinear relationship between velocity and the logarithm of the ratio of zero to\ninfinite shear viscosity, with shear-thickening hindering cell progress.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Sep 2013 15:42:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-06"}

An object\ndetector accepts an image and produces a list of locations as $(x,y)$ pairs.\nHere we introduce a new concept: {\\bf location-based boosting}. Location-based\nboosting differs from previous boosting algorithms because it optimizes a new\nspatial loss function to combine object detectors, each of which may have\nmarginal performance, into a single, more accurate object detector. A\nstructured representation of object locations as a list of $(x,y)$ pairs is a\nmore natural domain for object detection than the spatially unstructured\nrepresentation produced by classifiers. Furthermore, this formulation allows us\nto take advantage of the intuition that large areas of the background are\nuninteresting and it is not worth expending computational effort on them. This\nresults in a more scalable algorithm because it does not need to take measures\nto prevent the background data from swamping the foreground data such as\nsubsampling or applying an ad-hoc weighting to the pixels.

Sterile modifications to the flux and changes to the cross section in the\nsimulation relate the two and allow limits to be set on sterile neutrino mixing\nusing cross section results. The large axial mass problem makes it necessary\nfor experiments to perform their own axial mass fits, but a prior fit to the\nsame dataset could mask a sterile oscillation signal if the sterile and cross\nsection model parameters are not independent.

Objects\nliving or non-living emit different amounts of IR energy according to their\nbody temperature and characteristics. Humans are homoeothermic and hence\ncapable of maintaining constant temperature under different surrounding\ntemperature. Face recognition from thermal (IR) images should focus on changes\nof temperature on facial blood vessels. These temperature changes can be\nregarded as texture features of images and wavelet transform is a very good\ntool to analyze multi-scale and multi-directional texture. Wavelet transform is\nalso used for image dimensionality reduction, by removing redundancies and\npreserving original features of the image. The sizes of the facial images are\nnormally large. So, the wavelet transform is used before image similarity is\nmeasured. Therefore this paper describes an efficient approach of human face\nrecognition based on wavelet transform from thermal IR images. The system\nconsists of three steps. At the very first step, human thermal IR face image is\npreprocessed and the face region is only cropped from the entire image.\nSecondly, Haar wavelet is used to extract low frequency band from the cropped\nface region. Lastly, the image classification between the training images and\nthe test images is done, which is based on low-frequency components. The\nproposed approach is tested on a number of human thermal infrared face images\ncreated at our own laboratory and Terravic Facial IR Database. Experimental\nresults indicated that the thermal infra red face images can be recognized by\nthe proposed system effectively. The maximum success of 95% recognition has\nbeen achieved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Sep 2013 13:45:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-06"}
