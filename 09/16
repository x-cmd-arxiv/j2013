Policies based on \"debt,\" called maximum debt first\npolicies (MDF) were introduced, and shown to be throughput optimal. By\n\"throughput optimality\" it is meant that if there exists a policy that fulfils\na set of clients with a given vector of delivery ratios and a vector of channel\nreliabilities, then the MDF policy will also fulfill them. The debt of a user\nis the difference between the number of packets that should have been delivered\nso as to meet the delivery ratio and the number of packets that have been\ndelivered for that client. The maximum debt first (MDF) prioritizes the clients\nin decreasing order of debts at the beginning of every period. Note that a\nthroughput optimal policy only guarantees that \\begin{small} $\\liminf_{T \\to\n\\infty} \\frac{1}{T}\\sum_{t=1}^{T} \\mathbbm{1}\\{\\{client $n$'s packet is\ndelivered in frame $t$} \\} \\geq q_{i}$ \\end{small}, where the right hand side\nis the required delivery ratio for client $i$. Thus, it only guarantees that\nthe debts of each user are $o(T)$, and can be otherwise arbitrarily large. This\nraises the interesting question about what is the growth rate of the debts\nunder the MDF policy. We show the optimality of MDF policy in the case when the\nchannel reliabilities of all users are same, and obtain performance bounds for\nthe general case. For the performance bound we obtain the almost sure bounds on\n$\\limsup_{t\\to\\infty}\\frac{d_{i}(t)}{\\phi(t)}$ for all $i$, where $\\phi(t) =\n\\sqrt{2t\\log\\log t}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Sep 2013 21:33:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-17"}

To gain\nnew theoretical insights into the behavior of hypervolume-based algorithms we\ncompare their optimization goal to the goal of achieving an optimal\nmultiplicative approximation ratio. Our studies are carried out for different\nPareto front shapes of bi-objective problems.

The caustic formation rate is high when the particle inertia\nbecomes large, and we find that caustics dominate the collision rate as soon as\nthey form frequently.

In an out-of-plane field, the nuclear spins play a\nmore important role due selection rules imposed on the spin-orbit couplings.\nOur theory shows a very good agreement with data measured in [Srinivasa, et\nal., PRL 110, 196803 (2013)], allowing us to extract information on the linear\nspin-orbit interactions strengths in that experiment.

This interpolation method\nrequires that the probability distribution of all random input variables is\nknown a priori, which is often not the case in industrially relevant\napplications. Additionally, this method suffers from a curse of dimensionality,\ni.e., the number of deterministic PDEs to be solved grows exponentially with\nrespect to the number of random variables. This paper presents an alternative\ninterpolation method, based on a radial basis function (RBF) metamodel, to\ncompute statistics of the stochastic PDE. The RBF metamodel can be constructed\neven if the probability distribution of all random variables is not known.\nThen, a lot of statistic scenarios with different probability distributions of\nthe random variables can be computed with this single metamodel. In order to\nreduce the model complexity, we present a parameter screening technique which\ncan be combined with an interpolation method to solve a reduced stochastic\nmodel. Numerical results of a model problem demonstrate that the RBF metamodel\nis as fast as a low order collocation approach and achieves a good accuracy.\nThe parameter screening is able to reduce the dimension and, thus, to\naccelerate the computation of the stochastic solution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Sep 2013 08:32:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-17"}

When strong Lorentz factor\ngradients are present within the shell it is supposed to spread at sufficiently\nlarge radii. There are two possible mechanisms of spreading: hydrodynamical and\nthermal ones. We consider both mechanisms evaluating the amount of spreading\nthat occurs during expansion up to the moment when the expanding shell becomes\ntransparent for photons. We compute the hydrodynamical spreading of an\nultrarelativistically expanding shell.

Our sample extends the mass range of the\nlensing calibrated M-T relation an order of magnitude lower than any previous\nstudy, resulting in a power-law slope of 1.48$^{+0.13}_{-0.09}$. The slope is\nconsistent with the self-similar model, predictions from simulations, and\nobservations of clusters. However, X-ray observations relying on mass\nmeasurements derived under the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium have\nindicated that masses at group scales are lower than expected. Both simulations\nand observations suggest that hydrostatic mass measurements can be biased low.\nOur external weak lensing masses provides the first observational support for\nhydrostatic mass bias at group level, showing an increasing bias with\ndecreasing temperature and reaching a level of 30-50% at 1 keV.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Sep 2013 10:34:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

The problem becomes particularly crucial when\nconsidering finite precision implementations, where any elementary computation\ncan be affected by a small error.

By combining existing mid-IR\nspectroscopy and new Herschel SPIRE submm photometry from the HerMES program,\nwe derived robust total infrared luminosity (LIR) and dust mass (Md) estimates\nand infered the relative contribution of the AGN to the infrared energy budget\nof the sources. We found that the total infrared emission of galaxies with weak\n6.2um PAH emission (EW<0.2um) is dominated by AGN activity, while for galaxies\nwith EW>0.2um more than 50% of the LIR arises from star formation. We also\nfound that for galaxies detected in the 250-500um Herschel bands an AGN has a\nstatistically insignificant effect on the temperature of the cold dust and the\nfar-IR colours of the host galaxy, which are primarily shaped by star formation\nactivity. For star-forming galaxies we reveal an anti-correlation between the\nLIR-to-rest-frame 8um luminosity ratio, IR8 = LIR\\L8, and the strength of PAH\nfeatures.

In this work, opinion dynamics are examined when agents\nare Bayesian decision makers that perform hypothesis testing or signal\ndetection, and the dynamics are applied to prior probabilities of hypotheses.\nBounded confidence is defined on prior probabilities through Bayes risk error\ndivergence, the appropriate measure between priors in hypothesis testing. This\ndefinition contrasts with the measure used between opinions in standard models:\nabsolute error. It is shown that the rapid convergence of prior probabilities\nto a small number of limiting values is similar to that seen in the standard\nKrause-Hegselmann model.

The number of final values or\nclusters is maximal at intermediate signal-to-noise ratios, suggesting that the\nmost contentious issues lead to the largest number of factions.

We set up a low pressure torsion balance and studied\nphotophoretic forces. We investigated the dependence on plate dimensions and on\nambient pressure and considered the influence of channels through the plates.\nAs samples for full (no channel) plates we used tissue with 2mm thickness and\ncircular shape with diameters of 10mm, 30mm and 50mm. The influence of channels\nwas probed on rectangular-shaped circuit boards of 35mm x 35mm area and 1.5mm\nthickness. The number of channels was 169 and 352. At low pressure, the\nabsolute photophoretic force is proportional to the cross section of the\nplates. At high pressure, gas flow through the channels enhances the\nphotophoretic force. The pressure dependence of the radiative force can\n(formally) be calculated by photophoresis on particles with a characteristic\nlength. We derived two characteristic length scales l depending on the plate\nradius r_1, the channel radius r_2, and the thickness of the plate which equals\nthe length of the channel d as l=r^{0.35} x d^{0.65}. The highest force is\nfound at a pressure p_max = 15 x l^{-1}Pa mm. In total, the photophoretic force\non a plate with channels can be well described by a superposition of the two\ncomponents: photophoresis due to the overall size and cross section of the\nplate and photophoresis due to the channels, both with their characteristic\npressure dependencies. We applied these results to the transport of large\nsolids in protoplanetary disks and found that the influence of porosity on the\nphotophoretic force can reverse the inward drift of large solids, for instance\nmeter-sized bodies, and push them outward within the optically thin parts of\nthe disk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Sep 2013 14:15:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-17"}

In this paper I give a brief overview of the\nnew observational findings related to the Blazhko effect, like extreme\nmodulations, irregular modulation cycles and additional periodicities. I argue\nthat these findings together with dedicated ground-based efforts now provide us\nwith a fairly complete picture and a good starting point to theoretical\ninvestigations. Indeed, new, unpredicted dynamical phenomena have been\ndiscovered in Blazhko RR Lyrae stars, such as period doubling, high-order\nresonances, three-mode pulsation and low-dimensional chaos. These led to the\nproposal of a new explanation to this century-old enigma, namely a high-order\nresonance between radial modes. Along these lines I present the latest efforts\nand advances from the theoretical point of view.

The Kuramoto model constitutes the\nmost studied and paradigmatic framework in which to study synchronization.

The critical properties of the synchronization\ntransition of this model have been widely studied and many variants of its\nformulations have been considered to address different physical realizations.\nHowever, the Kuramoto model has been studied only within the domain of\nclassical dynamics, thus neglecting its applications for the study of quantum\nsynchronization phenomena.

These stationary structures\ncan represent plausible candidates for the modelling of coronal plasmas\nexpected to arise in association with accretion discs. However, accretion disc\ncoronae are formed by a highly diluted environment, and so the fluid\ndescription may be inappropriate. The question is posed of whether similar\noff-equatorial solutions can be determined also in the case of collisionless\nplasmas for which treatment based on kinetic theory, rather than fluid one, is\ndemanded. In this paper the issue is addressed in the framework of the\nVlasov-Maxwell description for non-relativistic multi-species axisymmetric\nplasmas subject to an external dominant spherical gravitational and dipolar\nmagnetic field. Equilibrium configurations are investigated and explicit\nsolutions for the species kinetic distribution function are constructed, which\nare expressed in terms of generalized Maxwellian functions characterized by\nisotropic temperature and non-uniform fluid fields. The conditions for the\nexistence of off-equatorial tori are investigated. It is proved that these\nlevitating systems are admitted under general conditions when both\ngravitational and magnetic fields contribute to shaping the spatial profiles of\nequilibrium plasma fluid fields. Then, specifically-kinetic effects carried by\nthe equilibrium solution are explicitly provided and identified here with\ndiamagnetic, energy-correction and electrostatic contributions.

While the\nmorphology of most galaxies can be associated with a stage on the Hubble\nsequence, morphology of galaxy mergers is far more complex due to the\ncombination of two or more galaxies with different morphologies and the\ninteraction between them. Here we propose a computational method based on\nunsupervised machine learning that can quantitatively analyze morphologies of\ngalaxy mergers and associate galaxies by their morphology. The method works by\nfirst generating multiple synthetic galaxy models for each galaxy merger, and\nthen extracting a large set of numerical image content descriptors for each\ngalaxy model. These numbers are weighted using Fisher discriminant scores, and\nthen the similarities between the galaxy mergers are deduced using a variation\nof Weighted Nearest Neighbor analysis such that the Fisher scores are used as\nweights.
