KOI-94 has a planetary system in which four planetary\ndetections have been reported by {\\it Kepler}, suggesting that this system is\nintriguing to study the dynamical evolutions of planets. However, while two of\nthose detections (KOI-94.01 and 03) have been made robust by previous\nobservations, the others (KOI-94.02 and 04) are marginal detections, for which\nfuture confirmations with various techniques are required. We have conducted\nhigh-contrast direct imaging observations with Subaru/HiCIAO in $H$ band and\ndetected a faint object located at a separation of $\\sim0.6''$ from KOI-94. The\nobject has a contrast of $\\sim 1\\times 10^{-3}$ in $H$ band, and corresponds to\nan M type star on the assumption that the object is at the same distance of\nKOI-94. Based on our analysis, KOI-94.02 is likely to be a real planet because\nof its transit depth, while KOI-94.04 can be a false positive due to the\ncompanion candidate. The success in detecting the companion candidate suggests\nthat high-contrast direct imaging observations are important keys to examine\nfalse positives of KOIs. On the other hand, our transit light curve reanalyses\nlead to a better period estimate of KOI-94.04 than that on the KOI catalogue\nand show that the planetary candidate has the same limb darkening parameter\nvalue as the other planetary candidates in the KOI-94 system, suggesting that\nKOI-94.04 is also a real planet in the system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Sep 2013 16:02:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-11"}

By a systematic study of simulated data, we\nfound that such an implementation of DTF validation is capable of selecting and\nverifying particles from cryo-EM micrographs with a signal-to-noise ratio as\nlow as 0.002. Importantly, we demonstrated that DTF validation can robustly\nevade over-fitting or reference bias from the particle-picking template,\nallowing true signal to emerge from amidst heavy noise in an objective fashion.\nThe DTF approach allows efficient assembly of a large number of single-particle\ncryo-EM images of smaller biomolecules or specimens containing\ncontrast-degrading agents like detergents in a semi-automatic manner.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Sep 2013 19:19:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-16"}

Moreover, biased transmission is less important to culture\nthan the creative processes by which novelty is generated. Fourth, there is no\nobjective basis for determining cultural fitness.

Previous PAH\nsearches based on rotational spectroscopy have only targeted the bowl-shaped\ncorannulene molecule, with the underlying assumption that other polar PAHs are\ntriaxial and have a complex and diluted spectrum unusable for identification\npurposes. In this paper the rotational spectrum of quasi-symmetric PAHs is\ncomputed analytically. It is shown that the asymmetry of planar,\nnitrogen-substituted symmetric PAHs is small enough that their rotational\nspectrum, when observed with a resolution of about a MHz, has the appearance of\na \"comb\" of evenly spaced stacks of lines. The simple pattern of these \"comb\"\nspectra allows for the use of matched-filtering techniques, which can result in\na significantly enhanced signal-to-noise ratio. Detection forecasts are\ndiscussed for regions harbouring \"anomalous microwave emission\", believed to\noriginate from the collective PAH rotational emission. A systematic search for\nPAH lines in various environments is advocated. If detected, PAH \"combs\" would\nallow to the conclusive and unambiguous identification of specific,\nfree-floating interstellar PAHs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Sep 2013 20:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Oct 2013 16:41:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-21"}

The basis vectors of the O(2l+1) supset O(2l-1) x U(1) can easily be\nconstructed from those of U(2l + 1) supset U(2l-1) x U(2) supset O(2l-1) x U(1)\nwith no boson pairs, from which one can construct symmetric irreducible\nrepresentations of O(2l+1) in the O(2l-1) x U(1) basis when all symmetric\nirreducible representations of O(2l-1) are known.

First, we study games G in their own right, and ask how to\nexplain that a position x in G is won, lost, or drawn. The resulting notion of\ngame provenance is closely related to winning strategies, and excludes from\nprovenance all \"bad moves\", i.e., those which unnecessarily allow the opponent\nto improve the outcome of a play. In this way, the value of a position is\ndetermined by its game provenance. We then define provenance games by viewing\nthe evaluation of a first-order query as a game between two players who argue\nwhether a tuple is in the query answer. For RA+ queries, we show that game\nprovenance is equivalent to the most general semiring of provenance polynomials\nN[X]. Variants of our game yield other known semirings. However, unlike\nsemiring provenance, game provenance also provides a \"built-in\" way to handle\nnegation and thus to answer why-not questions: In (provenance) games, the\nreason why x is not won, is the same as why x is lost or drawn (the latter is\npossible for games with draws). Since first-order provenance games are\ndraw-free, they yield a new provenance model that combines how- and why-not\nprovenance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Sep 2013 20:19:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-20"}

In order to reduce\nambiguity in the transmission of information, agreement on a set of conventions\nfor recurring problems is favored. In addition to that, speakers tend to use\nparticular linguistic variants associated with the social groups they identify\nwith. The influence of other groups propagating across the speech community as\nnew variant forms sustains the competition between linguistic variants. With\nthe utterance selection model, an evolutionary description of language change,\nBaxter et al. [Phys. Rev.

Tuning the\ninteraction strength between groups allows us to gain deeper understanding\nabout the way in which linguistic variants propagate and how their distribution\ndepends on the group partitioning. Both for the group size and the number of\ngroups we find scaling behaviors with two asymptotic regimes. If groups are\nstrongly connected, the dynamics is that of the standard utterance selection\nmodel, whereas if their coupling is weak, the magnitude of the latter along\nwith the system size governs the way consensus is reached. Furthermore, we find\nthat a high influence of the interlocutor on a speaker's utterances can act as\na counterweight to group segregation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Sep 2013 21:34:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

It is noted that\nphysical systems being appropriately described by the TB model can exhibit the\nmain strongly correlated electron system (SCES) properties, when they are\nsolved in the HF approximation, by also allowing crystal symmetry breaking\neffects and non-collinear spin orientations of the HF orbitals. It is argued\nhow a simple 2D square lattice system of Coulomb interacting electrons can\nexhibit insulator gaps and pseudogap states, and quantum phase transitions as\nillustrated by the mentioned former works. A discussion is also presented here\nindicating the possibility of attaining room temperature superconductivity, by\nmeans of a surface coating with water molecules of cleaved planes of graphite,\nbeing orthogonal to its c-axis. The possibility that 2D arrays of quantum dots\ncan give rise to the same effect is also proposed to consideration. The\nanalysis also furnishes theoretical insight to solve the Mott-Slater debate, at\nleast for the La2CuO4 and TMO band structures. The idea is to apply a properly\nnon-collinear GW scheme to the electronic structure calculation of these\nmaterials. The fact is that the GW approach can be viewed as a HF procedure in\nwhich the screening polarization is also determined. This directly indicates\nthe possibility of predicting the assumed dielectric constant in the previous\nworks. Thus, the results seem to identify that the main correlation properties\nin these materials are determined by screening.

Its key idea\nis to generate evacuation routes lazily for evacuated areas and to optimize the\nevacuation over these routes in a master problem. Each new path is generated to\nremedy conflicts in the evacuation and adds new columns and a new row in the\nmaster problem. The algorithm is applied to massive flood scenarios in the\nHawkesbury-Nepean river (West Sydney, Australia) which require evacuating in\nthe order of 70,000 persons. The proposed approach reduces the number of\nvariables from 4,500,000 in a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) formulation to\n30,000 in the case study. With this approach, realistic evacuations scenarios\ncan be solved near-optimally in real time, supporting both evacuation planning\nin strategic, tactical, and operational environments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Sep 2013 23:42:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-12"}

In the presence of more severe stiffness, such as ethylene\noxidation (111 species and 1566 irreversible reactions), RKC-GPU performed more\nthan 17 times faster than RKC-CPU on six cores for 32,768 ODEs and larger, and\nat best 4.5 times faster than VODE on six CPU cores for 65,536 ODEs. With a\nlarger time step size, RKC-GPU performed at best 2.5 times slower than six-core\nVODE for 8192 ODEs and larger. Therefore, the need for developing new\nstrategies for integrating stiff chemistry on GPUs was discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Sep 2013 01:29:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Nov 2013 17:40:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-05"}

The intrinsic\nbi-partite correlation functions allow key bit to be generated through high\nlevel communication language i.e. a key bit is directly encoded to shared\ncorrelation functions not to the state and detection of a photon at Bob does\nnot mean key bit. These make the scheme robust against intercept-resend attack\nbecause Alice and Bob can always check the errors in their measurements and\nreveal the presence of Eve in their channel without leaking any key bit\ninformation. The laser source is located in the middle of Alice and Bob,\nconsists of two modes (x,y), relatively random phase-modulated $(\\pm\n\\frac{\\pi}{2})$ weak coherent states combined in a perfect 50/50 beam splitter.\nThe scheme is strictly relied on the perfect beam splitter and mean photon\nnumber less than 1, where more than one photon in a coherent pulse will\nintroduce more errors in Bob even without the presence of Eve. From the\npercentage of errors in Bob, we can estimate the amount of information will be\nleaked to Eve in the photon-number splitting attack.

MIMA-MAC, a classical MIMO\nMAC protocol utilizing concurrent link scheme, is able to provide superior link\nthroughput over conventional single link MAC (under certain isolated link\ntopologies). However, when utilizing rich link adaptation functions in MIMO\nsystems, there exists a non-ignorable probability that MIMA-MAC's throughput\nwill be lower than that of single link scheme (such probability is dominated by\nthe statistics of instantaneous link topology and channel response). Inspired\nby this critical observation, and for adapting to various link topologies, this\npaper will present a novel MAC design that can adaptively switch between single\nor concurrent link scheme. With the aim of absolutely outperforming the single\nlink MAC, here our optimization criterion is to guarantee a throughput result\nthat is either better than or at least equal to single link MAC's counterpart.\nTo highlight the design rationale, we first present an idealized implementation\nhaving network information perfectly known in a non-causal way. Then for\nrealistic applications, we further develop a practical MAC implementation\ndealing with realistic system impairments (distributed handshaking and\nimperfect channel estimation). Simulation results validate that link throughput\nin our MAC is higher than or equal to single link MAC's counterpart with\nminimized outage probabilities. And for ergodic link throughput, our proposed\nMAC can outperform the single link MAC and MIMA-MAC by around 20{%}-30{%}.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Sep 2013 05:47:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-12"}

As in the \"usual\" EdS model, corresponding to\n$\\kappa=1$, self-similarity provides a powerful instrument to delimit the\nphysically relevant clustering resolved by a simulation. Likewise, if stable\nclustering applies, it implies scale-free non-linear clustering. We derive the\ncorresponding exponent $\\gamma_{sc} (n, \\kappa)$ of the two point correlation\nfunction. We then report the results of extensive N-body simulations, of\ncomparable size to those previously reported in the literature for the case\n$\\kappa=1$, and performed with an appropriate modification of the GADGET2 code.\nWe observe in all cases self-similarity in the two point correlations, down to\na lower cut-off which decreases monotonically in time in comoving coordinates.\nThe self-similar part of the non-linear correlation function is fitted well in\nall cases by a single power-law with an exponent in good agreement with\n$\\gamma_{sc} (n, \\kappa)$. Our results thus indicate that stable clustering\nprovides an excellent approximation to the non-linear correlation function over\nthe resolved self-similar scales, at least down to $\\gamma_{sc} (n, \\kappa)\n\\approx 1$, corresponding to the case $n=-2$ for $\\kappa=1$.

This pivotal date is considered crucial to the various\ncalculations of the early chronology of the ancient Near East. According to the\nVenus Tablet (Enuma Anu Enlil 63) which describes the rising and setting of\nVenus during the reign of Ammisaduqa, there are only 4 possibilities implying 4\ndates for the destruction of Ur (1912, 1944, 2004, 2064 BCE) but a tablet of\nastronomical omens (Enuma Anu Enlil 20,21) mentions a lunar eclipse, dated\n14/III/48, at the end of the reign of Shulgi and a lunar eclipse, dated\n14/XII/24, at the end of the reign of Ibbi-Sin. Over the period 2200-1850 BCE\nthere are only 3 pairs of eclipses, spaced by 42 years, matching the\ndescription of astronomical omens but only 1 agreeing with the previous 4\ndates. The second way to check the date for the fall of Babylon is to rebuild\nthe chronology of this period thanks to synchronisms dated by astronomy from\nAssyrian, Babylonian, Egyptian and Israelite chronologies which provide\nsynchronisms that can be dated independently. The Mesopotamian chronology of\nthis period is reconstructed using the number of Assyrian eponyms (1 a year)\nand the length of Babylonian reigns combined with the set of synchronisms among\nAssyrian and Babylonian kings in Annals. During the reign of Assur-dan I\n(1179-1133) eponyms began on 1 Nisan instead of 1 Sippu, but Assyrian lunar\nyears without intercalation remained the norm until Tiglath-pileser I. As the\nBabylonian year began on 1st Nisan (just after the spring equinox), Assyrian\nyears coincided with Babylonian lunar years with intercalation, thus the period\nbetween Assur-dan I and Tiglath-pileser I was therefore transitional. Owing to\nthe Babylonian chronology and synchronisms it is possible to date other\nchronologies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Sep 2013 08:31:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-12"}

The Cotton-York tensor is rarely mentioned in connection\nwith gravitational waves in this approach. This tensor acts as a source for the\nmagnetic part of the Weyl tensor which should not be neglected in studies of\ngravitational waves in the 1+3 formalism. The tensor is only mentioned in\nconnection with studies of 'silent model' but even there the connection with\ngravitational waves is not exhaustively explored. In this study, we demonstrate\nthat the Cotton-York tensor encodes contributions from both electric, magnetic\npart of the Weyl tensor and in directly from the shear tensor. In our opinion,\nthis makes the Cotton-York tensor arguably the natural choice for linear\ngravitational waves in the 1+3 covariant formalism. The tensor is cumbersome to\nwork with but that should negate its usefulness. It is conceivable that the\ntensor would equally be useful in the metric approach, although we have not\ndemonstrated this in the current study. We contend that the use of only one of\nthe Weyl tensor or the shear tensor, although phenomenologically correct, leads\nto loss of information.

The properties of such systems depend both on their\ndimensionality and the interactions between their particles. We introduce a\nmodel for self-propelled rods in two dimensions that interact via a\nseparation-shifted Lennard-Jones potential. Due to the finite potential\nbarrier, the rods are able to cross. This model allows us to efficiently\nsimulate systems of self-propelled rods that effectively move in two dimensions\nbut can occasionally escape to the third dimension in order to pass each other.\nOur quasi-two-dimensional self-propelled particles describe a class of active\nsystems that encompasses microswimmers close to a wall and filaments propelled\non a substrate. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we first determine the\nisotropic-nematic transition for passive rods. Using Brownian dynamics\nsimulations, we characterize cluster formation of self-propelled rods as a\nfunction of propulsion strength, noise, and energy barrier. Contrary to rods\nwith an infinite potential barrier, an increase of the propulsion strength does\nnot only favor alignment but also effectively decreases the potential barrier\nthat prevents crossing of rods. We thus find a clustering window with a maximum\ncluster size at medium propulsion strengths.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Sep 2013 14:02:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Jan 2014 13:30:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-07"}

To simplify the algorithm for SIT retrieval from RA, constant ice\ndensity has been applied until now, which lead to different results for derived\nSIT and SID, in dependence on input information for sea ice density and snow\ndepth. The purpose of this paper is to select algorithm for SID and SIT\nretrieval from RA, using statistical, sensitivity analyses and independent\nobservations of SID from moored ULS, or on Submarine. The impact of ice density\nand snow depth on accuracy of the retrieved SIT has been examined, applying\nsensitivity analyses, and the propagated uncertainties have been summarised.\nAccuracy of algorithms for snow depth retrieval in the Arctic have been\ndiscussed and it is concluded that the assumption of half snow depth over First\nYear Ice (FYI) will lead always to underestimation of SIT and SID derived from\nRA and is not applicable for SIT retrieval from RA, using the equation for\nhydrostatic equilibrium.

We consider stable and metastable states and emphasize the\nimportance of the latter for systems with long-range interactions. For $d\\le\n2$, there is no phase transition. For $d>2$, phase transitions can take place\nbetween a \"gaseous\" phase unaffected by the exclusion constraint and a\n\"condensed\" phase dominated by this constraint. The condensed configurations\nhave a core-halo structure made of a \"rocky core\" surrounded by an\n\"atmosphere\", similar to a giant gaseous planet.

In aposematic systems, prey warning signals\nbenefit both predator and prey. When the signal is highly beneficial, a third\nspecies often evolves to mimic the unpalatable species, exploiting the\nsignaling system for its own protection. We investigated the evolutionary\ndevelopment of predator cue utilization and prey signaling in a digital\npredator-prey system in which mimicking prey could evolve to alter their\nappearance to resemble poison-free or poisonous prey. In predators, we observed\nrapid evolution of cue recognition (i.e. active behavioral responses) when\npresented with sufficiently poisonous prey. In addition, active signaling (i.e.\nmimicry) evolved in prey under all conditions that led to cue utilization. Thus\nwe show that despite imperfect and dishonest signaling, given a high cost of\nconsuming poisonous prey, complex systems of interspecific communication can\nevolve via predator cue recognition and prey signal manipulation. This provides\nevidence supporting hypotheses that cues may serve as stepping-stones in the\nevolution of more advanced communication systems and signals incorporating\ninformation about the environment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Sep 2013 15:11:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-04"}

Our main\nargument is that such a level of detail is very difficult and error-prone to\ncapture as a set of authorisation policies. In this paper, we present ACTORS, a\ngoal-driven approach to manage consent. The main idea behind ACTORS is to\nleverage the goal-driven approach of Teleo-Reactive (TR) programming for\nmanaging consent that takes into account changes regarding the domains and\ncontexts in which the patient is providing her consent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Sep 2013 15:49:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-12"}

In\nthis paper, considering the use of LDGM-based quantizers in a class of\nsymmetric source coding problems, with the alphabet being either binary or\nnon-binary, it is proved rigorously that, as long as the degree distribution\nsatisfies certain conditions that can be evaluated with density evolution (DE),\nthe belief propagation (BP) marginals used in the decimation step have\nvanishing mean-square error compared to the exact marginals when the block\nlength and iteration count goes to infinity, which potentially allows\nnear-ideal distortion performances to be achieved. This provides a sound\ntheoretical basis for the degree distribution optimization methods previously\nproposed in the literature and already found to be effective in practice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Sep 2013 15:51:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-12"}

The main results are: (i) The accretion flow in the Hill sphere is\nintrinsically 3D for hydrodynamic and MHD models. Net inflow toward the planet\nis dominated by high latitude flows. A circumplanetary disk (CPD) forms. Its\nmidplane flows outward in a pattern whose details differ between models. (ii)\nGap opening magnetically couples and ignites the dead zone near the planet,\nleading to stochastic accretion, a quasi-turbulent flow in the Hill sphere and\na CPD whose structure displays high levels of variability. (iii) Advection of\nmagnetized gas onto the rotating CPD generates helical fields that launch\nmagnetocentrifugally driven outflows. During one specific epoch a highly\ncollimated, one-sided jet is observed. (iv) The CPD's surface density\n$\\sim30{\\rm\\,g\\,cm^{-2}}$, small enough for significant ionization and\nturbulence to develop. (v) The accretion rate onto the planet in the MHD\nsimulation reaches a steady value $8 \\times 10^{-3} {\\rm M_\\oplus yr^{-1}}$,\nand is similar in the viscous hydrodynamic runs. Our results suggest that gas\naccretion onto a forming giant planet within a magnetized PPD with dead zone\nallows rapid growth from Saturnian to Jovian masses. As well as being relevant\nfor giant planet formation, these results have important implications for the\nformation of regular satellites around gas giant planets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Sep 2013 15:53:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Oct 2013 19:21:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}
