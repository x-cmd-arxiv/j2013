However,\nfocusing with conventional lenses is restricted to one transport mean free path\nin scattering media, limiting both optical penetration depth and resolution.\nFocusing deeper is possible by using optical phase conjugation or wavefront\nshaping to compensate for the scattering. For practical applications, wavefront\nshaping offers the advantage of a robust optical system that is less sensitive\nto optical misalignment. Here, the phase of the incident light is spatially\ntailored using a phase-shifting array to pre-compensate for scattering. The\nchallenge, then, is to determine the phase pattern which allows light to be\noptimally delivered to the target region. Optimization algorithms are typically\nemployed for this purpose, with visible particles used as targets to generate\nfeedback. However, using these particles is invasive, and light delivery is\nlimited to fixed points. Here, we demonstrate a method for non-invasive and\ndynamic focusing, by using ultrasound encoding as a virtual guide star for\nfeedback to an optimization algorithm. The light intensity at the acoustic\nfocus was increased by an order of magnitude. This technique has broad\nbiomedical applications, such as in optogenetics or photoactivation of drugs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Sep 2013 16:16:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-10"}

These applications are becoming\nincreasingly popular (e.g., Waze reported 30 million users in 2013) since they\naggregate real-time road traffic updates from actual users traveling on the\nroads. However, the providers of these mobile services have access to such\nsensitive information as timestamped locations and movements of its users. In\nthis paper, we describe Haze, a protocol for traffic-update applications that\nsupports the creation of traffic statistics from user reports while protecting\nthe privacy of the users. Haze relies on a small subset of users to jointly\naggregate encrypted speed and alert data and report the result to the service\nprovider. We use jury-voting protocols based on threshold cryptosystem and\ndifferential privacy techniques to hide user data from anyone participating in\nthe protocol while allowing only aggregate information to be extracted and sent\nto the service provider. We show that Haze is effective in practice by\ndeveloping a prototype implementation and performing experiments on a\nreal-world dataset of car trajectories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Sep 2013 17:17:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-16"}

In this case, the desired output emerges rarely and randomly from a\nquantum-state generator. An important example is the heralded production of\nhigh-purity single-photon states, typically based on some nonlinear optical\ninteraction. In contrast, on-demand single-photon sources were also reported,\nexploiting the quantized level structure of matter systems. These sources,\nhowever, lead to highly impure output states, composed mostly of vacuum. While\nsuch impure states may still exhibit certain single-photon-like features such\nas anti-bunching, they are not enough nonclassical for advanced quantum\ninformation processing. On the other hand, the intrinsic randomness of pure,\nheralded states can be circumvented by first storing and then releasing them on\ndemand. Here we propose such a controlled release, and we experimentally\ndemonstrate it for heralded single photons. We employ two optical cavities,\nwhere the photons are both created and stored inside one cavity, and finally\nreleased through a dynamical tuning of the other cavity. We demonstrate storage\ntimes of up to 300 ns, while keeping the single-photon purity around 50% after\nstorage. This is the first demonstration of a negative Wigner function at the\noutput of an on-demand photon source or a quantum memory. In principle, our\nstorage system is compatible with all kinds of nonclassical states, including\nthose known to be essential for many advanced quantum information protocols.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Sep 2013 17:26:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-17"}

The method is capable of\nproducing uniform designs in subregions of computer model input space defined\nby a membership function that consists of a continuous function passing a\nthreshold test, and does so far more efficiently than current methods when\nthese subregions are small. Our application is designing for regions of input\nspace that are not ruled out by history matching, a statistical methodology\napplied in numerous diverse scientific applications whereby model runs are used\nto cut out regions of input space that are incompatible with real world\nobservations. History matching defines a membership function for a region of\ninput space that is not ruled out yet by observations in the form of a distance\nmetric called implausibility. We use this distance metric to drive a new type\nof Evolutionary Monte Carlo algorithm with a uniform distribution on the not\nruled out yet region as its target distribution. The algorithm can locate and\ngenerate uniform points within extremely small subspaces of the computer model\ninput space with complex and even disconnected topologies. We illustrate the\nperformance of the technique in comparison to current methods with a number of\nidealised examples.

Within the framework of self-organised\ncriticality a separation of timescales is thought to be crucial for the\nobservation of power-law dynamics and computational models are often\nconstructed with this property. However, this is not necessarily a\ncharacteristic of physiological neural networks - external input does not only\noccur when the network is at rest/a steady state. In this paper we study a\nsimple neuronal network model driven by a continuous external input (i.e.\\ the\nmodel does not have a separation of timescales) and analytically tuned to\noperate in the region of a critical state (it reaches the critical regime\nexactly in the absence of input - the case studied in the companion paper to\nthis article). The system displays avalanche dynamics in the form of cascades\nof neuronal firing separated by periods of silence. We observe partial\nscale-free behaviour in the distribution of avalanche size for low levels of\nexternal input. We analytically derive the distributions of waiting times and\ninvestigate their temporal behaviour in relation to different levels of\nexternal input, showing that the system's dynamics can exhibit partial\nlong-range temporal correlations. We further show that as the system approaches\nthe critical state by two alternative `routes', different markers of\ncriticality (partial scale-free behaviour and long-range temporal correlations)\nare displayed. This suggests that signatures of criticality exhibited by a\nparticular system in close proximity to a critical state are dependent on the\nregion in parameter space at which the system (currently) resides.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Sep 2013 18:33:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-22"}

This\noverproduction factor may, however, vary by orders of magnitude due to\nuncertainties in the 33S(p,\\gamma)34Cl reaction rate at nova peak temperatures.\nDepending on this rate, 33S could potentially be used as a diagnostic tool for\nclassifying certain types of presolar grains.

Additionally, the total S elemental abundance\nwhich is affected by this reaction has been proposed as a thermometer to study\nthe peak temperatures of novae. Previously, the 33S(p,\\gamma)34Cl reaction rate\nhad only been studied directly down to resonance energies of 432 keV. However,\nfor nova peak temperatures of 0.2-0.4 GK there are 7 known states in 34Cl both\nbelow the 432 keV resonance and within the Gamow window that could play a\ndominant role. Direct measurements of the resonance strengths of these states\nwere performed using the DRAGON recoil separator at TRIUMF. Additionally two\nnew states within this energy region are reported. Several hydrodynamic\nsimulations have been performed, using all available experimental information\nfor the 33S(p,\\gamma)34Cl rate, to explore the impact of the remaining\nuncertainty in this rate on nucleosynthesis in nova explosions.

The infinite\ntime MSD, $<r^2>$, appears as a parameter in the model and is determined by\nfits of the model to the finite time $I_{inc}(Q,t)$.

We confirm earlier results that in the kinematic stage of the\nlarge-scale instability the horizontal wavelength of structures is about 10\ntimes the density scale height. At later times, even larger structures are\nbeing produced in a fashion similar to inverse spectral transfer in helically\ndriven turbulence. Using turbulence simulations, we find that magnetic flux\nconcentrations occur for different values of the Mach number between 0.1 and\n0.7.

In this paper, we further examine how current LHC results\nconstrain naturalness in three classes of models that may relax LHC bounds on\nsparticles: split families, baryonic RPV, and Dirac gauginos. In models of\nsplit families and bRPV, the bounds on the gluino are only slightly reduced,\nresulting in a few percent tuning. In particular, having a natural spectrum in\nbRPV models typically implies that tops, Ws, and Zs are easily produced in the\ncascade decays of squarks and gluinos.

Darth Fader employs wavelet\nfiltering to both estimate the continuum & to extract prominent line features\nin each galaxy spectrum. A simple selection criterion based on the number of\nfeatures present in the spectrum is then used to clean the catalogue: galaxies\nwith fewer than six total features are removed as we are unlikely to obtain a\nreliable redshift estimate. Applying our wavelet-based cleaning algorithm to a\nsimulated testing set, we successfully build a clean catalogue including\nextremely low signal-to-noise data (SNR=2.0), for which we are able to obtain a\n5.1% catastrophic failure rate in the redshift estimates (compared with 34.5%\nprior to cleaning).

Here, we\nanalyse two types of system-environment interaction, phase and amplitude\ndamping, which allows us to conclude that, in general, a finite-time quantum\nmeasurement performed during a certain period is more efficient than an\ninstantaneous measurement performed at the end of it, because the rate of\nchange of the populations is attenuated by the system-measurement apparatus\ninteraction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Sep 2013 03:29:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Jul 2014 16:39:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-29"}

There is no need of maintaining an overlaid mesh\nand running multicast routing protocol to maintain a multicast tree in this\nmesh.

For instance, the normal\ninterface strength for GBs containing D structural unit (SU) or stacking faults\nin the GB structural description ({\\Sigma}13 (510) {\\theta}=22.6{\\deg} and\n{\\Sigma}97 (940) {\\theta}=47.9{\\deg}) shows a noticeable decrease in interface\nstrength, as compared to other evaluated <100> GBs that contained favored SUs.\nIn the case of <110> interfaces, the presence of the E SU in the GB structure\nlowers the maximum normal interface strength by 35%. Further investigation of\nthe deformation at the crack tip in GBs containing the E structure revealed\nthat the E SU underwent atomic shuffling to accommodate intrinsic stacking\nfaults (ISFs) along the interface, which in turn acts as a site for partial\ndislocation nucleation. Interestingly, regardless of GB misorientation, GB\ninterfaces examined here containing the E structure in their structural period\nexhibited relatively small variation in maximum normal strength of interface.\nThe GB volume ahead of the crack tip underwent structural rearrangement which,\nin turn, influenced the crack propagation mechanism. In most GBs, the crack\npropagation was due to alternating mechanisms of dislocation emission, followed\nby propagation of dislocation (blunting) and cleavage/crack advance. Moreover,\nthe crack growth rates along the GB interface were strongly influenced by the\ninitial free volume at the interface, i.e., faster crack growth was observed\nalong interfaces with higher initial free volume.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Sep 2013 08:03:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

A detailed description and quantification of contacts in\nhospitals provides key information for HAIs epidemiology and for the design and\nvalidation of control measures. We used wearable sensors to detect close-range\ninteractions (\"contacts\") between individuals in the geriatric unit of a\nuniversity hospital. Contact events were measured with a spatial resolution of\nabout 1.5 meters and a temporal resolution of 20 seconds. The study included 46\nHCWs and 29 patients and lasted for 4 days and 4 nights. 14037 contacts were\nrecorded. The number and duration of contacts varied between mornings,\nafternoons and nights, and contact matrices describing the mixing patterns\nbetween HCW and patients were built for each time period. Contact patterns were\nqualitatively similar from one day to the next. 38% of the contacts occurred\nbetween pairs of HCWs and 6 HCWs accounted for 42% of all the contacts\nincluding at least one patient, suggesting a population of individuals who\ncould potentially act as super-spreaders. Wearable sensors represent a novel\ntool for the measurement of contact patterns in hospitals.

In case the Markov process is actually an\ni.i.d.\\ process, the rate function turns out to be the relative entropy (or\nKullback-Leibler divergence) between the true and the estimated probability\nvectors.

Our second main result is the rigorous homogenization of\nthese linearized equations and the proof that the effective tensor satisfies\nOnsager properties, namely is symmetric positive definite. We eventually make\nnumerical comparisons with the ideal case. Our numerical results show that the\nMSA model confirms qualitatively the conclusions obtained using the ideal model\nbut there are quantitative differences arising that can be important at high\ncharge or high concentrations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Sep 2013 15:28:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 Jun 2014 10:12:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-14"}

Many of these simulations use the same\ninitial condition: a rotating torus of fluid in hydrostatic equilibrium. A\npersistent concern is that simulation results sometimes depend on arbitrary\nfeatures of the initial torus. For example, the Bernoulli parameter (which is\nrelated to outflows), appears to be controlled by the Bernoulli parameter of\nthe initial torus. In this paper, we give a new equilibrium torus solution and\ndescribe two applications for the future. First, it can be used as a more\nphysical initial condition for GRMHD simulations than earlier torus solutions.\nSecond, it can be used in conjunction with earlier torus solutions to isolate\nthe simulation results that depend on initial conditions. We assume\naxisymmetry, an ideal gas equation of state, constant entropy, and ignore\nself-gravity. We fix an angular momentum distribution and solve the\nrelativistic Euler equations in the Kerr metric. The Bernoulli parameter,\nrotation rate, and geometrical thickness of the torus can be adjusted\nindependently. Our torus tends to be more bound and have a larger radial extent\nthan earlier torus solutions. While this paper was in preparation, several\nGRMHD simulations appeared based on our equilibrium torus. We believe it will\ncontinue to provide a more realistic starting point for future simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Sep 2013 15:29:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

The method starts\nwith a single cluster containing all pixels, and, at each step, (i) selects a\ncluster in such a way that the error at the next step is minimized, and (ii)\nsplits the selected cluster into two disjoint clusters using rank-two NMF in\nsuch a way that the clusters are well balanced and stable.
