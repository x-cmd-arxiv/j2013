It was\nsuggested that the distortion of the Fe K_alpha emission results from Doppler\nand relativistic effects affecting the radiative transfer close to the strong\ngravitational well of the central compact object: a stellar mass black hole\n(BH) or neutron star (NS) in the case of XRBs, or a super massive black hole\n(SMBH) in the case of AGN. However, alternative approaches based on\nreprocessing and transmission of radiation through surrounding media also\nattempt to explain the line broadening. So far, spectroscopic and timing\nanalyzes have not yet convinced the whole community to discriminate between the\ntwo scenarios. Here we study to which extent X-ray polarimetric measurements of\nblack hole X-ray binaries (BHXRBs) and type-1 AGN could help to identify the\npossible origin of the line distortion. To do so, we report on recent\nsimulations obtained for the two BH flavors and show that the proposed\nscenarios are found to behave differently in polarization degree and\npolarization angle. A relativistic origin for the distortion is found to be\nmore probable in the context of BHXRBs, supporting the idea that the same\nmechanism should lead the way also for AGN. We show that the discriminating\npolarization signal could have been detectable by several X-ray polarimetry\nmissions proposed in the past.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Sep 2013 16:01:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-09"}

One\nof the key challenges to achieve those contrasts is to remove low-order\naberrations, using a Low-Order WaveFront Sensor (LOWFS). An experiment\nsimulating the starlight suppression system is currently developed at NASA Ames\nResearch Center, and includes a LOWFS controlling tip/tilt modes in real time\nat 500 Hz. The LOWFS allowed us to reduce the tip/tilt disturbances to 1e-3\nlambda/D rms, enhancing the previous contrast by a decade, to 8e-7 between 1.2\nand 2 lambda/D. A Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) controller is currently\nimplemented to improve even more that result by reducing residual vibrations.\nThis testbed shows that a good knowledge of the low-order disturbances is a key\nasset for high contrast imaging, whether for real-time control or for post\nprocessing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Sep 2013 17:40:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

The solution of the full, nonlinear EOM for\nthe RNO is plagued by instabilities, and resorting to linear response is not an\noption for the ultimate goal to study nonperturbative dynamics in intense laser\nfields.

In the insulating\nregion of x < 0.67, the temperature dependence of electrical resistivity for\nthe x = 0.5 and 0.33 films can be scaled with the variable range hopping model.\nThe possible mechanisms behind the observed MIT were discussed, including the\neffects of electron correlation, lattice distortion and Anderson localization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Sep 2013 19:22:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

More generally, one may use the modal value of the m nearest\nsamples, where m is a fixed positive integer (although m=1 is known to be\nadmissible in the sense that no larger value is asymptotically superior in\nterms of prediction error). The nearest neighbor rule is nonparametric and\nextremely general, requiring in principle only that the domain be a metric\nspace. The classic paper on the technique, proving convergence under\nindependent, identically-distributed (iid) sampling, is due to Cover and Hart\n(1967). Because taking samples is costly, there has been much research in\nrecent years on selective sampling, in which each sample is selected from a\npool of candidates ranked by a heuristic; the heuristic tries to guess which\ncandidate would be the most \"informative\" sample. Lindenbaum et al.

When the normal subgroup N is abelian, this\nstrategy is well-known. Our first contribution is to extend this strategy to\nhandle the case when N is not necessarily abelian. This allows us to provide a\nunified explanation of all recent polynomial-time algorithms for special group\nclasses.\n  Guided by this strategy, to make further progress on GpI, we consider\ncentral-radical groups, proposed in Babai et al. (SODA 2011): the class of\ngroups such that G mod its center has no abelian normal subgroups. This class\nis a natural extension of the group class considered by Babai et al. (ICALP\n2012), namely those groups with no abelian normal subgroups. Following the\nabove strategy, we solve GpI in $n^{O(\\log \\log n)}$ time for central-radical\ngroups, and in polynomial time for several prominent subclasses of\ncentral-radical groups. We also solve GpI in $n^{O(\\log\\log n)}$ time for\ngroups whose solvable normal subgroups are elementary abelian but not\nnecessarily central.

Here we study small\nTuring machines (TMs) with two symbols, and two and three states. For any\nparticular such machine $\\tau$ and any particular input $x$ we consider what we\ncall the 'space-time' diagram which is the collection of consecutive tape\nconfigurations of the computation $\\tau(x)$. In our setting, we define fractal\ndimension of a Turing machine as the limiting fractal dimension of the\ncorresponding space-time diagram. It turns out that there is a very strong\nrelation between the fractal dimension of a Turing machine of the\nabove-specified type and its runtime complexity. In particular, a TM with three\nstates and two colors runs in at most linear time iff its dimension is 2, and\nits dimension is 1 iff it runs in super-polynomial time and it uses polynomial\nspace. If a TM runs in time $O(x^n)$ we have empirically verified that the\ncorresponding dimension is $(n+1)/n$, a result that we can only partially\nprove.

Since such a potential is classically chaotic\nand unstable to changes in initial conditions, it was conjectured that the\norigin of the observed stability is purely quantum mechanical, with no\nclassical analog. In this paper, we show that the observed stability is a\nresult of the physics of the QPC and the nature of the experiment.

However, sharing information is often\ncostly for the agents while resulting in no direct immediate benefit for them.\nHence, lacking incentives to collaborate, strategic agents who aim to maximize\ntheir own individual utilities will withhold rather than share information,\nleading to inefficient operation or even collapse of networks. In this paper,\nwe develop a systematic framework for designing distributed rating protocols\naimed at incentivizing the strategic agents to collaborate with each other by\nsharing information. The proposed incentive protocols exploit the ongoing\nnature of the agents' interactions to assign ratings and through them,\ndetermine future rewards and punishments: agents that have behaved as directed\nenjoy high ratings -- and hence greater future access to the information of\nothers; agents that have not behaved as directed enjoy low ratings -- and hence\nless future access to the information of others. Unlike existing rating\nprotocols, the proposed protocol operates in a distributed manner, online, and\ntakes into consideration the underlying interconnectivity of agents as well as\ntheir heterogeneity. We prove that in many deployment scenarios the price of\nanarchy (PoA) obtained by adopting the proposed rating protocols is one. In\nsettings in which the PoA is larger than one, we show that the proposed rating\nprotocol still significantly outperforms existing incentive mechanisms such as\nTit-for-Tat. Importantly, the proposed rating protocols can also operate\nefficiently in deployment scenarios where the strategic agents interact over\ntime-varying network topologies where new agents join the network over time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Sep 2013 03:57:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 Sep 2013 16:53:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

The current radio data show a steepening of the\nspectrum at higher frequencies, which has implications for models of the radio\nhalo origin. There is an on-going debate on the possibility that the observed\nsteepening is not intrinsic to the emitted radiation, but is instead caused by\nthe SZ effect. Recently, the Planck satellite measured the SZ signal and its\nspatial distribution in the Coma cluster allowing to test this hypothesis.\nUsing the Planck results, we calculated the modification of the radio halo\nspectrum by the SZ effect in three different ways. With the first two methods\nwe measured the SZ-decrement within the aperture radii used for flux\nmeasurements of the halo at the different frequencies. First we adopted the\nglobal compilation of data from Thierbach et al. and a reference aperture\nradius consistent with those used by the various authors. Second we used the\navailable brightness profiles of the halo at different frequencies to derive\nthe spectrum within two fixed apertures, and derived the SZ-decrement using\nthese apertures. As a third method we used the quasi-linear correlation between\nthe y and the radio-halo brightness at 330 MHz discovered by Planck to derive\nthe modification of the radio spectrum by the SZ-decrement in a way that is\nalmost independent of the adopted aperture radius. We found that the spectral\nmodification induced by the SZ-decrement is 4-5 times smaller than that\nnecessary to explain the observed steepening. Consequently a break or cut-off\nin the spectrum of the emitting electrons is necessary to explain current data.\nWe also show that, if a steepening is absent from the emitted spectrum, future\ndeep observations at 5 GHz with single dishes are expected to measure a halo\nflux in a 40 arcmin radius that would be 7-8 times higher than currently seen.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Sep 2013 05:07:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

In this paper, the concept of stable $k$-error\nlinear complexity is proposed to study sequences with stable and large\n$k$-error linear complexity. In order to study k-error linear complexity of\nbinary sequences with period $2^n$, a new tool called cube theory is developed.\nBy using the cube theory, one can easily construct sequences with the maximum\nstable $k$-error linear complexity. For such purpose, we first prove that a\nbinary sequence with period $2^n$ can be decomposed into some disjoint cubes\nand further give a general decomposition approach. Second, it is proved that\nthe maximum $k$-error linear complexity is $2^n-(2^l-1)$ over all\n$2^n$-periodic binary sequences, where $2^{l-1}\\le k<2^{l}$. Thirdly, a\ncharacterization is presented about the $t$th ($t>1$) decrease in the $k$-error\nlinear complexity for a $2^n$-periodic binary sequence $s$ and this is a\ncontinuation of Kurosawa et al. recent work for the first decrease of k-error\nlinear complexity. Finally, A counting formula for $m$-cubes with the same\nlinear complexity is derived, which is equivalent to the counting formula for\n$k$-error vectors. The counting formula of $2^n$-periodic binary sequences\nwhich can be decomposed into more than one cube is also investigated, which\nextends an important result by Etzion et al..\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Sep 2013 07:14:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-10"}

The results\nshow that on increasing the Al content in Fe-Al alloys, the mean positron\nlifetime of the alloys increase, while the mean electron density of the alloys\ndecrease. The increase of Al content in binary Fe-Al alloys will decrease the\namount of unpaired 3d electrons; as a consequence the probability of positron\nannihilation with 3d electrons and the hyperfine field decrease rapidly.\nMossbauer spectra of binary Fe-Al alloys with Al content less than 25at% show\ndiscrete sextets, these alloys give ferromagnetic contribution at room\ntemperature. The M\\\"ossbauer spectrum of Fe70Al30 shows a broad singlet. As Al\ncontent higher than 40 at%, the M\\\"ossbauer spectra of these alloys are\nsinglet, that is, the alloys are paramagnetic.

Many of these platforms apply graph\nstructures and analysis techniques to enable users to ingest, update, query and\ncompute on the topological structure of these relationships represented as\nset(s) of edges between set(s) of vertices. To store and process Facebook-scale\ndatasets, they must be able to support data sources with billions of edges,\nupdate rates of millions of updates per second, and complex analysis kernels.\nThese platforms must provide intuitive interfaces that enable graph experts and\nnovice programmers to write implementations of common graph algorithms.
