One of\nthe most important is the first-order necessary optimality condition that\ngeneralizes the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker condition. This condition ensures the\nexistence of an arbitrary neighborhood that contains an local optimal solution.\nThe present work we introduce an alternative concept to identify the local\noptimal solution neighborhood in vector optimization problems. The main aspect\nof this contribution is the development of necessary and sufficient Pareto\noptimality conditions for the solutions of a particular vector optimization\nproblem, where each objective function consists of a ratio quadratic functions\nand the feasible set is defined by linear inequalities. We show how to\ncalculate the largest radius of the spherical region centered on a local Pareto\nsolution in which this solution is optimal. In this process we may conclude\nthat the solution is also globally optimal. These conditions might be useful to\ndetermine termination criteria in the development of algorithms, including more\ngeneral problems in which quadratic approximations are used locally.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Sep 2013 18:49:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 Nov 2017 18:22:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-09"}

An important weak consistency\nproperty is k-atomicity, which bounds the staleness of values returned by read\noperations. The k-atomicity-verification problem (or k-AV for short) is the\nproblem of deciding whether a given history of operations is k-atomic. The 1-AV\nproblem is equivalent to verifying atomicity/linearizability, a well-known and\nsolved problem. However, for k > 2, no polynomial-time k-AV algorithm is known.\n  This paper makes the following contributions towards solving the k-AV\nproblem. First, we present a simple 2- AV algorithm called LBT, which is likely\nto be efficient (quasilinear) for histories that arise in practice, although it\nis less efficient (quadratic) in the worst case. Second, we present a more\ninvolved 2-AV algorithm called FZF, which runs efficiently (quasilinear) even\nin the worst case. To our knowledge, these are the first algorithms that solve\nthe 2-AV problem fully. Third, we show that the weighted k-AV problem, a\nnatural extension of the k-AV problem, is NP-complete.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Sep 2013 19:32:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-24"}

A cosmic\nstring segment is expected to cause weak lensing as well as an integrated\nSachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect, the so-called Gott-Kaiser-Stebbins (GKS) effect, to\nthe CMB temperature fluctuation, which are thus naturally cross-correlated. We\npoint out that, in the presence of such a correlation, yet another kind of the\npost-recombination CMB temperature bispectra, the ISW-lensing bispectra, will\narise in the form of products of the auto- and cross-power spectra. We first\npresent an analytic method to calculate the autocorrelation of the temperature\nfluctuations induced by the strings, and the cross-correlation between the\ntemperature fluctuation and the lensing potential both due to the string\nnetwork. In our formulation, the evolution of the string network is assumed to\nbe characterized by the simple analytic model, the velocity-dependent one scale\nmodel, and the intercommutation probability is properly incorporated in orderto\ncharacterize the possible superstringy nature. Furthermore, the obtained power\nspectra are dominated by the Poisson-distributed string segments, whose\ncorrelations are assumed to satisfy the simple relations. We then estimate the\nsignal-to-noise ratios of the string-induced ISW-lensing bispectra and discuss\nthe detectability of such CMB signals from the cosmic string network.

Therefore, in order to\nachieve the potential gain, it is imperative to cancel these echoes. As these\nhigh power echoes can saturate low noise amplifier (LNA) and also digital\ndomain echo cancellation requires unrealistically high resolution\nanalog-to-digital converter (ADC), the echoes should be cancelled or suppressed\nsufficiently before LNA. In this paper we present a closed-loop echo\ncancellation technique which can be implemented purely in analogue domain. The\nadvantages of our method are multiple-fold: it is robust to phase noise, does\nnot require additional set of antennas, can be applied to wideband signals and\nthe performance is irrelevant to radio frequency (RF) impairments in transmit\nchain.

Studying this representation\nwe discovered an exact mapping between the Kondo lattice Hamiltonian and a\nHamiltonian describing three spinless fermions interacting on a lattice. We\ninvestigate the effectiveness of this three fermion representation by\nperforming a zero temperature mean-field study of the phase diagram at\ndifferent couplings and fillings for the one-dimensional case, focusing on the\nappearance of ferromagnetism. The solutions agree in many respects with the\nknown numerical and analytical results. In particular, in the ferromagnetic\nregion connected to the solution at zero electron density, we have a\nquantitative agreement on the value of the commensurability parameter\ndiscovered in recent DMRG (in one dimension) and DMFT (in infinite dimensions)\nsimulations; furthermore we provide a theoretical justification for it,\nidentifying a symmetry of the Hamiltonian. This ferromagnetic phase is\nstabilized by the emergence of a spin-selective Kondo insulator that is\ndescribed quite conveniently by the three spinless fermions. We discovered also\na different ferromagnetic phase at high filling and low couplings. This phase\nresembles the RKKY ferromagnetic phase existing at vanishing filling, but it\nincorporates much more of the Kondo effect, making it energetically more\nfavorable than the typical spiral (spin ordered) mean field ground states. We\nbelieve that this second phase represents a prototype for the strange\nferromagnetic tongue identified by numerical simulations inside the\nparamagnetic dome. At the end of the work we also provide a discussion of\npossible orders different from the ferromagnetic one.

In particular, we\nstudy the influence of the fractional portion of the dark matter, by computing\nin each case the percentage of chaotic orbits, as well as the percentages of\norbits of the main regular resonant families. In an attempt to distinguish\nbetween regular and chaotic motion, we use the Fast Lyapunov Indicator (FLI)\nmethod to extensive samples of orbits obtained by integrating numerically the\nequations of motion as well as the variational equations. Furthermore, a\ntechnique which is based mainly on the field of spectral dynamics that utilizes\nthe Fourier transform of the time series of each coordinate is used for\nidentifying the various families of regular orbits and also to recognize the\nsecondary resonances that bifurcate from them. Two cases are studied in our\nwork: (i) the case where we have a disk galaxy model (ii) the case where our\nmodel represents an elliptical galaxy. Comparison with early related work is\nalso made.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Sep 2013 15:28:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-28"}
