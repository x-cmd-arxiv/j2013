It is argued that the trajectories obeying them also satisfy the\nAbraham-Lorentz-Dirac (ALD) equations for general 3D motions in the\nnon-relativistic and relativistic limits. The case of forces only depending of\nthe proper time is here considered. For these properties to hold, it is\nsufficient that the external force to be infinitely smooth and that a series\nformed with its time derivatives converges. This series define in a special\nlocal way the effective forces entering the Newton equations. When the external\nforce vanishes in an open vicinity of a given time, the effective one also\nbecomes null. Thus, the proper solutions of the effective equations can not\nshow runaway or pre-acceleration effects.

However, MSMs approximate the\ntrue dynamics by assuming a Markov chain on a clusters discretization of the\nstate space. This approximation is difficult to make for high-dimensional\nbiomolecular systems, and the quality and reproducibility of MSMs has therefore\nbeen limited. Here, we discard the assumption that dynamics are Markovian on\nthe discrete clusters. Instead, we only assume that the full phase- space\nmolecular dynamics is Markovian, and a projection of this full dynamics is\nobserved on the discrete states, leading to the concept of Projected Markov\nModels (PMMs). Robust estimation methods for PMMs are not yet available, but we\nderive a practically feasible approximation via Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). It\nis shown how various molecular observables of interest that are often computed\nfrom MSMs can be computed from HMMs / PMMs. The new framework is applicable to\nboth, simulation and single-molecule experimental data.

We analyze each wavelet power spectra\nfor transient coherency, and global periodicities resulting from the\nsuperposition of repeating coherent structures. From the significant wavelet\npower spectra, we find evidence for a general upper-limit on individual\ntransient coherency of $\\sim$10 days. We find evidence for a set of global\nperiodicities between 4-5 hours and 35-45 days. We find evidence for the\ndistribution of individual transient coherency scales consisting of two\ndistinct populations. Below the $\\sim$2 day time scale the distribution is\nreasonably approximated by an inverse power law, whereas for scales $\\gtrsim$2\ndays, the distribution levels off showing discrete peaks at common coherency\nscales. In addition, by organizing the transient coherency scale distributions\nby wind type, we find these larger, common coherency scales are more prevalent\nand well-defined in coronal hole wind. Finally, we discuss the implications of\nour results for current theories of solar wind generation and describe future\nwork for determining the relationship between the coherent structures in our\nionic composition data and the structure of the coronal magnetic field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Sep 2013 17:18:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-07"}

The SNR of a single short exposure of\na dim NEA is insufficient to detect it in one frame, but by computationally\nsearching for an appropriate velocity vector, shifting successive frames\nrelative to each other and then co-adding the shifted frames in\npost-processing, we synthetically create a long-exposure image as if the\ntelescope were tracking the object.

Here we establish a\ndirect connection between planar scattering amplitudes of ABJM theory, and\nsingularities there of, to the stratification of the positive orthogonal\ngrassmannian. In particular, scattering processes are constructed through\non-shell diagrams, which are simply iterative gluing of the fundamental\nfour-point amplitude. Each diagram is then equivalent to the merging of\nfundamental OG_2 orthogonal grassmannian to form a larger OG_k, where 2k is the\nnumber of external particles. The invariant information that is encoded in each\ndiagram is precisely this stratification. This information can be easily read\noff via permutation paths of the on-shell diagram, which also can be used to\nderive a canonical representation of OG_k that manifests the vanishing of\nconsecutive minors as the singularity of all on-shell diagrams. Quite\nremarkably, for the BCFW recursion representation of the tree-level amplitudes,\nthe on-shell diagram manifests the presence of all physical factorization\npoles, as well as the cancellation of the spurious poles. After analytically\ncontinuing the orthogonal grassmannian to split signature, we reveal that each\non-shell diagram in fact resides in the positive cell of the orthogonal\ngrassmannian, where all minors are positive.

In addition,\nfor publicly available summary statistics from large meta-analyses of 4 lipid\ntraits, we publicly release imputed summary statistics at 1000G SNPs, which\ncould not have been obtained using previously published methods, and\ndemonstrate their accuracy by masking subsets of the data. We show that 1000G\nimputation using our approach increases the magnitude and statistical evidence\nof enrichment at genic vs. non-genic loci for these traits, as compared to an\nanalysis without 1000G imputation. Thus, imputation of summary statistics will\nbe a valuable tool in future functional enrichment analyses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Sep 2013 19:44:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-03"}

This allows each node to conserve energy and\ncontribute to increasing the lifetime of the network. In this paper, in\ncontrast to most previous work, we consider (i) both the energy costs of\ncommunication as well as the amount of available energy at each node, (ii) the\nrealistic situation of varying rates of energy consumption at different nodes,\nand (iii) the fact that co-operation between nodes, where some nodes make a\nsacrifice by increasing energy consumption to help other nodes reduce their\nconsumption, can be used to extend network lifetime. This paper introduces a\nnew distributed topology control algorithm, called the Cooperative Topology\nControl with Adaptation (CTCA), based on a game-theoretic approach that maps\nthe problem of maximizing the network's lifetime into an ordinal potential\ngame. We prove the existence of a Nash equilibrium for the game. Our simulation\nresults indicate that the CTCA algorithm extends the life of a network by more\nthan 50% compared to the best previously-known algorithm.

In this\npaper we consider diffusive processes in the bulk of Weyl semimetals, which are\nexotic quantum materials, recently of considerable interest. In order to do\nthis, we first explicitly implement the analytical scheme by which disorder\nwith anisotropic scattering amplitude is incorporated into the diagrammatic\nresponse-function formalism for calculating the `diffuson'. The result thus\nobtained is consistent with transport coefficients evaluated from the Boltzmann\ntransport equation or the renormalized uniform current vertex calculation, as\nit should be. We thus demonstrate that the computation of the diffusion\ncoefficient should involve the transport lifetime, and not the quasiparticle\nlifetime. Using this method, we then calculate the density response function in\nWeyl semimetals and discover an unconventional diffusion process that is\nsignificantly slower than conventional diffusion. This gives rise to relaxation\nprocesses that exhibit stretched exponential decay, instead of the usual\nexponential diffusive relaxation. This result is then explained using a model\nof thermally excited quasiparticles diffusing with diffusion coefficients which\nare strongly dependent on their energies. We elucidate the roles of the various\nenergy and time scales involved in this novel process and propose an experiment\nby which this process may be observed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Sep 2013 20:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-05"}

Gravitational perturbations from the companion are expected\nto excite high planetesimal eccentricities resulting in destruction, rather\nthan growth, of objects with sizes of up to several hundred km in collisions of\nsimilar-size bodies. It was recently suggested that gravity of a massive\naxisymmetric gaseous disk in which planetesimals are embedded drives rapid\nprecession of their orbits, suppressing eccentricity excitation. However, disks\nin binaries are themselves expected to be eccentric, leading to additional\nplanetesimal excitation. Here we develop secular theory of eccentricity\nevolution for planetesimals perturbed by the gravity of an elliptical\nprotoplanetary disk (neglecting gas drag) and the companion. For the first time\nwe derive an expression for the disturbing function due to an eccentric disk,\nwhich can be used for a variety of other astrophysical problems. We obtain\nexplicit analytical solutions for planetesimal eccentricity evolution and\ndelineate four different regimes of dynamical excitation. We show that in\nsystems with massive (>10^{-2}M_Sun) disks, planetesimal eccentricity is\nusually determined by the gravity of the eccentric disk alone, and is\ncomparable to the disk eccentricity. As a result, the latter imposes a lower\nlimit on collisional velocities of solids, making their growth problematic.\nThis fragmentation barrier can be removed if the gaseous disk rapidly precesses\nor if its own self-gravity is efficient at lowering disk eccentricity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Sep 2013 20:14:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 29 Oct 2014 17:48:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-31"}

Within this model, the local polarization shows a direct relation to\ninternal strain and can be expressed in terms of internal strain parameters.\nThe predictions of the present theory show excellent agreement with a formal\nBerry phase calculation for random distortions of a test-case CuPt-like InGaN\nalloy and InGaN supercells with randomly placed cations.

Today, the\ncorresponding optimization tradeoffs are fairly well-understood, at least in\nthe static case and from a worst-case perspective.\n  This paper revisits the peer-to-peer topology design problem from a\nself-organization perspective. We initiate the study of topologies which are\noptimized to serve the communication demand, or even self-adjusting as demand\nchanges. The appeal of this new paradigm lies in the opportunity to be able to\ngo beyond the lower bounds and limitations imposed by a static,\ncommunication-oblivious, topology. For example, the goal of having short\nrouting paths (in terms of hop count) does no longer conflict with the\nrequirement of having low peer degrees.\n  We propose a simple overlay topology Obst(k) which is composed of k (rooted\nand directed) Binary Search Trees (BSTs), where k is a parameter. We first\nprove some fundamental bounds on what can and cannot be achieved optimizing a\ntopology towards a static communication pattern (a static Obst(k)). In\nparticular, we show that the number of BSTs that constitute the overlay can\nhave a large impact on the routing costs, and that a single additional BST may\nreduce the amortized communication costs from Omega(log(n)) to O(1), where n is\nthe number of peers. Subsequently, we discuss a natural self-adjusting\nextension of Obst(k), in which frequently communicating partners are \"splayed\ntogether\".\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Sep 2013 22:09:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-16"}

In the particular case of unfriendly\napertures (mainly large central obscuration) when very high contrast is needed\n(e.g. direct imaging of older exoplanets with extremely large telescopes or\nspace- based coronagraphs), a simple VC, as most coronagraphs, can not deliver\nits nominal performance because of the contamination due to the diffraction\nfrom the obscured part of the pupil.

The\nprobabilities of each of these events provide the most important parameters of\nthe model. Fully differentiated cells do not divide, but a proportion undergoes\nprogrammed death in each generation. Our previous models showed that failure of\nprogrammed death - for example, in tumorigenesis - could lead either to\nexponential growth in cell numbers or to growth to some plateau.

To be more precise, the coefficients appearing\nin the Lovelock expansion are fixed by requiring the theory to have a unique\nAdS vacuum with a fixed value of the cosmological constant. This yields to\nk=1,2,...,[(D-1)/2] inequivalent possible gravity theories; here the case k=1\ncorresponds to the standard Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian. For each par (D,k), we\nderive two classes of AdS black hole solutions with planar event horizon\ntopology for particular values of the nonminimal coupling parameter. The first\nfamily of solutions depends on a unique constant and is valid only for k>1. In\nfact, its GR counterpart k=1 reduces to the pure AdS metric with a vanishing\nscalar field. The second family of solutions involves two independent constants\nand corresponds to a stealth black hole configuration; that is a nontrivial\nscalar field together with a black hole metric such that both side of the\nEinstein equations (gravity and matter parts) vanishes identically. In this\ncase, the standard GR case k=1 reduces to the Schwarzschild-AdS-Tangherlini\nblack hole metric with a trivial scalar field. In both cases, the existence of\nthese solutions is strongly inherent of the presence of the higher order\ncurvature terms k>1 of the Lovelock gravity.

The recent development of high-pressure synthesis of the Ba\nsubstituted Sr1-yBayRuO3 makes it possible to study ferromagnetism over a\nbroader phase diagram, which includes new orthorhombic Imma and the cubic\nphases. However, the chemical substitutions introduce the A-site disorder\neffect on Tc, which complicates determination of the relationship between\nferromagnetism and the structural distortion. By clarifying the site disorder\neffect on Tc in several new series of ruthenates in which the average bond\nlength <A-O> keeps the same, but the bond-length variance varies, we are able\nto demonstrate a parabolic curve of Tc versus mean bond length <A-O>.

We applied the tool of\nthe LF statistics to three GRB classes predicted by the Fireshell model. One of\nthe main differences between the Fireshell and Fireball models is the\nexplanation of the GRB prompt emission, where the first claims that it is\ndivided in two physical processes: 1) transparency of a optically thick\nFreshell producing the P-GRB emission and 2) interaction of a relativistic\nshell (composed by baryons electron-positron-photon) against the CBM\n(circumburst medium), producing the emission so-called extended afterglow peak\n(EAP). However, the Fireball model, the most quoted one, claims that the prompt\nemission is caused by interactions among several relativistic shells (composed\nby electron-positron-photon) with different Lorentz factors, a process called\ninternal shocks. The transparency produces a strong short emission in the\nbeginning, called P-GRB. Thus, to the Fireshell model, the prompt emission is\nP-GRB plus EAP. We produced, by LF statistics, predicted distributions of: peak\nflux, redshift and peak luminosity for the three GRB classes predicted by\nFireshell model, we also used three GRB rates.

To\nillustrate such possibilities we consider first a well-studied chain with\ndegenerate double-well potential of the interparticle interaction. Contrary to\nprevious studies, we consider varying length of the chain with fixed number of\nparticles. Number of possible energetically degenerate ground states strongly\ndepends on the overall length of the chain, or, in other terms, on average\nlength of the link between neighboring particles. These degenerate states\ncorrespond to mechanical equilibrium, therefore one can say that the transition\nbetween them mimics to some extent a process of plastic deformation. We\ndemonstrate that such modification of the chain length can lead to quite\nprofound (almost five-fold) reduction of the heat conduction coefficient. Even\nmore profound effect is revealed for a model with single-well non-convex\npotential. It is demonstrated that in certain range of constant external\nforcing this model becomes \"effectively\"\\ double-well, and has a multitude of\npossible states of equilibrium for the same value of the external load. Thus,\nthe heat conduction coefficient can be reduced by two orders of magnitude.

In this work, we present\nthe first spectrum of the companion, \"kappa And B,\" using the Project 1640\nhigh-contrast imaging platform. Comparison of our low-resolution YJH-band\nspectra to empirical brown dwarf spectra suggests an early-L spectral type.\nFitting synthetic spectra from PHOENIX model atmospheres to our observed\nspectrum allows us to constrain the effective temperature to ~2000K, as well as\nplace constraints on the companion surface gravity. Further, we use previously\nreported log(g) and effective temperature measurements of the host star to\nargue that the kappa And system has an isochronal age of 220 +/- 100 Myr, older\nthan the 30 Myr age reported previously. This interpretation of an older age is\ncorroborated by the photometric properties of kappa And B, which appear to be\nmarginally inconsistent with other 10-100 Myr low-gravity L-dwarfs for the\nspectral type range we derive. In addition, we use Keck aperture masking\ninterferometry combined with published radial velocity measurements to rule out\nthe existence of any tight stellar companions to kappa And A that might be\nresponsible for the system's overluminosity. Further, we show that luminosity\nenhancements due to a nearly \"pole-on\" viewing angle coupled with extremely\nrapid rotation is unlikely. Kappa And A is thus consistent with its slightly\nevolved luminosity class (IV) and we propose here that kappa And, with a\nrevised age of 220 +/- 100 Myr, is an interloper to the 30 Myr Columba\nassociation with which it was previously associated. The photometric and\nspectroscopic evidence for kappa And B combined with our re-assesment of the\nsystem age implies a substellar companion mass of 50^{+16}_{-13} Jupiter\nMasses, consistent with a brown dwarf rather than a planetary mass companion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Sep 2013 05:46:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

The assumption is that where we know the mechanisms\nunderlying within-subject effects, these effects can be used to measure\nindividual differences in those same mechanisms. However, between-subject\nvariability can arise from an entirely different source from that driving\nwithin-subject effects, and here we report a clear-cut demonstration of this.\nWe examined the debated relationship between the visibility of a masked-prime\nstimulus and the direction of priming it causes (positive or reversed). Such\nreversal of priming has been hypothesized to reflect an automatic inhibitory\nmechanism that controls partially activated responses and allows behavioural\nflexibility. Within subjects, we found an unambiguous systematic transition\nfrom reversed priming to positive priming as prime visibility increased,\nreplicated seven times, and using different stimulus manipulations. However,\nacross individuals there was never a relationship between prime discrimination\nability and priming. Specifically, these data resolve the controversial debate\non visibility and reversed priming, indicating that they arise from independent\nprocesses relying on partially shared stimulus signals. More generally, they\nstand as an exemplar case in which variance between individuals arises from a\ndifferent source from that produced by stimulus manipulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Sep 2013 08:42:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-16"}

This\nstochastic process is indexed by a scaling parameter $K$ that goes to infinity,\nfollowing a large population assumption. When the birth and natural death\nparameters are of order $K$, the sequence of stochastic processes indexed by\n$K$ converges toward a slow-fast dynamics.

In this class\nof models the apparent power loss at large scales is caused by the background\ndynamics which involves a sharp transition from a fast-roll power law phase to\na period of Starobinsky-like slow-roll inflation. An interesting feature of\nthis class of string inflationary models is that the number of e-foldings of\ninflation is inversely proportional to the string coupling to a positive power.\nTherefore once the string coupling is tuned to small values in order to trust\nstring perturbation theory, enough e-foldings of inflation are automatically\nobtained without the need of extra tuning.

While accurate, the use of binary variables can cause problems when\nstudying large networks with many intersections. Instead, the signal control\ncan be approximated through a continuum approach where the on-and-off control\nvariable is replaced by a priority parameter. Advantages of such approximation\ninclude elimination of the need for binary variables, lower time resolution\nrequirements, and more flexibility and robustness in a decision environment. It\nalso resolves the issue of discontinuous travel time functions arising from the\ncontext of dynamic traffic assignment. Despite these advantages in application,\nit is not clear from a theoretical point of view how accurate is such continuum\napproach; i.e., to what extent is this a valid approximation for the on-and-off\ncase. The goal of this paper is to answer these basic research questions and\nprovide further guidance for the application of such continuum signal model. In\nparticular, by employing the Lighthill-Whitham-Richards model (Lighthill and\nWhitham, 1955; Richards, 1956) on a traffic network, we investigate the\nconvergence of the on-and-off signal model to the continuum model in regimes of\ndiminishing signal cycles. We also provide numerical analyses on the continuum\napproximation error when the signal cycles are not infinitesimal. As we\nexplain, such convergence results and error estimates depend on the type of\nfundamental diagram assumed and whether or not vehicle spillback occurs in a\nnetwork. Finally, a traffic signal optimization problem is presented and solved\nwhich illustrates the unique advantages of applying the continuum signal model\ninstead of the on-and-off one.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Sep 2013 14:16:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 Mar 2016 22:42:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-25"}

It is known that network coding maps used at the relay node\nwhich ensure unique decodability at the end nodes form a Latin Square. Also, it\nis known that minimum distance of the effective constellation at the relay node\nbecomes zero, when the ratio of the fade coefficients from the end node to the\nrelay node, belongs to a finite set of complex numbers determined by the signal\nset used, called the singular fade states. Furthermore, it has been shown\nrecently that the problem of obtaining network coding maps which remove the\nharmful effects of singular fade states, reduces to the one of obtaining Latin\nSquares, which satisfy certain constraints called \\textit{singularity removal\nconstraints}.

The model is formulated\nin terms of effective propagators and vertices for the exchange objects: the\npomeron, the odderon, and the reggeons. The vertices are required to respect\nstandard rules of QFT. The propagators are constructed taking into account the\ncrossing properties of amplitudes in QFT and the power-law ansaetze from the\nRegge model. We propose to describe the pomeron as an effective spin 2\nexchange. This tensor pomeron gives, at high energies, the same results for the\np-p and p-pbar elastic amplitudes as the standard Donnachie-Landshoff pomeron.\nBut with our tensor pomeron it is much more natural to write down effective\nvertices of all kinds which respect the rules of QFT. This is particularly\nclear for the coupling of the pomeron to particles carrying spin, for instance\nvector mesons. We describe the odderon as an effective vector exchange. We\nemphasise that with a tensor pomeron and a vector odderon the corresponding\ncharge-conjugation relations are automatically fulfilled.

For standing kink\nmodes, the flow significantly reduces $P_1/nP_n$ in general, the effect being\nparticularly strong for larger $n$ and when the density contrast\n$\\rho_0/\\rho_e$ between loops and their surroundings is weak. That said, even\nwhen $\\rho_0/\\rho_e$ approaches infinity, this effect is still substantial,\nreducing the minimal $P_1/nP_n$ by up to 13.7% (24.5%) for $n=2$ ($n=4$)\nrelative to the static case, when the Alfv\\'en Mach number $M_A$ reaches 0.8\nwhere $M_A$ measures the loop flow speed in units of the internal Alfv\\'en\nspeed.

Vortices\nproduced by the instability look like columns of vorticity in the whole disk\nthickness; the small vertical motions are related to a weak inclination of the\nvortex axis appearing during the development of the RWI. Vortices with aspect\nratios larger than 6 are unaffected by the elliptical instability. They relax\nto a quasi-steady columnar structure which survives hundred of rotations while\nslowly migrating inward toward the star at a rate that reduces with the vortex\naspect ratio. Vortices with a smaller aspect ratio are by contrast affected by\nthe elliptic instability. Short aspect ratio vortices are completely destroyed\nin a few orbital periods. Vortices with an intermediate aspect ratio are\npartially destroyed by the elliptical instability in a region away from the\nmid-plane where the disk stratification is sufficiently large. Elongated Rossby\nvortices can survive a large number of orbital periods in protoplanetary disks\nin the form of vorticity columns. They could play a significant role in the\nevolution of the gas and the gathering of the solid particles to form\nplanetesimals or planetary cores, a possibility that receives a renewed\ninterest with the recent discovery of a particle trap in the disk of Oph IRS48.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Sep 2013 15:35:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 Sep 2013 09:36:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

Inspired by the experimental work of\nIchiki \\emph{et al.} [Phys. Plasmas 8, 4275 (2001)], three types of\nelectronegative plasmas are investigated. The effects of various parameters on\nthe propagation of IAWs are discussed in detail numerically. We find that the\nplasma supports both bright and dark solutions.

The region in the parameter space where the\nMI exists depends sensitively on the positive to negative ion mass ratio (M)\nand negative to positive ion density ratio ($\\nu$). An extensive range of the\nnonextensive $q$-parameters {$(-1<q<3)$} is considered and in each case the MI\nsets in under different conditions.
