This results in straightforward measures to quantify\ncanalization in an automaton (micro-level), which is in turn integrated into a\nhighly scalable framework to characterize the collective dynamics of\nlarge-scale automata networks (macro-level). This way, our approach provides a\nmethod to link micro- to macro-level dynamics -- a crux of complexity. Several\nnew results ensue from this methodology: uncovering of dynamical modularity\n(modules in the dynamics rather than in the structure of networks),\nidentification of minimal conditions and critical nodes to control the\nconvergence to attractors, simulation of dynamical behaviour from incomplete\ninformation about initial conditions, and measures of macro-level canalization\nand robustness to perturbations.

The method has been used to\nexperimentally determine the force-displacement curve for an optical trap over\nits entire range.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Jan 2013 17:00:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-25"}

When focusing on the\nlocations of superstructures identified in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS),\nGranett et al.

We\nrevisit the analysis using our own robust protocol, and extend the study to the\ntwo most recent and largest catalogues of voids publicly available. We quantify\nand subtract the level of foreground contamination in the stacked images and\ndetermine the contribution on the largest angular scales from the first\nmultipoles of the CMB. We obtain the radial temperature and photometry profiles\nfrom the stacked images. Using a Monte Carlo approach, we computed the\nstatistical significance of the profiles for each catalogue and identified the\nangular scale at which the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) is maximum. We\nessentially confirm the signal detection reported by Gr08, but for the other\ntwo catalogues, a rescaling of the voids to the same size on the stacked image\nis needed to find any significant signal (with a maximum at ~2.4 sigmas). This\nprocedure reveals that the photometry peaks at unexpectedly large angles in the\ncase of the Gr08 voids, in contrast to voids from other catalogues. Conversely,\nthe photometry profiles derived from the stacked voids of these other\ncatalogues contain small central hot spots of uncertain origin. We also stress\nthe importance of a posteriori selection effects that might arise when\nintending to increase the S/N, and we discuss the possible impact of void\noverlap and alignment effects.

In this work samples of rays detected in white light images\nor in ultraviolet spectra have been analyzed.

The aim of this study is to provide observational constraints\non theoretical prediction that the winds of M-type AGB objects can be driven by\nphoton scattering on iron-free silicate grains located in the close environment\n(about 2 to 3 stellar radii) of the star. We interpreted\nspectro-interferometric data, first using wavelength-dependent geometric\nmodels. We then used a self-consistent dynamic model atmosphere containing a\ntime-dependent description of grain growth for pure forsterite dust particles\nto reproduce the photometric, spectrometric, and interferometric measurements\nof RT Vir. Since the hydrodynamic computation needs stellar parameters as\ninput, a considerable effort was first made to determine these parameters.

Results from the geometrical modeling give us clues to the presence\nof aluminum and silicate dust in the close circumstellar environment (< ~5\nstellar radii). Comparison between spectro-interferometric data and a\nself-consistent dust-driven wind model reveals that silicate dust has to be\npresent in the region between 2 to 3 stellar radii to reproduce the 59 and 63 m\nbaseline visibility measurements around 9.8 micron. This gives additional\nobservational evidence in favor of winds driven by photon scattering on\niron-free silicate grains located in the close vicinity of an M-type star.\nHowever, other sources of opacity are clearly missing to reproduce the 10-13\nmicron visibility measurements for all baselines. This study is a first attempt\nto understand the wind mechanism of M-type AGB stars by comparing photometric,\nspectrometric, and interferometric measurements with state-of-the-art,\nself-consistent dust-driven wind models. The agreement of the dynamic model\natmosphere with interferometric measurements in the 8-10 micron spectral region\ngives additional observational evidence that the winds of M-type stars can be\ndriven by photon scattering on iron-free silicate grains.

Deep observations with Keck, Gemini,\nVLT, HST, and Spitzer successfully detect the host galaxies and establish\nspectroscopic or photometric redshifts for all 23 events, enabling us to\nprovide measurements of the intrinsic host star-formation rates, stellar\nmasses, and mean extinctions. Compared to the hosts of unobscured GRBs at\nsimilar redshifts, we find that the hosts of dust-obscured GRBs are (on\naverage) more massive by about an order of magnitude and also more rapidly\nstar-forming and dust-obscured. While this demonstrates that GRBs populate all\ntypes of star-forming galaxies including the most massive, luminous systems at\nz~2, at redshifts below 1.5 the overall GRB population continues to show a\nhighly significant aversion away from massive galaxies and a preference for\nlow-mass systems relative to what would be expected given a purely SFR-selected\ngalaxy sample. This supports the notion that the GRB rate is strongly dependent\non metallicity, and may suggest that the most massive galaxies in the Universe\nunderwent a transition in their chemical properties ~9 Gyr ago. We also\nconclude that, based on the absence of unobscured GRBs in massive galaxies and\nthe absence of obscured GRBs in low-mass galaxies, the dust distributions of\nthe lowest-mass and the highest-mass galaxies are relatively homogeneous, while\nintermediate-mass galaxies (~10^9 M_sun) have diverse internal properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Jan 2013 21:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 Aug 2013 08:35:42 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 30 Oct 2013 06:19:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

The SBS algorithm\nis a fusion of the well-tested cluster red-sequence method of Gladders & Yee\n(2000) with the MIR 3.6um - 4.5um cluster detection method developed by\nPapovich (2008). As with the cluster red-sequence method, the SBS identifies\ncandidate overdensities within 3.6um - 4.5um color slices, which are the\nequivalent of a rest-frame 1.6um stellar bump \"red-sequence\". In addition to\nemploying the MIR colors of galaxies, the SBS algorithm incorporates an\noptical/MIR (z' - 3.6um) color cut. This cut effectively eliminates foreground\n0.2 < z < 0.4 galaxies which have 3.6um - 4.5um colors that are similarly red\nas z > 1.0 galaxies and add noise when searching for high-redshift galaxy\noverdensities. We demonstrate using the z ~ 1 GCLASS cluster sample that\nsimilar to the red sequence, the stellar bump sequence appears to be a\nubiquitous feature of high-redshift clusters, and that within that sample the\ncolor of the stellar bump sequence increases monotonically with redshift and\nprovides photometric redshifts accurate to dz = 0.05.

The relative abundance of the main alpha-elements\nwith respect to iron is several times the solar value, and nearly constant as\nwell, implying a uniform enrichment by type II supernovae out to the largest\nscales. Taken as a whole, the observational evidence is not compatible with a\nsuperwind originated by a recent, nuclear starburst, but rather hints at\nwidespread, enhanced star formation proceeding at steady rate over the entire\ndynamical timescale (~200 Myr). The preferred scenario is that of a\nstarburst-processed gas component gently expanding into, and mixing with, a\npre-existing halo medium of lower metallicity (Z ~ 0.1 solar) and temperature\n(kT ~ 0.25 keV). This picture cannot be probed more extensively with the\npresent data, and the ultimate fate of the diffuse, hot gas remains uncertain.\nUnder some favorable conditions, at least a fraction of it might be retained\nafter the merger completion, and evolve into the hot halo of a young elliptical\ngalaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Jan 2013 21:00:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

Only 10 components - five continuum and five\nemission line - are required to produce accurate reconstructions of essentially\nall narrow emission-line galaxies; the median absolute deviations of the\nreconstructed emission-line fluxes, given the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of\nthe observed spectra, are 1.2-1.8 sigma for the strong lines.

As has been shown before, the\ntime-invariant structural properties of the Internet include some most basic\nones, such as the degree distribution or clustering. Here we add to this\ntime-invariant list a non-trivial property - k-dense decomposition. This\nproperty is derived from a recursive form of edge multiplicity, defined as the\nnumber of triangles that share a given edge. We show that after proper\nnormalization, the k- dense decomposition of the Internet has remained stable\nover the last decade, even though the Internet size has approximately doubled,\nand so has the k-density of its k-densest core. This core consists mostly of\ncontent providers peering at Internet eXchange Points, and it only loosely\noverlaps with the high-degree or high-rank AS core, consisting mostly of tier-1\ntransit providers. We thus show that high degrees and high k-densities reflect\ntwo different Internet-specific properties of ASes (transit versus content\nproviders). As a consequence, even though degrees and k-densities of nodes are\ncorrelated, the relative fluctuations are strong, and related to that, random\ngraphs with the same degree distribution or even degree correlations as in the\nInternet, do not reproduce its k-dense decomposition. Therefore an interesting\nopen question is what Internet topology models or generators can fully explain\nor at least reproduce the k-dense properties of the Internet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Jan 2013 01:10:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 1 Feb 2013 01:16:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 7 Aug 2013 20:09:29 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 28 Oct 2013 16:48:47 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 13 Aug 2015 18:42:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-14"}

The\ngiant virus replication factories can in turn be infected by so called\nvirophages, which are smaller viruses that negatively impact giant virus\nreplication. An example are Mimiviruses that infect the protist Acanthamoeba\nand that are themselves infected by the virophage Sputnik. This paper examines\nthe evolutionary dynamics of this system, using mathematical models. While the\nmodels suggest that the virophage population will evolve to increasing degrees\nof giant virus inhibition, it further suggests that this renders the virophage\npopulation prone to extinction due to dynamic instabilities over wide parameter\nranges. Implications and conditions required to avoid extinction are discussed.\nAnother interesting result is that virophage presence can fundamentally alter\nthe evolutionary course of the giant virus. While the giant virus is predicted\nto evolve towards increasing its basic reproductive ratio in the absence of the\nvirophage, the opposite is true its presence. Therefore, virophages can not\nonly benefit the host population directly by inhibiting the giant viruses, but\nalso indirectly by causing giant viruses to evolve towards weaker phenotypes.\nExperimental tests for this model are suggested.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Jan 2013 02:02:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-28"}

We jointly optimize the transmission policies, including power\nallocation, transmission mode selection, and subcarrier assignment for\nmaximizing the weighted sum rates of the two users with diverse\nquality-of-service (QoS) guarantees.

However, recent observations of several peculiar type Ia supernovae\nargue for its progenitor mass to be significantly super-Chandrasekhar. We show\nthat strongly magnetized white dwarfs not only can violate the Chandrasekhar\nmass limit significantly, but exhibit a different mass limit. We establish from\nfoundational level that the generic mass limit of white dwarfs is 2.58 solar\nmass. This explains the origin of over-luminous peculiar type Ia supernovae.\nOur finding further argues for a possible second standard candle, which has\nmany far reaching implications, including a possible reconsideration of the\nexpansion history of the universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Jan 2013 05:02:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-19"}

The standard approach to indirect\nreciprocity are reputation models. These are games in which players base their\ndecisions on their opponent's reputation gained in past interactions with other\nplayers (moral assessment). The combination of actions and moral assessment\nleads to a large diversity of strategies, thus determining the stability of any\nof them against invasions by all the others is a difficult task. We use a\nvariant of a previously introduced reputation-based model that let us\nsystematically analyze all these invasions and determine which ones are\nsuccessful. Accordingly we are able to identify the third-order strategies\n(those which, apart from the action, judge considering both the reputation of\nthe donor and that of the recipient) that are evolutionarily stable. Our\nresults reveal that if a strategy resists the invasion of any other one sharing\nits same moral assessment, it can resist the invasion of any other strategy.\nHowever, if actions are not always witnessed, cheaters (i.e., individuals with\na probability of defecting regardless of the opponent's reputation) have a\nchance to defeat the stable strategies for some choices of the probabilities of\ncheating and of being witnessed. Remarkably, by analyzing this issue with\nadaptive dynamics we find that whether a honest population resists the invasion\nof cheaters is determined by a Hamilton-like rule---with the probability that\nthe cheat is discovered playing the role of the relatedness parameter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Jan 2013 09:09:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Feb 2013 13:54:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 4 May 2013 17:11:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-29"}

The first emission (Ep. 1) goes from 40s\nbefore the 1{\\deg} trigger up to 60s after it. The second (Ep. 2) goes from 35s\nbefore the 2{\\deg} trigger to 100s after it.[...] Within the Induced\nGravitational Collapse (IGC) model, we assume the progenitor to be a close\nbinary system composed of a core of an evolved star and a Neutron Star (NS).\nThe evolved star explodes as a Supernova (SN) and ejects material that is\npartially accreted by the NS. We identify this process with Ep. 1. The\naccretion process brings the NS over its critical mass, thus gravitationally\ncollapsing to a BH. This process leads to the GRB emission, Ep. 2.[...] Aims:\nWe analyze the spectra and time variability of Ep. 1 and 2 and compute the\nrelevant parameters of the binary progenitor[...] in the IGC paradigm. Methods:\nWe perform a time-resolved spectral analysis of Ep. 1 with a blackbody (BB)\nplus a power-law (PL) spectral model. We analyze Ep. 2 within the Fireshell\nmodel, identifying the Proper-GRB (P-GRB) and simulating the light curve and\nspectrum. We establish the redshift to be z=0.75 [...]. Results: We find for\nEp. 1 a BB temperature following a broken PL with time, with the PL slopes at\nearly and late times \\alpha=0 and \\beta=-4+/-2, respectively, and a break at\nt=41.21s. The total energy of Ep. 1 and 2 are E_{iso}^1=1.42x10^{53}erg and\nE_{iso}^2=2.43x10^{52}erg, respectively. We find at transparency a Lorentz\nfactor \\Gamma~173, laboratory radius of 6.04x10^{13}cm, P-GRB observed\ntemperature kT_{P-GRB}=12.36keV, baryon load B=0.0057 and P-GRB energy\nE_{P-GRB}=3.44x10^{50}erg.

Its phase diagram exhibits a quantum phase transition from a superfluid\nto a Mott insulator phase. The dynamics of electronic excitations governed by\nelectrostatic dipole-dipole interactions in the ordered regime can be well\ndescribed by wave-like collective excitations called excitons. Here we present\nan extensive study of such excitons for a wide range of geometries and\ndimensionality. Their lifetimes can vary over many orders of magnitude from\nmetastable propagation to superradiant decay. Particularly strong effects occur\nin one dimensional atomic chains coupled to tapered optical fibers. For an\noptical lattice within a cavity the excitons are coupled to cavity photons and\nthe resulting collective cavity QED model can be efficiently formulated in\nterms of polaritons. Their properties are explicitly calculated for different\nlattices and they constitute a non-destructive monitoring tool for important\nsystem properties. Even the formation of molecules in optical lattices\nmanifests itself in modified polariton properties as e.g. an anisotropic\noptical spectrum. Partial dissipation of the exciton energy in the lattice\nleads to heating, which can be microscopically understood through a mechanism\ntransferring atoms into higher Bloch bands via a resonant excitation transfer\namong neighboring lattice sites. The presence of lattice defects like vacancies\nin the Mott insulator induces a characteristic scattering of polaritons, which\ncan be optically observed to monitor the lattice integrity. Our models can be\napplied to simulate and understand corresponding collective phenomena in solid\ncrystals, where many effects are often masked by noise and disorder.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Jan 2013 12:35:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-31"}

The apsidal motion of a binary system with an eccentric\norbit provides information regarding the interior structure constants of the\nindividual stars. These constants are related to the normalized stellar\ninterior density distribution and can be extracted from the predictions of\nstellar evolution models. We demonstrate that low-mass, pre-main sequence stars\nundergoing radiative core contraction display rapidly changing interior\nstructure constants (greater than 5% per 10 Myr) that, when combined with\nobservational determinations of the interior structure constants (with 5 -- 10%\nprecision), allow for a robust age estimate. This age estimate, unlike those\nbased on surface quantities, is largely insensitive to the surface layer where\neffects of magnetic activity are likely to be most pronounced. On the main\nsequence, where age sensitivity is minimal, the interior structure constants\nprovide a valuable test of the physics used in stellar structure models of\nlow-mass stars.

The novelty of the mathematical model consists in a\nphysically required extension of the deautoconvolution problem beyond the\nclassical case usually discussed in literature: (i) For measurements of\nultrashort laser pulses with the self-diffraction SPIDER method, a stable\napproximate solution of an autocovolution equation with a complex-valued kernel\nfunction is needed. (ii) The considered scenario requires complex functions\nboth, in the solution and the rhs of the integral equation. Since, however,\nnoisy data are available not only for amplitude and phase functions of the rhs,\nbut also for the amplitude of the solution, the stable approximate\nreconstruction of the associated smooth phase function represents the main goal\nof the paper. An iterative regularization approach is described that is\nspecifically adapted to the physical situation in pulse characterization, using\na non-standard stopping rule for the iteration process of computing regularized\nsolutions. Our approach is illustrated by several case studies for synthetic\nnoisy data and physically realistic complex-valued kernel functions. Based on\nan example with focus on amplitude perturbations, we show that the\nautoconvolution equation is locally ill-posed everywhere. To date, the\nanalytical treatment of the impact of noisy data on phase perturbations remains\nan open question. However, we show its influence with the help of numerical\nexperiments. Moreover, we formulate assertions on the non-uniqueness of the\ncomplex-valued autoconvolution problem, at least for the simplified case of a\nconstant kernel. The presented results and figures associated with case studies\nillustrate the ill-posedness phenomena also for the case of non-trivial complex\nkernel functions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Jan 2013 15:14:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-28"}

The common feature of these very\ndifferent material classes lies in the fact that the competition between\nlow-energy scales can be tuned by a nonthermal parameter, such as pressure,\nmagnetic or electric field, and chemical composition for the condensed-matter\nsystems. In heavy-fermion materials, the strong exchange J between f-electrons\nand conduction electrons can lead to quenching of the f-electron-derived\n(nearly) localized magnetic moments via the Kondo effect or, if J becomes\nweaker, to long-range magnetic order via the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida\ninteraction mediated by the conduction electrons. In addition it has been\nsuggested that magnetic order can be suppressed by quantum fluctuations which\nmay be enhanced by geometric frustration. Here we report on the observation of\na quantum phase transition in a partially frustrated antiferromagnetic metallic\nsystem. In antiferromagnetic CePdAl the magnetic Ce ions form a network of\nequilateral triangles in the (001) plane, similar to the kagom\\'e lattice, with\none third of the Ce moments not participating in long-range order. The N\\'eel\ntemperature T_N = 2.7 K can be driven to zero upon replacing 14.4% of Pd by Ni.\nHere the specific heat C exhibits a C/T ~ - log T dependence. Within the\nHertz-Millis-Moriya model of quantum criticality, this behavior can be\nattributed to two-dimensional critical antiferromagnetic fluctuations arising\nfrom the decoupling of three-dimensional magnetic order by frustration. The\nintermediate planes of frustrated moments are a possible candidate for a\ntwo-dimensional spin-liquid. The simultaneous presence of magnetic order,\ngeometric frustration, and Kondo effect in this system might thus entail a new\nroute to quantum criticality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Jan 2013 15:20:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 4 Aug 2013 01:10:34 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 20 Sep 2013 07:32:12 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 18 Feb 2014 15:44:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-19"}

Both the\nentanglement indicator and the phase correction are calculated by the quantum\nsystem itself acting as a neural network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Jan 2013 18:20:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-07"}

The results show that as the refractive index and thickness of the\ndefect layer increase the frequency of the defect mode decreases. In addition,\nit is shown that the frequency of the defect mode is sensitive to the incidence\nangle, polarization and physical properties of the defect layer but it is\ninsensitive to the small lattice loss factor. The height of the defect mode is\nvery sensitive to the loss factor, incidence angle, polarization, refractive\nindex and thickness of the defect layer. It was also shown that the height and\nthe width of the defect mode are affected by the number of the lattice period\nand the loss factor. The results can lead to designing new types of narrow\nfilter structures and other optical devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Jan 2013 17:06:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-12"}

We construct our fullerene design by capping of\npentagons and hexagons of B60 cage in such a way that the total number of atoms\nis preserved. In doing so, a new hole density definition is proposed such that\neach member of a fullerene group has a different hole density which depends on\nthe capping process. Our analysis reveal that each boron fullerene set has its\nlowest-energy configuration around the same normalized hole density and the\nmost stable cages are found in the fullerene groups which have relatively large\ndifference between the maximum and the minimum hole densities. The result is a\nnew stability measure relating the cage geometry characterized by the hole\ndensity to the relative energy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Jan 2013 20:47:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Apr 2013 14:51:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 29 Jan 2015 00:14:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-13"}
