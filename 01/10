Current BNS searches target field\nbinaries whose orbits will have circularized by radiation reaction before their\ngravitational waves enter the Advanced LIGO sensitive band at 15 Hz. It has\nbeen suggested that a population of BNSs may form by n-body interactions near\nsupermassive black holes or in globular clusters and that these systems may\nhave non-negligible eccentricity in the Advanced LIGO band. We show that for\nBNS systems with total mass of 2.4 (6.0) solar masses, the effect of\neccentricity e < 0.02 (0.05) is negligible and a circular search is effectual\nfor these binaries. For eccentricities up to e = 0.4, we investigate the\nselection bias caused by neglecting eccentricity in BNS searches. If such high\neccentricity systems exist, searches that specifically target eccentric\nbinaries will be needed in Advanced LIGO and Virgo.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Jan 2013 17:39:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 7 Jun 2013 21:33:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-11"}

In a nonlinear medium the energy of\nthe wave-packet is stored both in the kinetic and potential parts, and details\nof its propagation are to a large extent determined by the transfer from one\nform of energy to the other.

Using\nvariance as a measure of risk, we introduce two new algorithms, investigate\ntheir theoretical guarantees, and report preliminary empirical results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Jan 2013 18:02:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-10"}

The system is modeled as a flexible hard-sphere chain that\ntranslocates through a cylindrical hole in a hard flat wall. In some\ncalculations, the nanopore is connected at one end to a spherical cavity.\nTranslocation times are measured directly using MC dynamics simulations. For\nsufficiently narrow pores, translocation is sufficiently slow that the mean\ntranslocation time scales with polymer length N according to <\\tau> \\propto\n(N-N_p)^2, where N_p is the average number of monomers in the nanopore; this\nscaling is an indication of a quasi-static regime in which polymer-nanopore\nfriction dominates.

Sequencing technologies\nprovide an overview of an aggregate of numerous cells, rather than\nsubclonal-specific quantification of aberrations such as single nucleotide\nvariants (SNVs). Computational approaches to de-mix a single collective signal\nfrom the mixed cell population of a tumor sample into its individual components\nare currently not available. Herein we propose a framework for deconvolving\ndata from a single genome-wide experiment to infer the composition, abundance\nand evolutionary paths of the underlying cell subpopulations of a tumor. The\nmethod is based on the plausible biological assumption that tumor progression\nis an evolutionary process where each individual aberration event stems from a\nunique subclone and is present in all its descendants subclones. We have\ndeveloped an efficient algorithm (TrAp) for solving this mixture problem. In\nsilico analyses show that TrAp correctly deconvolves mixed subpopulations when\nthe number of subpopulations and the measurement errors are moderate. We\ndemonstrate the applicability of the method using tumor karyotypes and somatic\nhypermutation datasets. We applied TrAp to SNV frequency profile from Exome-Seq\nexperiment of a renal cell carcinoma tumor sample and compared the mutational\nprofile of the inferred subpopulations to the mutational profiles of twenty\nsingle cells of the same tumor. Despite the large experimental noise, specific\nco-occurring mutations found in clones inferred by TrAp are also present in\nsome of these single cells. Finally, we deconvolve Exome-Seq data from three\ndistinct metastases from different body compartments of one melanoma patient\nand exhibit the evolutionary relationships of their subpopulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Jan 2013 20:48:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-07"}

We wish to investigate how effective dust can accumulate along the\nazimuthal direction.

While this\nis a good assumption for the IGM, analytic arguments suggest that local sources\nmay typically be more important than the background radiation for high column\ndensity absorbers (N_HI > 10^17 /cm^2). We post-process cosmological\nsimulations with accurate radiation transport to investigate the impact of\nlocal stellar sources on the HI distribution. We demonstrate that the limited\nnumerical resolution and the simplified treatment of the ISM that are typical\nof current cosmological simulations provide significant challenges, but that\nmany of the problems can be overcome by taking two steps. First, using ISM\nparticles rather than stellar particles as sources results in a much better\nsampling of the source distribution. Second, by rescaling the source\nluminosities so that the amount of radiation escaping into the IGM agrees with\nthat required to produce the observed background, many of the results become\ninsensitive to errors in the predicted fraction of the radiation that escapes\nthe immediate vicinity of the sources. By adopting this strategy and by varying\nthe assumptions about the structure of the unresolved ISM, we conclude that we\ncan robustly estimate the effect of local sources for column densities N_HI <<\n10^21 /cm^2.

Several mysteries cloud the interpretation\nof this event: (1) extreme flaring and `plateau' shape of the X-ray/gamma-ray\nlight curve during the first 10 days after the gamma-ray trigger; (2)\nunexpected rebrightening of the forward shock radio emission months after\ntrigger; (3) no obvious evidence for jet precession, despite misalignment\ntypically expected between the angular momentum of the accretion disk and BH;\n(4) recent abrupt shut-off in jet X-ray emission after 1.5 years. Here we show\nthat all of these seemingly disparate mysteries are naturally resolved by one\nassumption: the presence of strong magnetic flux Phi threading the BH.\nInitially, Phi is weak relative to high fall-back mass accretion rate, Mdot,\nand the disk and jets precess about the BH axis = our line of sight. As Mdot\ndrops, Phi becomes dynamically important and leads to a magnetically-arrested\ndisk (MAD). MAD naturally aligns disk and jet axis along the BH spin axis, but\nonly after a violent rearrangement phase (jet wobbling). This explains the\nerratic light curve at early times and the lack of precession at later times.\nWe use our model for Swift J1644+57 to constrain BH and disrupted star\nproperties, finding that a solar-mass main sequence star disrupted by a\nrelatively low mass, M~10^5-10^6 Msun, BH is consistent with the data, while a\nWD disruption (though still possible) is disfavored. The magnetic flux required\nto power Swift J1644+57 is too large to be supplied by the star itself, but it\ncould be collected from a quiescent `fossil' accretion disk present in the\ngalactic nucleus prior to the TD. The presence (lack of) of such a fossil disk\ncould be a deciding factor in what TD events are accompanied by powerful\njets.[abridged]\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Jan 2013 21:00:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Jan 2013 02:33:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

In an effort to better\nunderstand the possible connections between line widths and star formation, we\nhave characterized \\hi{} kinematics in a sample of nearby dwarf galaxies by\nco-adding line-of-sight spectra after removing the rotational velocity to\nproduce an average, global \\hi{} line profile. These \"superprofiles\" are\ncomposed of a central narrow peak (~6-10 km/s) with higher-velocity wings to\neither side that contain ~10-15% of the total flux. The superprofiles are all\nvery similar, indicating a universal global HI profile for dwarf galaxies. We\ncompare characteristics of the superprofiles to various galaxy properties, such\nas mass and measures of star formation (SF), with the assumption that the\nsuperprofile represents a turbulent peak with energetic wings to either side.\nWe use these quantities to derive average scale heights for the sample\ngalaxies. When comparing to physical properties, we find that the velocity\ndispersion of the central peak is correlated with $<\\Sigma_\\mathrm{HI}>$. The\nfraction of mass and characteristic velocity of the high velocity wings are\ncorrelated with measures of SF, consistent with the picture that SF drives\nsurrounding HI to higher velocities. While gravitational instabilities provide\ntoo little energy, the SF in the sample galaxies does provide enough energy\nthrough supernovae, with realistic estimates of the coupling efficiency, to\nproduce the observed superprofiles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Jan 2013 21:20:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 22 Mar 2013 18:55:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

Specifically, the SU transmits in the null space of the interference\nchannel to the PU. We present a new algorithm, called the One-Bit Null Space\nLearning Algorithm (OBNSLA), in which the SU learns the PU's null space by\nobserving a binary function that indicates whether the interference it inflicts\non the PU has increased or decreased in comparison to the SU's previous\ntransmitted signal. This function is obtained by listening to the PU\ntransmitted signal or control channel and extracting information from it about\nwhether the PU's Signal to Interference plus Noise power Ratio (SINR) has\nincreased or decreased.\n  In addition to introducing the OBNSLA, this paper provides a thorough\nconvergence analysis of this algorithm. The OBNSLA is shown to have a linear\nconvergence rate and an asymptotic quadratic convergence rate. Finally, we\nderive bounds on the interference that the SU inflicts on the PU as a function\nof a parameter determined by the SU. This lets the SU control the maximum level\nof interference, which enables it to protect the PU completely blindly with\nminimum complexity. The asymptotic analysis and the derived bounds also apply\nto the recently proposed Blind Null Space Learning Algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Jan 2013 04:38:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Oct 2013 07:34:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

Inspired by the SPORE project, we\npresent API Blender, an open-source solution to describe, interact with, and\nintegrate the most common social Web APIs. In this perspective, we first\nintroduce two new lightweight description formats for requests and services and\ndemonstrate their relevance with respect to current platform APIs. We present\nour Python implementation of API Blender and its features regarding\nauthentication, policy management and multi-platform data integration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Jan 2013 11:19:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-11"}

It is shown that the zero-temperature magnetization process of\nboth models is quite reminiscent and hence, one may obtain some insight into\nthe ground states of the quantum Heisenberg model from the rigorous results for\nthe Ising-Heisenberg model even though exact ground states for the\nIsing-Heisenberg model do not represent true ground states for the pure quantum\nHeisenberg model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Jan 2013 12:27:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 30 Jan 2013 10:43:55 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 18 Sep 2013 10:25:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

A degradation of the focus sharpness arises in general from\ngeometrical deformations and surface roughness, the former usually described by\ngeometrical optics and the latter by physical optics. In general, technological\ndevelopments are aimed at a very tight focusing, which requires the mirror\nprofile to comply with the nominal shape as much as possible and to keep the\nroughness at a negligible level. However, a deliberate deformation of the\nmirror can be made to endow the focus with a desired size and distribution, via\npiezo actuators as done at the EIS-TIMEX beamline of FERMI@Elettra. The\nresulting profile can be characterized with a Long Trace Profilometer and\ncorrelated with the expected optical quality via a wavefront propagation code.\nHowever, if the roughness contribution can be neglected, the computation can be\nperformed via a ray-tracing routine, and, under opportune assumptions, the\nfocal spot profile (the Point Spread Function, PSF) can even be predicted\nanalytically. The advantage of this approach is that the analytical relation\ncan be reversed; i.e, from the desired PSF the required mirror profile can be\ncomputed easily, thereby avoiding the use of complex and time-consuming\nnumerical codes. The method can also be suited in the case of spatially\ninhomogeneous beam intensities, as commonly experienced at Synchrotrons and\nFELs.

The sample stars span\na large range of properties such as mass-loss rate and photospheric C/O-ratio.\nThe analysis of the new data allows for more accurate estimates of the\ncircumstellar HCN abundances and puts new constraints on chemical models. In\norder to constrain the circumstellar HCN abundance distribution a detailed\nnon-LTE excitation analysis, based on the Monte Carlo method, is performed.\nEffects of line overlaps and radiative excitation from dust grains are\nincluded. The median values for the derived abundances of HCN (with respect to\nH2) are 3x10-5, 7x10-7 and 10-7 for carbon stars (25 stars), S-type AGB stars\n(19 stars) and M-type AGB stars (25 stars), respectively.

The derived HCN abundances of the\nS-type AGB stars have a larger spread and typically fall in between those of\nthe two other types, however, slightly closer to the values for the M-type AGB\nstars. For the M-type stars, the estimated abundances are much higher than what\nwould be expected if HCN is formed in thermal equilibrium. However, the results\nare also in contrast to predictions from recent non-LTE chemical models, where\nvery little difference is expected in the HCN abundances between the various\ntypes of AGB stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Jan 2013 14:15:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

It can operate in\npartially observable environments (in the case of missing observations or data)\nby maintaining belief states about patient health status and functions as an\nonline agent that plans and re-plans.

We study the dust content of a large optical input sample of 910\nearly-type galaxies (ETG) in the Virgo cluster, extending also to the dwarf\nETG, and examine the results in relation with those on the other cold ISM\ncomponents. Methods. We searched for far-infrared emission in all galaxies of\nthe input sample using the 250 micron image of the Herschel Virgo Cluster\nSurvey (HeViCS). This image covers a large fraction of the cluster. For the\ndetected ETG we measured fluxes in 5 bands from 100 to 500 micron, and\nestimated the dust mass and temperature with modified black-body fits. Results.\nDust is detected above the completeness limit of 25.4 mJy at 250 micron in 46\nETG, 43 of which are in the optically complete part of the input sample. In\naddition dust is present at fainter levels in another 6 ETG. We detect dust in\nthe 4 ETG with synchrotron emission, including M 87. Dust appears to be much\nmore concentrated than stars and more luminous ETG have higher dust\ntemperatures. Dust detection rates down to the 25.4 mJy limit are 17% for\nellipticals, about 40% for lenticulars (S0 + S0a) and around 3% for dwarf ETG.\nDust mass does not correlate clearly with stellar mass and is often much more\nthan that expected for a passive galaxy in a closed-box model. The\ndust-to-stars mass ratio anticorrelates with galaxy luminosity, and for some\ndwarf ETG reaches values as high as for dusty late-type galaxies. In the Virgo\ncluster slow rotators appear more likely to contain dust than fast ones.\nComparing the dust results with those on HI from ALFALFA, there are only 8 ETG\ndetected both in dust and in HI in the HeViCS area; 39 have dust but only an\nupper limit on HI, and 8 have HI but only an upper limit on dust. The locations\nof these galaxies in the cluster are different, with the dusty ETG concentrated\nin the densest regions, while the HI rich ETG are at the periphery.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Jan 2013 15:32:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 1 Feb 2013 16:20:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

However, model-based clustering\nmethods for categorical data are less standard. Latent class analysis is a\ncommonly used method for model-based clustering of binary data and/or\ncategorical data, but due to an assumed local independence structure there may\nnot be a correspondence between the estimated latent classes and groups in the\npopulation of interest. The mixture of latent trait analyzers model extends\nlatent class analysis by assuming a model for the categorical response\nvariables that depends on both a categorical latent class and a continuous\nlatent trait variable; the discrete latent class accommodates group structure\nand the continuous latent trait accommodates dependence within these groups.\nFitting the mixture of latent trait analyzers model is potentially difficult\nbecause the likelihood function involves an integral that cannot be evaluated\nanalytically. We develop a variational approach for fitting the mixture of\nlatent trait models and this provides an efficient model fitting strategy. The\nmixture of latent trait analyzers model is demonstrated on the analysis of data\nfrom the National Long Term Care Survey (NLTCS) and voting in the U.S.\nCongress. The model is shown to yield intuitive clustering results and it gives\na much better fit than either latent class analysis or latent trait analysis\nalone.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Jan 2013 15:45:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 Feb 2013 18:00:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-20"}
