Such differences can be measured by labeled\ncortical distance mapping (LCDM) which characterizes the morphometry of the\nlaminar cortical mantle of cortical structures. LCDM data consist of signed\ndistances of gray matter (GM) voxels with respect to GM/white matter (WM)\nsurface. Volumes and descriptive measures (such as means and variances) for\neach subject and the pooled distances provide the morphometric differences\nbetween diagnostic groups, but they do not reveal all the morphometric\ninformation contained in LCDM distances. To extract more information from LCDM\ndata, censoring of the distances is introduced. For censoring of LCDM\ndistances, the range of LCDM distances is partitioned at a fixed increment\nsize; and at each censoring step, and distances not exceeding the censoring\ndistance are kept. Censored LCDM distances inherit the advantages of the pooled\ndistances. Furthermore, the analysis of censored distances provides information\nabout the location of morphometric differences which cannot be obtained from\nthe pooled distances. However, at each step, the censored distances aggregate,\nwhich might confound the results. The influence of data aggregation is\ninvestigated with an extensive Monte Carlo simulation analysis and it is\ndemonstrated that this influence is negligible. As an illustrative example, GM\nof ventral medial prefrontal cortices (VMPFCs) of subjects with major\ndepressive disorder (MDD), subjects at high risk (HR) of MDD, and healthy\ncontrol (Ctrl) subjects are used. A significant reduction in laminar thickness\nof the VMPFC and perhaps shrinkage in MDD and HR subjects is observed when\ncompared to Ctrl subjects. The methodology is also applicable to LCDM-based\nmorphometric measures of other cortical structures affected by disease.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Jan 2013 19:28:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-22"}

The expectations for next generations on issues like throughput,\nrange, reliability, and power consumption are even higher. This is quite a\nchallenge considering all the work already done. Cross-layer optimization of\nphysical (PHY) and medium access control (MAC) layers can be an interesting\nexploration path for further enhancement. During this thesis we have studied\ncross-layer optimization techniques, with a focus on the IEEE 802.11ac\nstandard. A new multichannel aggregation scheme involving cross-knowledge\nbetween PHY and MAC layers has been proposed to improve performance in\ncollision-prone environments. We have shown that some functionalities directly\ninvolved PHY and MAC layers. An accurate modeling of both PHY and MAC\nmechanisms is thus needed to have a realistic characterization of such\nfunctionalities. A cross-layer simulator, compliant with IEEE 802.11ac\nspecifications, has thus been implemented. To the best of our knowledge, this\nis the first simulator incorporating detailed PHY and MAC functionalities for\nthe IEEE 802.11ac standard. The multiple-user multiple-input, multiple-output\n(MU-MIMO) technique, which is one of the main innovations of the IEEE 802.11ac,\nneeds both PHY and MAC layer considerations. We have thus used the implemented\ncross-layer simulator to evaluate the performance of MU-MIMO and compared it\nwith the single-user MIMO (SU-MIMO). The aim of these studies was to evaluate\nthe 'real' gains of MU-MIMO solutions (accounting for PHY+MAC) over SU-MIMO\nsolutions and not the generally accepted ones. The impact of the channel\nsounding interval has particularly been studied. Finally, we have proposed a\nshort PHY layer version of acknowledgment frames for overhead reduction in IEEE\n802.11ah communications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Jan 2013 21:10:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-22"}

We assume that the two\nsystems are designed to operate independently, but want to help each other\nrespond to unexpected overloads. The proposed overload control automatically\nactivates sharing (sending some customers from one system to the other) once a\nratio of the queue lengths in the two systems crosses an activation threshold\n(with ratio and activation threshold parameters for each direction). To prevent\nharmful sharing, sharing is allowed in only one direction at any time. In this\npaper, we are primarily concerned with ensuring that the system recovers\nrapidly after the overload is over, either (i) because the two systems return\nto normal loading or (ii) because the direction of the overload suddenly shifts\nin the opposite direction. To achieve rapid recovery, we introduce lower\nthresholds for the queue ratios, below which one-way sharing is released. As a\nbasis for studying the complex dynamics, we develop a new six-dimensional fluid\napproximation for a system with time-varying arrival rates, extending a\nprevious fluid approximation involving a stochastic averaging principle. We\nconduct simulations to confirm that the new algorithm is effective for\npredicting the system performance and choosing effective control parameters.\nThe simulation and the algorithm both show that the system can experience an\ninefficient nearly-periodic behavior, corresponding to an oscillating\nequilibrium (congestion collapse), if the sharing is strongly inefficient and\nthe control parameters are set inappropriately.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Jan 2013 00:10:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Jul 2014 16:33:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-30"}

Its\nphysical significance is that it can diagnose whether any given multi-layer\nmodel that allows co-existing downscale cascades of energy and potential\nenstrophy can allow the downscale energy flux to become large enough to yield a\nmixed energy spectrum where the dominant $k^{-3}$ scaling is overtaken by a\nsubdominant $k^{-5/3}$ contribution beyond a transition wavenumber $k_t$\nsituated in the inertial range. The validity of the flux inequality implies\nthat this scaling transition cannot occur within the inertial range, whereas a\nviolation of the flux inequality beyond some wavenumber $k_t$ implies the\nexistence of a scaling transition near that wavenumber. This flux inequality\nholds unconditionally in two-dimensional Navier-Stokes turbulence, however, it\nis far from obvious that it continues to hold in multi-layer quasi-geostrophic\nmodels, because the dissipation rate spectra for energy and potential enstrophy\nno longer relate in a trivial way, as in two-dimensional Navier-Stokes.

Our measure aims to\ncapture the incompatibility of noncommuting observables as manifest in the\nnon-orthogonality of their eigenstates. We prove that this measure has all the\ndesired properties: it is zero when the observables commute, strictly greater\nthan zero when they do not, and is maximum when they are mutually unbiased. We\nalso obtain tight upper bounds on this measure for any N noncommuting\nobservables and compute it exactly when the observables are mutually unbiased.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Jan 2013 06:25:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 May 2013 04:57:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

Based on the ample information about their timing behaviors, spectra,\nand variability properties, it was proposed that SGRs/AXPs are isolated neutron\nstars (NSs) with extremely strong magnetic fields, the so-called magnetars.\nNonetheless, some alternative models are probably equally convincing such as\nthose proposing that they are accreting NSs with a fall-back disk or\nrotation-powered magnetized and massive white dwarfs. The nature and nurture of\nSGRs/AXPs remain controversial. In this paper, we propose that SGRs/AXPs can\noriginate from normal NSs in binary systems. SGRs are a class of objects\ncontaining a neutron-drip core and denser crust with a stiffer equation of\nstate, which is formed from re-explosion of normal NSs in binary systems. It is\nthe accretion onto the denser crust that contributes to the observed hard\nemissions. AXPs are a group of NSs which reserve huge thermal energy in an\ninsulating layer above the surface. This structure accretes material from a\nmassive disk, manifesting themselves via release of deposited energy.

From these results follows the\nmain conclusion that the atomistic region exchanges molecules with the\ncoarse-grained region in a Grand Canonical fashion with an accuracy up to (at\nleast) second order. Numerical tests, for the relevant case of liquid water at\nambient conditions, are carried out to strengthen the conclusions of the\ntheoretical analysis. Finally, in order to show the computational convenience\nof AdResS as a Grand Canonical set up, we compare our method to the Insertion\nParticle Method (IMP) in its most efficient computational implementation. This\nfruitful combination of theoretical principles and numerical evidence\ncandidates the adaptive resolution technique as a natural, general and\nefficient protocol for Grand Canonical Molecular Dynamics for the case of large\nsystems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Jan 2013 10:20:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-13"}

The approach employs a ranking function that\navoids sorting the points directly thus reducing the overall time complexity.\nThe ranked points create a simple polygonal chain from which the Convex Hull\ncan be found using a suitable O(n) method. The result is achieved by placing a\nbound on the density (or ratio) of points to m, where m is the maximum value of\nthe ranking function required to represent the set of points yielding an O(n+m)\nmethod. A fast method is then developed based on the bit length, p, of the data\nset which reduces this time further. The required conditions are easily\nsatisfied by image processing methods which determine the Hulls of polygonal\nregions where the densities are in the range of 3%.

The correlation between galaxy luminosities and\nrotation rates can be used to determine distances to many thousands of galaxies\nin a wide range of environments potentially out to 200 Mpc. Mid-infrared (3.6\nmicrons) photometry with the Spitzer Space Telescope is particularly valuable\nas the source of the luminosities because it provides products of uniform\nquality across the sky. From a perch above the atmosphere, essentially the\ntotal magnitude of targets can be registered in exposures of a few minutes.\nExtinction is minimal and the flux is dominated by the light from old stars\nwhich is expected to correlate with the mass of the targets.\n  In spite of the superior photometry, the correlation between mid-infrared\nluminosities and rotation rates extracted from neutral hydrogen profiles is\nslightly degraded from the correlation found with I band luminosities. A color\ncorrection recovers a correlation that provides comparable accuracy to that\navailable at I band (~20% 1sigma in an individual distance) while retaining the\nadvantages identified above. Without the color correction the relation between\nlinewidth and [3.6] magnitudes is M^{b,i,k,a}_{[3.6]} = -20.34 - 9.74 (log\nW_{mx}^{i} -2.5).

We present a systematic and\nrigorous search for spectral deviations from a Band function at low energies in\na sample of the first two years of high fluence, long bursts detected by the\n\\textit{Fermi} Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GBM). The sample contains 45 bursts\nwith a fluence greater than 2$\\times10^{-5}$ erg / cm$^{2}$ (10 - 1000 keV). An\nextrapolated fit method is used to search for low-energy spectral anomalies,\nwhereby a Band function is fit above a variable low-energy threshold and then\nthe best fit function is extrapolated to lower energy data.

The method represents the evolution of the probability density\nfunction (PDF) in phase space, $p_{\\x}(\\x',t)$, discretized on a fixed\nCartesian grid over {\\it all} of phase space, and consists of two main steps:\n(i) Between measurement times, $p_{\\x}(\\x',t)$ is evolved via numerical\ndiscretization of the Kolmogorov forward equation, using a Godunov method with\nsecond-order corner transport upwind correction and a total variation\ndiminishing flux limiter; (ii) at measurement times, $p_{\\x}(\\x',t)$ is updated\nvia Bayes' theorem.

A random variable is usually described by the\nprobability density function (PDF) or by its Fourier transform, namely the\ncharacteristic function (CF). The CF can be further expressed by a Taylor\nseries involving the moments of the random variable. However, in some\ncircumstances, the moments do not exist and the Taylor expansion of the CF is\nuseless. This happens for example in the case of $\\alpha$--stable random\nvariables. Here, the problem of representing the CF or the PDF of random\nvariables (r.vs) is examined by introducing fractional calculus. Two very\nremarkable results are obtained. Firstly, it is shown that the fractional\nderivatives of the CF in zero coincide with fractional moments. This is true\nalso in case of CF not derivable in zero (like the CF of $\\alpha$--stable\nr.vs). Moreover, it is shown that the CF may be represented by a generalized\nTaylor expansion involving fractional moments. The generalized Taylor series\nproposed is also able to represent the PDF in a perfect dual representation to\nthat in terms of CF. The PDF representation in terms of fractional moments is\nespecially accurate in the tails and this is very important in engineering\nproblems, like estimating structural safety.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Jan 2013 13:42:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-22"}

Thus the extremely metal-poor nature of M49's extended\nhalo provides some tension against current models for elliptical galaxy\nformation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Jan 2013 15:47:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 30 Jan 2013 17:12:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}
