The visible manifestations of these spectral features are\nankle, beginning of GZK cutoff in the differential spectrum and E_{1/2} in\nintegral spectrum. Observed in all experiments, the ankle is usually\ninterpreted as transition from galactic to extragalactic cosmic rays. Using the\nmass composition measured by HiRes, Telescope Array (TA) and Auger detectors at\nenergy (1-3) EeV, calculated anisotropy of galactic cosmic rays at these\nenergies, and the elongation curves we strongly argue against the\ninterpretation of the ankle given above. The transition must occur at lower\nenergy, most probably at the second knee as the dip model predicts. The other\nprediction of this model, the shape of the dip, is well confirmed by HiRes, TA,\nAGASA and Yakutsk detectors, and, after recalibration of energies, by Auger\ndetector. Predicted beginning of GZK cutoff and E_{1/2} agree well with HiRes\nand TA data. However, directly measured mass composition remains a puzzle.\nWhile HiRes and TA detectors observe the proton-dominated mass composition, as\nrequired by the dip model, the data of Auger detector strongly evidence for\nnuclei mass composition becoming steadily heavier at energy higher than 4 EeV\nand reaching Iron at energy about 35 EeV. The Auger-based scenario is\nconsistent with another interpretation of the ankle at energy E_a=4 EeV as\ntransition from extragalactic protons to extragalactic nuclei. The heavy-\nnuclei dominance at higher energies may be provided by low-energy of\nacceleration for protons E_{max} \\sim 4 EeV and rigidity-dependent E_{max}^A =Z\nE_{max}$ for nuclei. The highest energy suppression may be explained as\nnuclei-destroying cutoff.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Jan 2013 16:09:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 20 Apr 2013 18:02:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-20"}

As an objective function, the existing heuristic function\nthat construct the solution of the problem in traditional way is used.

In a variety of MARC settings, the dynamic decode and\nforward (DDF) protocol is very useful due to its outstanding rate performance.\nHowever, the lack of good structured codebooks so far hinders practical\napplications of DDF for MARC. In this work, two classes of structured MARC\ncodes are proposed: 1) one-to-one relay-mapper aided multiuser lattice coding\n(O-MLC), and 2) modulo-sum relay-mapper aided multiuser lattice coding\n(MS-MLC). The former enjoys better rate performance, while the latter provides\nmore flexibility to tradeoff between the complexity of the relay mapper and the\nrate performance. It is shown that, in order to approach the rate performance\nachievable by an unstructured codebook with maximum-likelihood decoding, it is\ncrucial to use a new K-stage coset decoder for structured O-MLC, instead of the\none-stage decoder proposed in previous works. However, if O-MLC is decoded with\nthe one-stage decoder only, it can still achieve the optimal DDF\ndiversity-multiplexing gain tradeoff in the high signal-to-noise ratio regime.\nAs for MS-MLC, its rate performance can approach that of the O-MLC by\nincreasing the complexity of the modulo-sum relay-mapper. Finally, for\npractical implementations of both O-MLC and MS-MLC, practical short length\nlattice codes with linear mappers are designed, which facilitate efficient\nlattice decoding. Simulation results show that the proposed coding schemes\noutperform existing schemes in terms of outage probabilities in a variety of\nchannel settings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Jan 2013 19:48:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-08"}

They also promise\na lower power consumption due to coherent combining at the receiver. However,\nthe receiver processing in the uplink relies on the channel estimates which are\nknown to suffer from pilot interference. In this work, we perform an uplink\nlarge system analysis of multi-cell multi-antenna system when the receiver\nemploys a matched filtering with a pilot contaminated estimate. We find the\nasymptotic Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio (SINR) as the number of\nantennas and number of users per base station grow large while maintaining a\nfixed ratio. To do this, we make use of the similarity of the uplink received\nsignal in a multi-antenna system to the representation of the received signal\nin CDMA systems. The asymptotic SINR expression explicitly captures the effect\nof pilot contamination and that of interference averaging. This also explains\nthe SINR performance of receiver processing schemes at different regimes such\nas instances when the number of antennas are comparable to number of users as\nwell as when antennas exceed greatly the number of users.

A major obstacle that poses an existential threat to practical\ndeployment of conventional approaches to distributed coding is the exponential\ngrowth of the decoder complexity with the number of sources and the encoding\nrates. This growth in complexity renders many traditional approaches\nimpractical even for moderately sized networks. In this paper, we propose a new\ndecoding paradigm for large scale distributed compression wherein the decoder\ncomplexity is explicitly controlled during the design. Central to our approach\nis a module called the \"bit-subset selector\" whose role is to judiciously\nextract an appropriate subset of the received bits for decoding per individual\nsource. We propose a practical design strategy, based on deterministic\nannealing (DA) for the joint design of the system components, that enables\ndirect optimization of the decoder complexity-distortion trade-off, and thereby\nthe desired scalability. We also point out the direct connections between the\nproblem of large scale distributed compression and a related problem in sensor\nnetworks, namely, dispersive information routing of correlated sources. This\nallows us to extend the design principles proposed in the context of large\nscale distributed compression to design efficient routers for minimum cost\ncommunication of correlated sources across a network.

As such, they hold potential to reveal insights into arthropod\nevolution. Recent phylogenetic analyses have supported their position as either\nbasal chelicerates or as a separate, fifth major lineage of extant arthropods.\nDisagreements concerning pycnogonid relations to other arthropods is partly a\nproduct of too few primary observations of pycnogonid anatomy and development.\nThis investigation of post-embryonic development of the pycnogonid\nAnoplodactylus eroticus employs multiple techniques of anatomical observation,\nincluding Nomarski optics, scanning electron microscopy and fluorescence\nmicroscopy, in order to thoroughly document the life cycle.\n  After the second post-embryonic stage, larvae of A. eroticus burrow within a\nhydroid and undergo morphogenesis.

MSMs are\ntypically built from numerous molecular dynamics simulations by dividing the\nsampled configurations into a large number of microstates based on geometric\ncriteria. The resulting microstate model can then be coarse-grained into a more\nunderstandable macro state model by lumping together rapidly mixing microstates\ninto larger, metastable aggregates. However, finite sampling often results in\nthe creation of many poorly sampled microstates. During coarse-graining, these\nstates are mistakenly identified as being kinetically important because\ntransitions to/from them appear to be slow. In this paper we propose a\nformalism based on an algebraic principle for matrix approximation, i.e. the\nNystrom method, to deal with such poorly sampled microstates. Our scheme builds\na hierarchy of microstates from high to low populations and progressively\napplies spectral clustering on sets of microstates within each level of the\nhierarchy. It helps spectral clustering identify metastable aggregates with\nhighly populated microstates rather than being distracted by lowly populated\nstates. We demonstrate the ability of this algorithm to discover the major\nmetastable states on two model systems, the alanine dipeptide and TrpZip2.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Jan 2013 04:33:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

It is one of the key questions to deepen our understanding of\nthe mechanisms and processes of energy accumulation and sudden release in ARs\nand to improve our capability of space weather prediction. Although some case\nstudies have been made, the question is still far from fully answered. This\nissue is now being tried to address statistically through an investigation of\nwaiting times of quasi-homologous CMEs from super ARs in solar cycle 23. It is\nfound that the waiting times of quasi-homologous CMEs have a two-component\ndistribution with a separation at about 18 hours. The first component is a\nGaussian-like distribution with a peak at about 7 hours, which indicates a\ntight physical connection between these quasi-homologous CMEs. The likelihood\nof occurrences of two or more CMEs faster than 1200 km s-1 from the same AR\nwithin 18 hours is about 20%. Furthermore, the correlation analysis among CME\nwaiting times, CME speeds and CME occurrence rates reveals that these\nquantities are independent to each other, suggesting that the perturbation by\npreceding CMEs rather than free energy input be the direct cause of\nquasi-homologous CMEs. The peak waiting time of 7 hours probably characterize\nthe time scale of the growth of instabilities triggered by preceding CMEs. This\nstudy uncovers more clues from a statistical perspective for us to understand\nquasi-homologous CMEs as well as CME-rich ARs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Jan 2013 09:05:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-24"}

We present the investigation of\nvariability caused by rotation and (gammaDoradus-type) pulsation in two\npre-main sequence members of the young open cluster NGC2264 using\nhigh-precision time series photometry from the CoRoT satellite and dedicated\nhigh-resolution spectroscopy. Time series photometry of NGC2264VAS20 and NGC\n2264VAS87 was obtained by the CoRoT satellite during the dedicated short run\nSRa01 in March 2008. NGC2264VAS87 was re-observed by CoRoT during the short run\nSRa05 in December 2011 and January 2012. Frequency analysis was conducted using\nPeriod04 and SigSpec. The spectral analysis was performed using equivalent\nwidths and spectral synthesis. The frequency analysis yielded 10 and 14\nintrinsic frequencies for NGC2264VAS20 and NGC2264VAS 87, respectively, in the\nrange from 0 to 1.5c/d which are attributed to be caused by a combination of\nrotation and pulsation. The effective temperatures were derived to be\n6380$\\pm$150K for NGC2264VAS20 and 6220$\\pm$150K for NGC2264VAS87. Membership\nof the two stars to the cluster is confirmed independently using X-ray fluxes,\nradial velocity measurements and proper motions available in the literature.\nThe derived Li abundances of log n(Li)=3.34 and 3.54 for NGC2264VAS20 and\nNGC2264VAS87, respectively, are in agreement with the Li abundance for other\nstars in NGC2264 of similar Teff reported in the literature. We conclude that\nthe two objects are members of NGC2264 and therefore are in their pre-main\nsequence evolutionary stage. Assuming that part of their variability is caused\nby pulsation, these two stars might be the first pre-main sequence gamma\nDoradus candidates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Jan 2013 10:38:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

Tuning and\nselectivity of cortical neurons in mouse visual cortex is not equivocally\nresolved so far. While many in-vivo experimental studies found inhibitory\nneurons of all subtypes to be broadly tuned for orientation other studies\nreport inhibitory neurons that are as sharply tuned as excitatory neurons.\nThese diverging findings about the selectivity of excitatory and inhibitory\ncortical neurons prompted us to ask the following questions: (1) How different\nor similar is the cortical computation with that in previously described\nspecies that relies on map? (2) What is the network mechanism underlying the\nsharpening of orientation selectivity in the mouse primary visual cortex? Here,\nwe investigate the above questions in a computational framework with a\nrecurrent network composed of Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) point neurons. Our cortical\nnetwork with random connectivity alone could not account for all the\nexperimental observations, which led us to hypothesize, (a) Orientation\ndependent connectivity (b) Feedforward afferent specificity to understand\norientation selectivity of V1 neurons in mouse. Using population (orientation\nselectivity index) OSI as a measure of neuronal selectivity to stimulus\norientation we test each hypothesis separately and in combination against\nexperimental data. Based on our analysis of orientation selectivity (OS) data\nwe find a good fit of network parameters in a model based on afferent\nspecificity and connectivity that scales with feature similarity.

A repair (or possible world) of such database is\nobtained by selecting a maximal number of tuples without ever selecting two\ndistinct tuples with the same primary key value. For a Boolean query q, the\ndecision problem CERTAINTY(q) takes as input an uncertain database db and asks\nwhether q is satisfied by every repair of db. Our main focus is on acyclic\nBoolean conjunctive queries without self-join. Previous work has introduced the\nnotion of (directed) attack graph of such queries, and has proved that\nCERTAINTY(q) is first-order expressible if and only if the attack graph of q is\nacyclic. The current paper investigates the boundary between tractability and\nintractability of CERTAINTY(q). We first classify cycles in attack graphs as\neither weak or strong, and then prove among others the following. If the attack\ngraph of a query q contains a strong cycle, then CERTAINTY(q) is coNP-complete.\nIf the attack graph of q contains no strong cycle and every weak cycle of it is\nterminal (i.e., no edge leads from a vertex in the cycle to a vertex outside\nthe cycle), then CERTAINTY(q) is in P.

For each\nmodel we qualitatively study the structure of its associated gravitational\nconfigurations, which can be asymptotically \\emph{Schwarzschild-like} or with\nan anomalous \\emph{non Schwarzschild-like} behaviour at $r \\rightarrow \\infty$\n(but being asymptotically flat and well behaved anyhow). The extension of these\nresults to the non-abelian case is also briefly considered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Jan 2013 14:31:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-08"}

In this paper, we\nintroduce new algorithm of visibility, \"cross-visibility\", which reveals the\nconjugation of two coupled time series. The correspondence between the two time\nseries is mapped to a network, \"the cross-visibility graph\", to demonstrate the\ncorrelation between them. We applied the algorithm to several correlated and\nuncorrelated time series, generated by the linear stationary ARFIMA process.\nThe results demonstrate that the cross-visibility graph associated with\ncorrelated time series with power-law auto-correlation is scale-free. If the\ntime series are uncorrelated, the degree distribution of their cross-visibility\nnetwork deviates from power-law. For more clarifying the process, we applied\nthe algorithm to real-world data from the financial trades of two companies,\nand observed significant small-scale coupling in their dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Jan 2013 14:35:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

It is found\nthat the variational energy of a projected Fermi sea is lowered by introducing\nan anisotropy between the hopping integrals along the x and y directions. Our\nresults show that the $d$FSD state has the strongest tendency at half-filling\nin the absence of magnetism, and disappears as the hole concentration increases\nto $n_h\\approx 1.15$. This is qualitatively in agreement with the mean field\nanalysis and the exact diagonalization calculation for the one-band models, and\nprovides a qualitative explanation to the \"intra-unit-cell\" electronic\nnematicity revealed by the scanning tunneling microscopy. An analysis of the\ndependence of $d$FSD on the parameters of the three-band model indicates that\nthe copper on-site Coulomb interaction, the nearest-neighbor copper-oxygen\nrepulsion, and the charge-transfer energy have a remarkable positive effect on\n$d$FSD.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Jan 2013 15:23:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}
