High-resolution, hard x-ray photoemission is used to uncover the\noccupation of Ti 3d states and the relative energetic alignment - and hence\ninternal electric fields - within the LaAlO3 layer. Firstly, the Ti 2p core\nlevel spectra clearly show occupation of Ti 3d states already for two unit\ncells of LaAlO3. Secondly, the LaAlO3 core levels were seen to shift to lower\nbinding energy as the LaAlO3 overlayer thickness, n, was increased - agreeing\nwith the expectations from the canonical electron transfer model for the\nemergence of conductivity at the interface. However, not only is the energy\noffset of only 300meV between n=2 (insulating interface) and n=6 (metallic\ninterface) an order of magnitude smaller than the simple expectation, but it is\nalso clearly not the sum of a series of unit-cell by unit-cell shifts within\nthe LaAlO3 block. Both of these facts argue against the simple charge-transfer\npicture involving a cumulative shift of the LaAlO3 valence bands above the\nSrTiO3 conduction bands, resulting in charge transfer only for n>3. Turning to\nthe theoretical data, our density functional simulations show that the presence\nof oxygen vacancies at the LaAlO3 surface at the 25% level reverses the\ndirection of the internal field in the LaAlO3. Therefore, taking the\nexperimental and theoretical results together, a consistent picture emerges for\nreal-life samples in which nature does not wait until n=4 and already for n=2,\nmechanisms other than internal-electric-field-driven electron transfer from\nidealized LaAlO3 to near-interfacial states in the SrTiO3 substrate are active\nin heading off the incipient polarization catastrophe that drives the physics\nin these systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Jan 2013 16:47:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 Feb 2013 14:04:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

A new message arrives at\nthe beginning of each coherence block, and the decoder is required to output\neach message sequentially, after a delay of $T$ coherence blocks. In the\nspecial case when $T=1$, the setup reduces to the quasi-static fading channel.\nWe establish the optimal diversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT) in the high\nsignal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) regime, and show that it equals $T$ times the DMT\nof the quasi-static channel. The converse is based on utilizing the delay\nconstraint to amplify a local outage event associated with a message, globally\nacross all the coherence blocks. This approach appears to be new. We propose\ntwo coding schemes that achieve the optimal DMT. The first scheme involves\ninterleaving of messages, such that each message is transmitted across $T$\nconsecutive coherence blocks. This scheme requires the knowledge of the delay\nconstraint at both the encoder and decoder. Our second coding scheme involves a\nsequential tree code and is delay-universal i.e., the knowledge of the decoding\ndelay is not required by the encoder. However, in this scheme we require the\ncoherence block-length to increase as $\\log\\mathrm{({SNR})}$, in order to\nattain the optimal DMT. Finally, we discuss the case when multiple messages\narrive at uniform intervals {\\em within} each coherence period.

However, the\nlist of icy minor bodies moving in orbits with an inclination above 40 deg. has\nincreased in recent years. The origin of these bodies, and in particular of\nthose objects in retrograde orbits, is not well determined, and different\nscenarios are considered. In this paper, we present new observational and\ndynamical data of two objects in retrograde orbits, 2008 YB3 and 2005 VD. We\nfind that the surface of these extreme objects is depleted of ices and does not\ncontain the 'ultra-red' matter typical of some Centaurs. Despite small\ndifferences, these objects share common colors and spectral characteristics\nwith the Trojans, comet nuclei, and the group of grey Centaurs. All of these\npopulations are supposed to be covered by a mantle of dust responsible for\ntheir reddish- to neutral-color. To investigate if the surface properties and\ndynamical evolution of these bodies are related, we integrate their orbits for\n10^(8) years to the past. We find a remarkable difference in their dynamical\nevolutions: 2005 VD' s evolution is dominated by a Kozai resonance with planet\nJupiter while that of 2008 YB3 is dominated by close encounters with planets\nJupiter and Saturn. Our models suggest that the immediate site of provenance of\n2005 VD is the in the Oort cloud, whereas for 2008 YB3 it is in the\ntrans-Neptunian region. Additionally, the study of their residence time shows\nthat 2005 VD has spent a larger lapse of time moving in orbits in the region of\nthe giant planets than 2008 YB3. Together with the small differences in color\nbetween these two objects, with 2005 VD being more neutral than 2008 YB3, this\nfact suggests that the surface of 2005 VD has suffered a higher degree of\nprocessing, probably related to cometary activity episodes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Jan 2013 17:12:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-11"}

To improve this decision support system and to give more and more\nrelevant information to the user, the need to integrate user's profiles into\nthe data warehouse process becomes crucial. In this paper, we propose to\nexploit users' preferences as a basis for adapting OLAP (On-Line Analytical\nProcessing) queries to the user. For this, we present a user profile-driven\ndata warehouse approach that allows dening user's profile composed by his/her\nidentifier and a set of his/her preferences.

Then, when a user query is\nsubmitted to the data warehouse, the system deals with his/her data warehouse\nmaterialized view instead of the whole data warehouse.

We associate\nthis region with the solar corona. We find solar-like differential rotation\nwith radial contours of constant rotation rate, together with a near-surface\nshear layer. This non-cylindrical rotation profile is caused by a non-zero\nlatitudinal entropy gradient that offsets the Taylor--Proudman balance through\nthe baroclinic term. The meridional circulation is multi-cellular with a\nsolar-like poleward flow near the surface at low latitudes. In most of the\ncases, the mean magnetic field is oscillatory with equatorward migration in two\ncases. In other cases, the equatorward migration is overlaid by stationary or\neven poleward migrating mean fields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Jan 2013 20:57:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Apr 2013 16:11:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 23 Sep 2013 14:51:27 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 13 Nov 2013 08:54:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-14"}

Animportant subclass of hybrid\nBNs are conditional linear Gaussian (CLG) networks, where the conditional\ndistribution of the continuous variables given an assignment to the discrete\nvariables is a multivariate Gaussian. Lauritzen's extension to the clique tree\nalgorithm can be used for exact inference in CLG networks.

No exact inference\nalgorithm has been proposed for these enhanced CLG networks. In this paper, we\ngeneralize Lauritzen's algorithm, providing the first \"exact\" inference\nalgorithm for augmented CLG networks - networks where continuous nodes are\nconditional linear Gaussians but that also allow discrete children ofcontinuous\nparents. Our algorithm is exact in the sense that it computes the exact\ndistributions over the discrete nodes, and the exact first and second moments\nof the continuous ones, up to the accuracy obtained by numerical integration\nused within thealgorithm. When the discrete children are modeled with softmax\nCPDs (as is the case in many real world domains) the approximation of the\ncontinuous distributions using the first two moments is particularly accurate.\nOur algorithm is simple to implement and often comparable in its complexity to\nLauritzen's algorithm.

Even though these findings\nwould point toward a significant acceleration of galaxy evolution in densest\nenvironments, we cannot exclude the importance of the mass as the main\nevolutionary driving element either. The latter effect may indeed be justified\nby the similarity of our composite passive spectrum with the luminous red\ngalaxies template at intermediate redshift.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Jan 2013 21:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

However, we caution that a power law treatment\noversimplifies the topic given that we observe correlations between t_dep^mol\nand other local and global quantities. The strongest of these are a decreased\nt_dep^mol in low-mass, low-metallicity galaxies and a correlation of the\nkpc-scale t_dep^mol with dust-to-gas ratio, D/G. These correlations can be\nexplained by a CO-to-H2 conversion factor that depends on D/G in the\ntheoretically expected way. This is not a unique interpretation, but external\nevidence of conversion factor variations makes it a conservative one. After\napplying a D/G-dependent alpha_CO, some weak correlations between t_dep^mol and\nlocal conditions persist. In particular, we observe lower t_dep^mol and\nenhanced CO excitation associated with some nuclear gas concentrations.

We have acquired near-infrared (NIR) spectra\nof AGNs up to z ~ 1.8 in the COSMOS and Extended Chandra Deep Field-South\nSurvey, with the Fiber Multi-Object Spectrograph (FMOS) mounted on the Subaru\nTelescope. These low-resolution NIR spectra provide a significant detection of\nthe broad Halpha line that has been shown to be a reliable probe of black hole\nmass at low redshift. Our sample has existing optical spectroscopy which\nprovides a detection of MgII, a broad emission line typically used for black\nhole mass estimation at z > 1. We carry out a spectral-line fitting procedure\nusing both Halpha and MgII to determine the virial velocity of gas in the broad\nline region, the monochromatic continuum luminosity at 3000 A, and the total\nHalpha line luminosity. With a sample of 43 AGNs spanning a range of two\ndecades in luminosity (i.e., L ~ 10^44-46 ergs/s), we find a tight correlation\nbetween the continuum and line luminosity with a distribution characterized by\n<log(L_3000/L_Halpha)> = 1.52 and a dispersion sigma = 0.16.

When the disc's\nmagnetic field is strong enough to prevent horseshoe motion, the corotation\ntorque is replaced by a torque arising from magnetic resonances. For weak\nenough magnetic fields, horseshoe motion and a corotation torque exist, and\nrecent turbulent MHD simulations have reported the existence of a new component\nof the corotation torque in the presence of a mean toroidal field. The aim of\nthis paper is to investigate the physical origin and the properties of this new\ncorotation torque. We performed MHD simulations of a low mass planet embedded\nin a 2D laminar disc threaded by a weak toroidal magnetic field, with the\neffects of turbulence modelled by a viscosity and a resistivity. We confirm\nthat the interaction between the magnetic field and the horseshoe motion\nresults in an additional corotation torque on the planet, which we dub the MHD\ntorque excess. It is caused by the accumulation of the magnetic field along the\ndownstream separatrices of the planet's horseshoe region, which gives rise to\nan azimuthally asymmetric underdense region at that location. The properties of\nthe MHD torque excess are characterised by varying the slope of the density,\ntemperature and magnetic field profiles, as well as the diffusion coefficients\nand the strength of the magnetic field. The sign of the MHD torque excess\ndepends on the density and temperature gradients only, and is positive for\nprofiles expected in protoplanetary discs. Its magnitude is in turn mainly\ndetermined by the strength of the magnetic field and the turbulent resistivity.\nThe MHD torque excess can be strong enough to reverse migration, even when the\nmagnetic pressure is less than one percent of the thermal pressure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Jan 2013 21:33:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-19"}

We study this system in a configuration where the superconductors\nare connected through gate-controllable quantum dots. Multipair phase-coherent\nresonances and phase-dependent multiple Andreev reflections are both obtained\nwhen the voltages of the lateral superconductors are commensurate, and they add\nto the usual local dissipative transport due to quasiparticles. The two-pair\nresonance (quartets) as well as some other higher order multipair resonances\nare {\\pi}-shifted at low voltage. Dot control can be used to dramatically\nenhance the multipair current when the voltages are resonant with the dot\nlevels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Jan 2013 21:55:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 Jun 2013 19:43:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-05"}

In some recent contributions the standard\nCahn-Hilliard equation has been replaced by its nonlocal version. The\ncorresponding system is physically more relevant and mathematically more\nchallenging. Indeed, the only known results are essentially the existence of a\nglobal weak solution and the existence of a suitable notion of global attractor\nfor the corresponding dynamical system defined without uniqueness. In fact,\neven in the two-dimensional case, uniqueness of weak solutions is still an open\nproblem. Here we take a step forward in the case of regular potentials. First\nwe prove the existence of a (unique) strong solution in two dimensions. Then we\nshow that any weak solution regularizes in finite time uniformly with respect\nto bounded sets of initial data. This result allows us to deduce that the\nglobal attractor is the union of all the bounded complete trajectories which\nare strong solutions. We also demonstrate that each trajectory converges to a\nsingle equilibrium, provided that the potential is real analytic and the\nexternal forces vanish.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Jan 2013 22:04:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-14"}

A long wave, low Reynolds number expansion is introduced to\nanalytically obtain the region of stability.

This stochastic\nwideband impulse modulated self-noise (SWIMS) limits pulsar timing precision by\nrandomly biasing the measured times of arrival and thus increasing the root\nmean square (rms) timing residual. We discuss an improved methodology of\nremoving this bias in the measured times of arrival by including information\nabout polarized radiation. Observations of J0437-4715 made over a one-week\ninterval at the Parkes Observatory are used to demonstrate a nearly 40 per cent\nimprovement in the rms timing residual with this extended analysis. In this\nway, based on the observations over a 64 MHz bandwidth centred at 1341 MHz with\nintegrations over 16.78 s we achieve a 476 ns rms timing residual. In the\nabsence of systematic error, these results lead to a predicted rms timing\nresidual of 30 ns in one hour integrations; however the data are currently\nlimited by variable Faraday rotation in the Earth's ionosphere. The improvement\ndemonstrated in this work provides an opportunity to increase the sensitivity\nin various pulsar timing experiments, for example pulsar timing arrays that\npursue the detection of the stochastic background of gravitational waves. The\nfractional improvement is highly dependent on the properties of the pulse\nprofile and the stochastic wideband impulse modulated self-noise of the pulsar\nin question.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Jan 2013 01:32:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-23"}

We\nfocus on the static (substrate, shape, curvature, strain and doping) and\ndynamic (starting point of functionalization, migration barriers and stability\nof configurations) aspects that provide a more correct and selective modeling\nof the chemisorption of various chemical species on the graphene scaffold.\nBased on the recent modeling of experimentally realized functionalization of\ndifferent types of graphene we can conclude that the formation of uniform one-\nor two-sided functionalized graphene discussed in earlier studies is an\nexception to the typical scenarios of graphene chemistry. The presence of\ndifferent substrates, defects and lattice distortions, such as ripples and\nstrain, results in the formation of clusters or lines from the functional\ngroups. Several configurations of the chemical species on the graphene\nsubstrate have been found to exist with ideal models but are only stable for\ngraphene functionalized under special conditions. The role of the technical\nparameters, such as the functionals and computational methods employed, and the\nimportant guidelines for the modeling of the chemical properties of various\ntypes of graphene are also discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Jan 2013 06:10:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-14"}

A quantum theory on protein folding is\nproposed. Compared with other dynamical variables such as mobile electrons,\nchemical bonds and stretching-bending vibrations the molecular torsion has the\nlowest energy and can be looked as the slow variable of the system.\nSimultaneously, from the multi-minima property of torsion potential the local\nconformational states are well defined. Following the idea that the slow\nvariables slave the fast ones and using the nonadiabaticity operator method we\ndeduce the Hamiltonian describing conformational change. It is proved that the\ninfluence of fast variables on the macromolecule can fully be taken into\naccount through a phase transformation of slow variable wave function. Starting\nfrom the conformation- transition Hamiltonian the nonradiative matrix element\nis calculated in two important cases: A, only electrons are fast variables and\nthe electronic state does not change in the transition process; B, fast\nvariables are not limited to electrons but the perturbation approximation can\nbe used. Then, the general formulas for protein folding rate are deduced. The\nanalytical form of the formula is utilized to study the temperature dependence\nof protein folding rate and the curious non-Arrhenius temperature relation is\ninterpreted. The decoherence time of quantum torsion state is estimated and the\nquantum coherence degree of torsional angles in the protein folding is studied\nby using temperature dependence data.

We use Bayesian methods to estimate the model, and we evaluate its\nadequacy by studying histograms of imputed values of the latent remembered\ncigarette count. Our analysis suggests that both mis-remembering and heaping\ncontribute substantially to the distortion of self-reported cigarette counts.\nHigher nicotine dependence, white ethnicity and male sex are associated with\ngreater remembered smoking given the EMA count. The model is potentially useful\nin other applications where it is desirable to understand the process by which\nsubjects remember and report true observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Jan 2013 09:26:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-14"}

The presence of the moat flow around sunspots is intimately linked\nto the mere existence of sunspots. Aims. We characterize the moat flow (MF) and\nEvershed flow (EF) in sunspots to enhance our knowledge of sunspot structures\nand photospheric flow properties. Methods. We calibrated HMI synoptic Doppler\nmaps and used them to analyze 3h time averages of 31 circular, stable, and\nfully developed sunspots at heliocentric angles of some 50$^{\\circ}$. Assuming\naxially symmetrical flow fields, we infer the azimuthally averaged horizontal\nvelocity component of the MF and EF from 51 velocity maps. We studied the MF\nproperties (velocity and extension) and elaborate on how these components\ndepend on sunspot parameters (sunspot size and EF velocity). To explore the\nweekly and monthly evolution of MFs, we compare spots rotating from the eastern\nto western limbs and spots that reappear on the eastern limb. Results. Our\ncalibration procedure of HMI Doppler maps yields reliable and consistent\nresults. In 3h averages, we find the MF decreases on average from some 1000\n$\\pm$ 200m/s just outside the spot boundary to 500m/s after an additional 4 Mm.\nThe average MF extension lies at 9.2 $\\pm$ 5 Mm, where the velocity drops below\nsome 180m/s. Neither the MF velocity nor its extension depend significantly on\nthe sunspot size or EF velocity. But, the EF velocity does show a tendency to\nbe enhanced with sunspot size. On a time scale of a week and a month, we find\ndecreasing MF extensions and a tendency for the MF velocity to increase for\nstrongly decaying sunspots, whereas the changing EF velocity has no impact on\nthe MF. Conclusions. On 3h averages, the EF velocity scales with the size of\nsunspots, while the MF properties show no significant correlation with the EF\nor with the sunspot size. This we interpret as a hint that the physical origins\nof EF and MF are distinct.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Jan 2013 09:49:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

The charging\nstation is equipped with renewable energy generation devices and can also buy\nenergy from power grid. The uncertainty of the EV arrival, the intermittence of\nthe renewable energy, and the variation of the grid power price are taken into\naccount and described as independent Markov processes. Meanwhile, the charging\nenergy for each EV is random. The goal is to minimize the mean waiting time of\nEVs under the long term constraint on the cost. We propose queue mapping to\nconvert the EV queue to the charge demand queue and prove the equivalence\nbetween the minimization of the two queues' average length. Then we focus on\nthe minimization for the average length of the charge demand queue under long\nterm cost constraint. We propose a framework of Markov decision process (MDP)\nto investigate this scheduling problem. The system state includes the charge\ndemand queue length, the charge demand arrival, the energy level in the storage\nbattery of the renewable energy, the renewable energy arrival, and the grid\npower price. Additionally the number of charging demands and the allocated\nenergy from the storage battery compose the two-dimensional policy. We derive\ntwo necessary conditions of the optimal policy. Moreover, we discuss the\nreduction of the two-dimensional policy to be the number of charging demands\nonly. We give the sets of system states for which charging no demand and\ncharging as many demands as possible are optimal, respectively. Finally we\ninvestigate the proposed radical policy and conservative policy numerically.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Jan 2013 11:28:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-14"}

This is often tackled using a database search: each observed spectrum\nis compared against a large number of theoretical \"expected\" spectra predicted\nfrom candidate peptide sequences in a database, and the best match is\nidentified using some heuristic scoring criterion.

This probabilistic model takes account of peak locations and\nintensities, in both observed and theoretical spectra, which enables\nincorporation of detailed knowledge of chemical plausibility in peptide\nidentification. Besides placing peptide scoring on a sounder theoretical\nfooting, the likelihood-based score also has important practical benefits: it\nprovides natural measures for assessing the uncertainty of each identification,\nand in comparisons on benchmark data it produced more accurate peptide\nidentifications than other methods, including SEQUEST. Although we focus here\non peptide identification, our scoring rule could easily be integrated into any\ndownstream analyses that require peptide-spectrum match scores.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Jan 2013 12:03:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-14"}

Yannakakis provides a quasi-polynomial\nCS-separator, i.e. of size $O(n^{\\log n})$, and addresses the problem of\nfinding a polynomial CS-separator. This question is still open even for perfect\ngraphs. We show that a polynomial CS-separator almost surely exists for random\ngraphs.

Many of the predictions of\nmodels of stellar rotation are now compared with observations of surface\nabundances and velocities, with interferometric studies of fast rotating stars,\nwith internal rotation profiles as they can be deduced by asteroseismology, to\ncite just a few observational constraints. In this paper, we investigate how\nthe outputs of models depend on the prescriptions used for the diffusion\ncoefficients included in the shellular rotating models. After recalling the\nvarious prescriptions found in the literature, we discuss their impacts on the\nevolutionary tracks and lifetimes of the Main-Sequence (MS) phase, the changes\nof the surface composition and velocities during the MS phase, the distribution\nof the core helium lifetime in the blue and the red part of the HR diagram, the\nextensions of the blue loops, the evolution of the angular momentum of the\ncore, and the synthesis of primary nitrogen in fast-rotating metal-poor massive\nstars. While some of these outputs depend only slightly on the prescriptions\nused (for instance, the evolution of the surface velocities), most of them show\na significant dependence. The models which best fit the changes of the surface\nabundances are those computed with the vertical shear diffusion coefficient of\nMaeder (1997) and the horizontal shear diffusion coefficient by Zahn (1992).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Jan 2013 13:04:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

Contrary to the apparent\nbehavior induced by some choices of coordinates, the metric we have obtained is\ncompletely regular everywhere and is free of singularities (except the\nwell-known Friedmann singularity at $t=0$).

Initial studies of MR-guidance in gynecologic\nbrachtherapy demonstrate the ability to optimize tumor coverage and reduce\nradiation dose to normal tissues, resulting in improved outcomes for patients.\nIn this article we describe a methodology to aid applicator placement and\ntreatment planning for 3 Tesla (3T) MR-guided brachytherapy that was developed\nspecifically for gynecologic cancers. This has been used in 18 cases to date in\nthe Advanced Multimodality Image Guided Operating suite at Brigham and Women's\nHospital.

An MR sequence using 3D-balanced steady state\nfree precession in a 3T MR scan was identified as the best sequence for\ncatheter identification with ballooning artifact at the tip. 3D treatment\nplanning was performed using MR images. Item in development include a software\nmodule designed to support virtual needle trajectory planning that includes\nprobabilistic bias correction, graph based segmentation, and image registration\nalgorithms.
