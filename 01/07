It is increasingly routine to isolate\nbehavioural mutants, clone and characterise mutant genes, and discern the\nmolecular and neural basis for a behavioural phenotype. Conversely, reverse\ngenetic approaches have made it possible to straightforwardly identify genes of\ninterest in whole-genome sequences and generate mutants that can be subjected\nto phenotypic analysis. In this latter approach, it is the phenotyping that\npresents the major bottleneck; when it comes to connecting phenotype to\ngenotype in freely behaving animals, analysis of behaviour itself remains\nsuperficial and time consuming. However, many proof-of-principle studies of\nautomated behavioural analysis over the last decade have poised the field on\nthe verge of exciting developments that promise to begin closing this gap.\n  In the broadest sense, our goal in this chapter is to explore what we can\nlearn about the genes involved in neural function by carefully observing\nbehaviour. This approach is rooted in model organism genetics but shares ideas\nwith ethology and neuroscience, as well as computer vision and bioinformatics.\nAfter introducing C. elegans as a model, we will survey the research that has\nled to the current state of the art in worm behavioural phenotyping and present\ncurrent research that is transforming our approach to behavioural genetics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Jan 2013 16:01:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-08"}

The\ndeparture from the F - T^4 relation during the cooling phase of the X-ray\nbursts in 4U 1820-30 could be due to changes in the emitting area of the\nneutron star while the atmosphere cools-down, variations in the\ncolour-correction factor due to chemical evolution, or the presence of a source\nof heat, e.g. residual hydrogen nuclear burning, playing an important role when\nthe burst emission ceases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Jan 2013 18:26:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-24"}

This paper presents the first numerical simulations to resolve\nthe star formation process on sub-parsec scales, whilst also following the\ndynamics of the interstellar medium (ISM) on galactic scales. In these models,\nthe warm low density ISM gas flows into the spiral arms where orbit crowding\nproduces the shock formation of dense clouds, held together temporarily by\ntheir external pressure. Cooling allows the gas to be compressed to\nsufficiently high densities that local regions collapse under their own gravity\nand form stars. The star formation rates follow a Schmidt-Kennicutt\n\\Sigma_{SFR} ~ \\Sigma_{gas}^{1.4} type relation with the local surface density\nof gas while following a linear relation with the cold and dense gas. Cooling\nis the primary driver of star formation and the star formation rates as it\ndetermines the amount of cold gas available for gravitational collapse. The\nstar formation rates found in the simulations are offset to higher values\nrelative to the extragalactic values, implying a constant reduction, such as\nfrom feedback or magnetic fields, is likely to be required. Intriguingly, it\nappears that a spiral or other convergent shock and the accompanying thermal\ninstability can explain how star formation is triggered, generate the physical\nconditions of molecular clouds and explain why star formation rates are tightly\ncorrelated to the gas properties of galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Jan 2013 19:26:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

It has been used in traditional\nhigh performance computing and grid computing environments. For MapReduce\nenvironments, existing methods to compute the QR decomposition use a\nnumerically unstable approach that relies on indirectly computing the Q factor.\nIn the best case, these methods require only two passes over the data. In this\npaper, we describe how to compute a stable tall-and-skinny QR factorization on\na MapReduce architecture in only slightly more than 2 passes over the data. We\ncan compute the SVD with only a small change and no difference in performance.\nWe present a performance comparison between our new direct TSQR method, a\nstandard unstable implementation for MapReduce (Cholesky QR), and the classic\nstable algorithm implemented for MapReduce (Householder QR).

This is formed by the combination of the Gompertz curve, representing\nthe overwhelming majority of the population (~99%), with the Pareto power law,\nrepresenting the tiny richest part (~1%). In line with Goodwin's original\nmodel, we identify the Gompertzian part with the workers and the Paretian\ncomponent with the class of capitalists. Since the GPD parameters are obtained\nfor each year and the Goodwin macroeconomics is a time evolving model, we use\npreviously determined, and further extended here, Brazilian GPD parameters, as\nwell as unemployment data, to study the time evolution of these quantities in\nBrazil from 1981 to 2009 by means of the Goodwin dynamics. This is done in the\noriginal Goodwin model and an extension advanced by Desai et al. (2006). As far\nas Brazilian data is concerned, our results show partial qualitative and\nquantitative agreement with both models in the studied time period, although\nthe original one provides better data fit. Nevertheless, both models fall short\nof a good empirical agreement as they predict single center cycles which were\nnot found in the data. We discuss the specific points where the Goodwin\ndynamics must be improved in order to provide a more realistic representation\nof the dynamics of economic systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Jan 2013 01:39:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 Jan 2013 18:40:10 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 30 Jan 2013 04:48:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-12"}

Due to the spin mixing of conduction and valence bands, the\nelectric field not only accelerates electrons in each band, but also leads to\ninter-band precession. In the presence of the electric field, electrons can\ntransfer from the valence band to the conduction one via the inter-band\nprecession and inter-band electron-phonon scattering. The electron density in\neach band varies with the electric field linearly when the electric field is\nstrong. Due to the spin-momentum locking, a transverse spin polarization, with\nthe magnitude proportional to the momentum scattering time, is induced by the\nelectric field. The induced spin polarization depends on the electric field\nlinearly when the latter is small. Moreover, its magnitude is inversely\nproportional to the temperature and is insensitive to the electron density at\nhigh temperature. Our investigation also reveals that due to the large relative\nstatic dielectric constant, the Coulomb scattering is too weak to establish a\ndrifted Fermi distribution with a unified hot-electron temperature in the\nsteady state under the electric field. After turning off the electric field in\nthe steady state, the hot carriers cool down in a time scale of energy\nrelaxation which is very long (of the order of 100-1000 ps) while the spin\npolarization relaxes in a time scale of momentum scattering which is quite\nshort (of the order of 0.01-0.1 ps).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Jan 2013 01:54:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-28"}

This hyperaccretion disk is optically thin to\nneutrinos in the radial direction, therefore the neutrinos produced at one\nradius can travel for a long distance in the disk. Those neutrinos can thus be\nabsorbed with certain probability by the disk matter at the other radius and\nheat the disk there. The effect of this \"global neutrino heating\" has been\nignored in previous works and is the focus of this paper. We find that around\nthe \"ignition\" radius r_{ign}, the global neutrino heating rate could be\ncomparable to or even larger than the local viscous heating rate thus must be\nan important process. Two possible consequences are in order if the \"global\nneutrino heating\" is taken into account: i) the temperature of the disk is\nslightly raised and the \"ignition\" radius r_{ign} slightly shifts to a larger\nradius, both lead to the increasing of the total neutrino flux; ii) what is\nmore interesting is that, the temperature of the ADAF just beyond r_{ign} may\nbe raised above the virial temperature thus the accretion will be suppressed.\nIn this case, the activity of the black hole is expected to oscillate between\nan active and inactive phases. The timescale of the active phases is estimated\nto be \\sim 1 second. If the timescale of the inactive phase is comparable to or\nless than this value, this intermittent activity may explain the slow\nvariability component of the GRBs.

In order to predict the dynamics, we utilize the numerical exact\ndiagonalization method and also reproduce the calculation in the HF\napproximation for comparison. The toroidal gases originally have a rotational\nsymmetry in the toroidal direction. We firstly prepare a deformed ground state\nas an initial state by adding a weak potential deformed in the toroidal\ndirection, and then remove the potential to start the dynamics. In the\ndynamics, number densities of the deformed gases exhibit oscillations as\ndemonstrated in the present paper. As a result, we find out that the bosons and\nfermions show quite different behaviors owing to quantum statistics. In\nparticular, the bosons exhibit a low-frequency oscillation in the strong\nboson-boson attraction regime owing to the many-body correlations, and it can\nnot be reproduced in the HF approximation. The oscillation of the fermions is\nstrongly influenced by that of the bosons through the boson-fermion interaction\nas a forced oscillator. In addition, we also discuss a relationship between the\nlow-frequency oscillation and restoration of the broken symmetry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Jan 2013 10:25:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-08"}

We expand on previous analysis of\nthe Jeans mass inside spiral structures in self-gravitating discs,\nincorporating the effects of stellar irradiation and background irradiation. If\nirradiation is present, fragmentation is suppressed for marginally unstable\ndiscs at low accretion rates (compared to the no-irradiation case), but these\nlower accretion rates correspond to higher mass discs. Fragmentation can still\noccur for high accretion rates, but is consequently suppressed at lower disc\nsurface densities, and the subsequent Jeans mass is boosted. These results\nfurther bolster the consensus that, without subsequent fragment disruption or\nmass loss, the gravitational instability is more likely to form brown dwarfs\nand low-mass stars than gas giant planets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Jan 2013 10:52:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

Specifically,\nwe show that for a chain of d-dimensional spins, governed by a 1D local\nHamiltonian with a spectral gap \\eps>0, the entanglement entropy of the ground\nstate with respect to any cut in the chain is upper bounded by $O{\\frac{\\log^3\nd}{\\eps}}$. Our approach uses the framework Arad et al to construct a\nChebyshev-based AGSP (Approximate Ground Space Projection) with favorable\nfactors. However, our construction uses the Hamiltonian directly, instead of\nusing the Detectability lemma, which allows us to work with general\n(frustrated) Hamiltonians, as well as slightly improving the $1/\\eps$\ndependence of the bound in Arad et al. To achieve that, we establish a new,\n\"random-walk like\", bound on the entanglement rank of an arbitrary power of a\n1D Hamiltonian, which might be of independent interest: \\ER{H^\\ell} \\le (\\ell\nd)^{O(\\sqrt{\\ell})}. Finally, treating d as a constant, our AGSP shows that the\nground state is well approximated by a matrix product state with a sublinear\nbond dimension $B=e^{O(\\log^{3/4}n/\\eps^{1/4})}.

The Herschel maps are used to derive\ntemperature and column density maps of G48 using a model based on a modified\nblackbody. We find that G48 has a relatively simple structure and is relatively\nisolated; thus this IRDC provides an excellent target to study the collapse and\nfragmentation of a filamentary structure in the absence of complicating factors\nsuch as strong external feedback. The derived temperature structure of G48 is\nclearly non-isothermal from cloud to core scale. The column density peaks are\nspatially coincident with the lowest temperatures (~ 17.5 K) in G48. A total\ncloud mass of ~390Msun is derived from the column density maps. By comparing\nthe luminosity-to-mass ratio of 13 point sources detected in the Herschel/PACS\nbands to evolutionary models, we find that two cores are likely to evolve into\nhigh-mass stars (M>8 Msun). The derived mean projected separation of point\nsources is smaller than in other IRDCs but in good agreement with theoretical\npredications for cylindrical collapse. We detect several molecular species such\nas CO, HCO+, HCN, HNC and N2H+. CO is depleted by a factor of ~3.5 compared to\nthe expected interstellar abundance, from which we conclude that CO freezes out\nin the central region. Furthermore, the molecular clumps, associated with the\nsub-millimeter peaks in G48, appear to be gravitationally unbound or just\npressure confined. The analysis of critical line masses in G48 show that the\nentire filament is collapsing, overcoming any internal support.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Jan 2013 11:58:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

Specifically, in\nmany applications $\\mathcal{D}$ is a collection of samples obtained from an\nunknown probability distribution $\\pi$ on transactions, and by extracting the\nFIs in $\\mathcal{D}$ one attempts to infer itemsets that are frequently (i.e.,\nwith probability at least $\\theta$) generated by $\\pi$, which we call the True\nFrequent Itemsets (TFIs). Due to the inherently stochastic nature of the\ngenerative process, the set of FIs is only a rough approximation of the set of\nTFIs, as it often contains a huge number of \\emph{false positives}, i.e.,\nspurious itemsets that are not among the TFIs. In this work we design and\nanalyze an algorithm to identify a threshold $\\hat{\\theta}$ such that the\ncollection of itemsets with frequency at least $\\hat{\\theta}$ in $\\mathcal{D}$\ncontains only TFIs with probability at least $1-\\delta$, for some\nuser-specified $\\delta$. Our method uses results from statistical learning\ntheory involving the (empirical) VC-dimension of the problem at hand. This\nallows us to identify almost all the TFIs without including any false positive.\nWe also experimentally compare our method with the direct mining of\n$\\mathcal{D}$ at frequency $\\theta$ and with techniques based on widely-used\nstandard bounds (i.e., the Chernoff bounds) of the binomial distribution, and\nshow that our algorithm outperforms these methods and achieves even better\nresults than what is guaranteed by the theoretical analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Jan 2013 15:04:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Apr 2013 12:54:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 22 Jan 2014 16:38:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-23"}

In both cases, we find the\nfinite holographic energy-momentum and spin currents and obtain the associated\n(anomalous) Noether--Ward identities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Jan 2013 15:51:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 May 2013 15:10:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

Studies of molecules that\nare intrinsically chiral, such as double-stranded DNA, is one example. Their\nproperties generally depend on the local geometry, i.e. on curvature and\ntorsion, yet the paths of closed molecules are globally restricted by topology.\nMolecules that fulfill a twist neutrality condition, a zero sum rule for the\nincremental change in the rate of winding along the curve, will behave\nneutrally to strain. This has implications for plasmids. For small circular\nmicroDNAs it follows that there must exist a minimum length for these to be\ndouble-stranded. It also follows that all microDNAs longer than the minimum\nlength must be concave. This counterintuitive result is consistent with the\nkink-like appearance which has been observed for circular DNA. A prediction for\nthe total negative curvature of a circular microDNA is given as a function of\nits length.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Jan 2013 17:21:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 Jan 2013 12:59:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 14 Feb 2013 21:43:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-27"}

The simplest example is the problem of reconstruction of linear\ncombination of $\\delta$-functions of the form\n$g(x)=\\sum_{i=1}^{n}a_{i}\\delta(x-x_{i})$, with the unknown parameters $a_{i},\\\nx_{i},\\ i=1,...,n,$ from the \"moment measurements\" $m_{k}=\\int x^{k}g(x)dx.$\n  Global solution of the Prony system, i.e. inversion of the Prony mapping,\nencounters several types of singularities.
