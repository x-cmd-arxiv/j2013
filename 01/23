For discrete relaxation\ndistributions, such models correspond with causal wave equations of\ninteger-order temporal derivatives. It has also been shown that certain\ncontinuous distributions may give causal wave equations with fractional-order\ntemporal derivatives. This paper demonstrates analytically that if the\nwave-frequency {\\omega} satisfies \\Omega_L << {\\omega} << \\Omega_H, a\ncontinuous relaxation distribution populating only {\\Omega} belongs to\n[\\Omega_L,\\Omega_H] gives the same effective wave equation as for a fully\npopulated distribution. This insight sparks the main contribution: the\nelaboration of a method to determine discrete relaxation parameters intended\nfor mimicking a desired attenuation behavior for band-limited waves. In\nparticular, power-law attenuation is discussed as motivated by its prevalence\nin complex media, e.g. biological tissue. A Mittag-Leffler function related\ndistribution of relaxation mechanisms has previously been shown to be related\nto the fractional Zener wave equation of three power-law attenuation regimes.\nBecause these regimes correspond to power-law regimes in the relaxation\ndistribution, the idea is to sample the distribution's compressibility\ncontributions evenly in logarithmic frequency while appropriately taking the\nstepsize into account. This work thence claims to provide a model-based\napproach to determination of discrete relaxation parameters intended to\nadequately model attenuation power-laws.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Jan 2013 17:59:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-27"}

It represents a\ngeneralization of the $L_p$-Brunn-Minkowski theory, analogous to the way that\nOrlicz spaces generalize $L_p$ spaces. For appropriate convex functions\n$\\varphi:[0,\\infty)^m\\to [0,\\infty)$, a new way of combining arbitrary sets in\n$\\R^n$ is introduced. This operation, called Orlicz addition and denoted by\n$+_{\\varphi}$, has several desirable properties, but is not associative unless\nit reduces to $L_p$ addition. A general framework is introduced for the\nOrlicz-Brunn-Minkowski theory that includes both the new addition and\npreviously introduced concepts, and makes clear for the first time the relation\nto Orlicz spaces and norms. It is also shown that Orlicz addition is intimately\nrelated to a natural and fundamental generalization of Minkowski addition\ncalled $M$-addition. The results obtained show, roughly speaking, that the\nOrlicz-Brunn-Minkowski theory is the most general possible based on an addition\nthat retains all the basic geometrical properties enjoyed by the\n$L_p$-Brunn-Minkowski theory.\n  Inequalities of the Brunn-Minkowski type are obtained, both for $M$-addition\nand Orlicz addition. The new Orlicz-Brunn-Minkowski inequality implies the\n$L_p$-Brunn-Minkowski inequality. New Orlicz-Minkowski inequalities are\nobtained that generalize the $L_p$-Minkowski inequality. One of these has\nconnections with the conjectured log-Brunn-Minkowski inequality of Lutwak,\nYang, and Zhang, and in fact these two inequalities together are shown to split\nthe classical Brunn-Minkowski inequality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Jan 2013 18:38:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-23"}

We have determined the\nphysical properties of all these objects and their He, N, O, Ne, S and Ar\nabundances in a consistent way.\n  We find that, globally, compact HII regions have abundance ratios similar to\nthose of giant HII regions, while PNe have systematically larger N/O ratios and\nsimilar Ne/O and Ar/O ratios. We demonstrate that the nitrogen enhancement in\nPNe cannot be only due to second dredge-up in the progenitor stars, since their\ninitial masses are around 2--2.5\\,\\msun. An extra mixing process is required,\nperhaps driven by stellar rotation.\n  Concerning the radial abundance distribution, PNe behave differently from HII\nregions: in the central part of the galaxy their average O/H abundance ratio is\n0.15 dex smaller. Their abundance dispersion at any galactocentric radius is\nsignificantly larger than that shown by HII regions and many of them have O/H\nvalues higher than HII regions at the same galactocentric distance. This\nsuggests that not only nitrogen, but also oxygen is affected by nucleosynthesis\nin the PN progenitors, by an amount which depends at least on the stellar\nrotation velocity and possibly other parameters. The formal O/H, Ne/H and Ar/He\nabundance gradients from PNe are significantly shallower that from HII regions.\nWe argue that this indicates a steepening of the metallicity gradient in NGC\n300 during the last Gyr, rather than an effect of radial stellar motions,\nalthough the large observed dispersion makes this conclusion only tentative.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Jan 2013 19:08:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

We find that the emission from\nwater has a different spatial and velocity distribution from that of the J=1-0\nand 2-1 transitions of CO, but it has a similar spatial distribution to H2, and\nits intensity follows the H2 intensity derived from IRAC images. This suggests\nthat water traces the outflow gas at hundreds of kelvins responsible for the H2\nemission, and not the component at tens of kelvins typical of low-J CO\nemission. A warm origin of the water emission is confirmed by a remarkable\ncorrelation between the intensities of the 557 and 1670 GHz lines, which also\nindicates the emitting gas has a narrow range of excitations.

By means of multi-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations, we\ninvestigate the acceleration performance of weakly magnetized relativistic\nshocks, in the magnetization range 0<sigma<1e-1. The pre-shock magnetic field\nis orthogonal to the flow, as generically expected for relativistic shocks. We\nfind that relativistic perpendicular shocks propagating in electron-positron\nplasmas are efficient particle accelerators if the magnetization is sigma<1e-3.\nFor electron-ion plasmas, the transition to efficient acceleration occurs for\nsigma<3e-5. Here, the acceleration process proceeds similarly for the two\nspecies, since the electrons enter the shock nearly in equipartition with the\nions, as a result of strong pre-heating in the self-generated upstream\nturbulence. In both electron-positron and electron-ion shocks, we find that the\nmaximum energy of the accelerated particles scales in time as t^(1/2). This\nscaling is shallower than the so-called (and commonly assumed) Bohm limit, and\nit naturally results from the small-scale nature of the Weibel turbulence\ngenerated in the shock layer. In magnetized plasmas, the energy of the\naccelerated particles increases until it reaches a saturation value that scales\nwith the magnetization as sigma^(-1/4). Further energization is prevented by\nthe fact that the self-generated turbulence is confined within a finite region\nof thickness proportional to sigma^(-1/2) around the shock.

The IR luminosities (LIR) of galaxies in the pair and (mass, z and\nenvironment-matched) control samples are determined from the SDSS -- IRAS\nmatched catalog of Hwang et al. (2010). We find a trend for increasing LIRG\nfraction towards smaller pair separations, peaking at a factor of ~ 5--10 above\nthe median control fraction at the smallest separations (rp < 20 kpc), but\nremaining elevated by a factor ~ 2--3 even out to 80 kpc (the widest\nseparations in our sample). We also find that LIRGs are most likely to be found\nin high mass galaxies which have an approximately equal mass companion. We\nconfirm the results of previous studies that both the active galactic nucleus\n(AGN) fraction and merger fraction increase strongly as a function of IR\nluminosity. About 7% of LIRGs are associated with major mergers, as defined\nwithin the criteria and mass completion of our sample. Finally, we quantify a\nSFR offset (Delta SFR) as the enhancement (or decrement) relative to\nstar-forming galaxies of the same mass and redshift. We demonstrate that there\nis a clear connection between the Delta SFR and the classification of a galaxy\nas a LIRG that is mass dependent. Most of the LIRGs in our merger sample are\nrelatively high mass galaxies (log M* > 10.5), likely because the SFR\nenhancement required to produce LIRG luminosities is more modest than at low\nmasses. The Delta SFR offers a redshift-independent metric for the\nidentification of the galaxies with the most enhanced star forming rates that\ndoes not rely on fixed LIR boundaries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Jan 2013 22:04:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

Depending on the application, automatic or interactive methods\nare desired; however, regardless of the application type, efficient computation\nof video object segmentation is crucial for time-critical applications;\nspecifically, mobile and interactive applications require near real-time\nefficiencies. In this paper, we address the problem of video segmentation from\nthe perspective of efficiency. We initially redefine the problem of video\nobject segmentation as the propagation of MRF energies along the temporal\ndomain. For this purpose, a novel and efficient method is proposed to propagate\nMRF energies throughout the frames via bilateral filters without using any\nglobal texture, color or shape model. Recently presented bi-exponential filter\nis utilized for efficiency, whereas a novel technique is also developed to\ndynamically solve graph-cuts for varying, non-lattice graphs in general linear\nfiltering scenario. These improvements are experimented for both automatic and\ninteractive video segmentation scenarios. Moreover, in addition to the\nefficiency, segmentation quality is also tested both quantitatively and\nqualitatively. Indeed, for some challenging examples, significant time\nefficiency is observed without loss of segmentation quality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Jan 2013 22:26:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Apr 2013 17:55:33 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 27 Oct 2014 03:29:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-28"}

Third, put the\npredictors of phenotype and fitness into an exact equation for evolutionary\nchange, providing a complete expression of selection and other evolutionary\nprocesses. The complete expression separates the distinct causal roles of the\nvarious hypothesized components of phenotypes and fitness.

In the era of\nprecision cosmology, the presence of inhomogeneities may induce systematic\nerrors if not properly accounted. In this vein, a new interpretation of the\nconventional Dyer-Roeder (DR) approach by allowing light received from distant\nsources to travel in regions denser than average is proposed. It is argued that\nthe existence of a distribution of small and moderate cosmic voids (or \"black\nregions\") implies that its matter content was redistributed to the homogeneous\nand clustered matter components with the former becoming denser than the cosmic\naverage in the absence of voids. Phenomenologically, this means that the DR\nsmoothness parameter (denoted here by $\\alpha_E$) can be greater than unity,\nand, therefore, all previous analyses constraining it should be rediscussed\nwith a free upper limit. Accordingly, by performing a statistical analysis\ninvolving 557 type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) from Union2 compilation data in a\nflat $\\Lambda$CDM model we obtain for the extended parameter,\n$\\alpha_E=1.26^{+0.68}_{-0.54}$ ($1\\sigma$). The effects of $\\alpha_E$ are also\nanalyzed for generic $\\Lambda$CDM models and flat XCDM cosmologies. For both\nmodels, we find that a value of $\\alpha_E$ greater than unity is able to\nharmonize SNe Ia and cosmic microwave background observations thereby\nalleviating the well-known tension between low and high redshift data. Finally,\na simple toy model based on the existence of cosmic voids is proposed in order\nto justify why $\\alpha_E$ can be greater than unity as required by supernovae\ndata.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Jan 2013 23:07:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Mar 2014 19:30:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-11"}

Different\neffective interactions and novel correlated quantum many-body phases may be\nengineered in these systems, with the different phases being tunable via\nexternal parameters. In this article we investigate a two-species Fermi atom\nmixture: one species of atom exists in two hyperfine states and is confined to\nmove in a two-leg ladder, interacting with an on-site interaction, and the\nother moves freely in a two dimensional square lattice that contains the\ntwo-leg ladder. The two species of atoms interact via an on-site interaction on\nthe ladder. In the limit of weak inter-species interactions, the\ntwo-dimensional gas can be integrated out, leading to an effective long-range\nmediated interaction in the ladder, generated by to the on-site inter-species\ninteraction. We show that the form of the mediated interaction can be\ncontrolled by the density of the two-dimensional gas and that it enhances the\ncharge density wave instability in the two-leg ladder after the renormalization\ngroup transformation.

With increasing the temperature $T$, at\nfirst the quantum correlations in the system increase, smoothly reach the\nmaximum, and then turn again into zero according to the asymptotic law\n$T^{-2}$. It is also shown that in absence of external magnetic field $B$, the\nclassical correlation $C$ at $T\\to0$ is, vice versa, maximal. Our calculations\npredict that in crystalline gypsum ${\\rm CaSO_4\\cdot2H_2O}$ the value of\nnatural (B=0) quantum discord between nuclear spins of hydrogen atoms is\nmaximal at the temperature of 0.644 $\\mu$K, and for 1,2-dichloroethane ${\\rm\nH_2ClC-CH_2Cl}$ the discord achieves the largest value at $T=0.517 \\mu$K. In\nboth cases, the discord equals $Q\\approx0.083$ bit/dimer what is 8.3% of its\nupper limit in two-qubit systems. We estimate also that for gypsum at room\ntemperature $Q\\sim10^{-18}$ bit/dimer, and for 1,2-dichloroethane at T=90 K the\ndiscord is $Q\\sim10^{-17}$ bit per a dimer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Jan 2013 03:39:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-24"}

More importantly, it remains largely unclear how to best assess the\nquality of assembled genome sequences. The Assemblathon competitions are\nintended to assess current state-of-the-art methods in genome assembly. Results\n- In Assemblathon 2, we provided a variety of sequence data to be assembled for\nthree vertebrate species (a bird, a fish, and snake). This resulted in a total\nof 43 submitted assemblies from 21 participating teams. We evaluated these\nassemblies using a combination of optical map data, Fosmid sequences, and\nseveral statistical methods. From over 100 different metrics, we chose ten key\nmeasures by which to assess the overall quality of the assemblies. Conclusions\n- Many current genome assemblers produced useful assemblies, containing a\nsignificant representation of their genes, regulatory sequences, and overall\ngenome structure. However, the high degree of variability between the entries\nsuggests that there is still much room for improvement in the field of genome\nassembly and that approaches which work well in assembling the genome of one\nspecies may not necessarily work well for another.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Jan 2013 06:16:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 20 Jun 2013 01:00:42 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 27 Jun 2013 16:00:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-02"}

This is due to the fact that the energy transfer between a transport\nelectron and a conducting terminal is determined by the site most strongly\ncoupled to that terminal. One-dimensional systems with both nearest-neighbor\nand variable-range transport as well as certain types of two-dimensional\nsystems, are considered. For a given sample, the changes in the thermopowers\ndue to modifying the bulk are quite limited, compared with those of the\nconductance. When the small thermopower changes exist, their average over a\nlarge ensemble of mesoscopic samples will vanish. We also obtain the\ndistribution of the thermopower in such an ensemble and show that its width\napproaches a finite limit with increasing sample length. This contrasts with\nthe distribution of conductances in such systems, whose width vanishes in the\nlong sample limit. Finally, we find that the thermal conductances in the\nthree-terminal case have a boundary-dominated contribution, due to\nnon-percolating conduction paths. This contribution can become dominant when\nthe usual conductance is small enough. All our theoretical statements are\nbacked by numerical computations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Jan 2013 06:30:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-22"}

The aim is to obtain YSO\nlists as complete as possible for studying the statistical properties, such as\nStar Formation Rate (SFR) and lifetimes of YSOs in different evolutionary\nstages. The largest obstacle for identifying YSOs comes from background\ngalaxies with similar SEDs to YSOs. Traditionally, selected color-color and\ncolor-magnitude criteria are used to separate YSOs and galaxies. However, since\nthere is no obvious boundary between YSOs and galaxies in Color-Color Diagrams\n(CCDs) and Color-Magnitude Diagrams (CMDs), those criteria may exclude faint\nYSOs near the boundary. In this paper, we separate the YSOs and galaxies in\nmulti-dimensional (Multi-D) magnitude space, which is equivalent to using all\nvariations of CMDs simultaneously. Comparing sources from molecular clouds to\nSpitzer's SWIRE data, which have negligible amount of YSOs, we can naturally\nidentify YSO candidates locating outside of the galaxy populated regions in the\nMulti-D space.

Stellar\nmass loss alone is unlikely to be rapid and high enough to eject planets at\ntypically-observed separations. However, the combination of mass loss and\nplanet-planet interactions can prompt a shift from stable to chaotic regions of\nphase space. Consequently, when mass loss ceases, the unstable configuration\nmay cause escape. By assuming a constant stellar mass loss rate, we utilize\nmaps of dynamical stability to illustrate the distribution of regular and\nchaotic trajectories in phase space. We show that chaos can drive the planets\nto undergo close encounters, leading to the ejection of one planet. Stellar\nmass loss can trigger the transition of a planetary system from a stable to\nchaotic configuration, subsequently causing escape.

Recently, a spread spectrum\ncompressed sensing MRI method modulates an image with a quadratic phase. It\nperforms better than the conventional compressed sensing MRI with variable\ndensity sampling, since the coherence between the sensing and sparsity bases\nare reduced. However, spread spectrum in that method is implemented via a shim\ncoil which limits its modulation intensity and is not convenient to operate. In\nthis letter, we propose to apply chirp (linear frequency-swept) radio frequency\npulses to easily control the spread spectrum. To accelerate the image\nreconstruction, an alternating direction algorithm is modified by exploiting\nthe complex orthogonality of the quadratic phase encoding. Reconstruction on\nthe acquired data demonstrates that more image features are preserved using the\nproposed approach than those of conventional CS-MRI.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Jan 2013 09:59:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-27"}

This combination indicates that luminescence degradation\nprocesses by both dynamic and static quenching, the latter mechanism being\npredominant. Under such high density excitation, the scintillation\ndeterioration of BC-400 is significantly enhanced compared to that observed in\nprevious investigations, mainly performed using light ions. The observed\nnon-linear behaviour implies that the dose at which luminescence starts\ndeteriorating is not independent on particles' stopping power, thus\nillustrating that the radiation hardness of plastic scintillators can be\nstrongly weakened under high excitation density in heavy ion environments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Jan 2013 10:15:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

High resolution spectra obtained by the XMM-Newton RGS detector\nreveal that the wind consists of three distinct ionization components, all\noutflowing at a velocity of 5000 km/s.

This leads to\nthe notion of smoothly local properties.\n  In realising the definition of a local property at a particular point it may\nbe that there are choices that need to be made. To say that the local property\nis smoothly local is to say that those choices can be made smoothly dependent\non the point. In particular, that a manifold has charts is a local property. A\nlocal addition is the structure needed to say that there is a way to choose a\nchart about each point so that it varies smoothly with that point.\n  To be able to extend these ideas beyond that of the local additivity of\nmanifolds we work in a category of generalised smooth spaces. We are thus are\nable to consider more general mapping spaces than just those arising from the\nmaps from one smooth manifold to another and thus able to generalise the\nstandard result on when this space of maps is again a smooth manifold.\n  As applications of this generalisation we show that the mapping spaces\ninvolving the various figure 8s from String Topology are manifolds, and that\nthey embed as submanifolds with tubular neighbourhoods in the corresponding\nloop spaces.

This implies corrections to the SM quark couplings to W, Z and\nHiggs so that FCNC processes receive contributions from tree level Z and Higgs\nexchanges and W bosons couple to right-handed quarks. In a particular version\nof this model in which the Yukawa matrix lambda^D in the heavy down fermion\nsector is unitary, lambda^U =1 and M = M_{VF} is fixed, only three real and\npositive definite parameters describe New Physics (NP) contributions to all\nDelta F=2 and Delta F=1 observables in K and B_{s,d} systems once the known\nquark masses and the CKM matrix are correctly reproduced.

This requires a repumper laser to\nmaintain the ion in the Doppler cooling cycle. Typically the 2D3/2 state, or\nsome of its hyperfine components if the ion has nuclear spin, has a higher\nmultiplicity than the upper state of the repumping transition. This can lead to\ndark states, which have to be destabilized by an external magnetic field or by\nmodulating the polarization of the repumper laser. We propose using\nunpolarized, incoherent amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) to drive the\nrepumping transition. An ASE source offers several advantages compared to a\nlaser. It prevents the buildup of dark states without external polarization\nmodulation even in zero magnetic field, it can drive multiple hyperfine\ntransitions simultaneously, and it requires no frequency stabilization. These\nfeatures make it very compact and robust, which is essential for the\ndevelopment of practical, transportable optical ion clocks. We construct a\ntheoretical model for the ASE radiation, including the possibility of the\nsource being partially polarized. Using 88Sr+ as an example, the performance of\nthe ASE source compared to a single-mode laser is analyzed by numerically\nsolving the eight-level density matrix equations for the involved energy\nlevels. Finally a reduced three-level system is derived, yielding a simple\nformula for the excited state population and scattering rate, which can be used\nto optimize the experimental parameters. The required ASE power spectral\ndensity can be obtained with current technology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Jan 2013 13:58:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 1 Feb 2013 13:02:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-04"}

The\nhistory of play with opponents is used to improve BPPs understanding OF their\nbehaviour.We compare BPP experimentally WITH : a simple RULE - based system; a\nprogram which depends exclusively ON hand probabilities(i.e., without opponent\nmodeling); AND WITH human players.BPP has shown itself TO be an effective\nplayer against ALL these opponents, barring the better humans.We also sketch\nout SOME likely ways OF improving play.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Jan 2013 15:59:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-30"}

Linguistic interpretation of such outputs often involves the use\nof linguistic approximation that assigns a linguistic label to a fuzzy set\nbased on the predefined primary terms, linguistic modifiers and linguistic\nconnectives. More generally, linguistic approximation can be formalized in the\nterms of the re-translation rules that correspond to the translation rules in\nex-plicitation (e.g. simple, modifier, composite, quantification and\nqualification rules) in com-puting with words [Zadeh 1996]. However most\nexisting methods of linguistic approximation use the simple, modifier and\ncomposite re-translation rules only. Although these methods can provide a\nsufficient approximation of simple fuzzy sets the approximation of more complex\nones that are typical in many practical applications of fuzzy systems may be\nless satisfactory. Therefore the question arises why not use in linguistic\nap-proximation also other re-translation rules corre-sponding to the\ntranslation rules in explicitation to advantage. In particular linguistic\nquantifica-tion may be desirable in situations where the conclusions\ninterpreted as quantified linguistic propositions can be more informative and\nnatu-ral. This paper presents some aspects of linguis-tic approximation in the\ncontext of the re-translation rules and proposes an approach to linguistic\napproximation with the use of quantifi-cation rules, i.e. quantified linguistic\napproxima-tion. Two methods of the quantified linguistic approximation are\nconsidered with the use of lin-guistic quantifiers based on the concepts of the\nnon-fuzzy and fuzzy cardinalities of fuzzy sets. A number of examples are\nprovided to illustrate the proposed approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Jan 2013 15:59:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-30"}
