We also use\nstate-of-the-art stellar evolution models to constrain the evolutionary status\nof Beta Ceti. We derive a mass of 3.5 M_sun and propose that this star is\nalready in the central-helium burning phase. Taking into account all our\nresults and the evolutionary status of the star, we suggest that dynamo action\nalone may not be eficient enough to account for the high magnetic activity of\nBeta Ceti. As an alternate option, we propose that it may be an Ap star\ndescendant presently undergoing central helium-burning and still exhibiting a\nremnant of the Ap star magnetic field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Jan 2013 17:01:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Jan 2013 10:12:03 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 4 Jul 2013 09:16:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

From the\nphysical standpoint, the decomposition of the dynamo field into primary and\nsecondary dynamo families proves very instructive in the $\\alpha\\Omega$ case.\nThe same method is then applied to a fully turbulent dynamo in a solar\nconvection zone, modeled with the 3D MHD ASH code.

Researchers have proposed increasingly complex\nenergy models and improved parameter estimation methods in anticipation of\nendowing their methods with enough power to solve the problem. The output has\ndisappointingly been only modest improvements, not matching the expectations.\nEven recent massively featured machine learning approaches were not able to\nbreak the barrier.

We\nsay that the parameters of an energy model are learnable iff there exists at\nleast one set of such parameters that renders every known RNA structure to date\nthe minimum free energy structure. We derive a necessary condition for the\nlearnability and give a dynamic programming algorithm to assess it.

We probe ISM dust composition, total abundances, and\nabundance gradients through the study of interstellar absorption features in\nthe high-resolution X-ray spectra of Galactic low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs).\nWe use high-quality grating spectra of nine LMXBs taken with XMM-Newton.

The column densities of the neutral\ngas species are in agreement with those found in the literature. Solids are a\nsignificant reservoir of metals like oxygen and iron. Respectively, 15-25 % and\n65-90 % of the total amount of O I and Fe I is found in dust. The dust amount\nand mixture seem to be consistent along all the lines-of-sight (LOS). Our\nestimates of abundance gradients and predictions of local interstellar\nabundances are in agreement with those measured at longer wavelengths. Our work\nshows that X-ray spectroscopy is a very powerful method to probe the ISM. For\ninstance, on a large scale the ISM appears to be chemically homogeneous showing\nsimilar gas ionization ratios and dust mixtures. The agreement between the\nabundances of the ISM and the stellar objects suggests that the local Galaxy is\nalso chemically homogeneous.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Jan 2013 17:55:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-20"}

One\nof the prospective observing windows for the LOFAR EoR project will be centered\nat the North Celestial Pole (NCP). We present results from observations of the\nNCP window using the LOFAR highband antenna (HBA) array in the frequency range\n115 MHz to 163 MHz. The data were obtained in April 2011 during the\ncommissioning phase of LOFAR. We used baselines up to about 30 km. With about 3\nnights, of 6 hours each, effective integration we have achieved a noise level\nof about 100 microJy/PSF in the NCP window. Close to the NCP, the noise level\nincreases to about 180 microJy/PSF, mainly due to additional contamination from\nunsubtracted nearby sources. We estimate that in our best night, we have\nreached a noise level only a factor of 1.4 above the thermal limit set by the\nnoise from our Galaxy and the receivers. Our continuum images are several times\ndeeper than have been achieved previously using the WSRT and GMRT arrays. We\nderive an analytical explanation for the excess noise that we believe to be\nmainly due to sources at large angular separation from the NCP.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Jan 2013 18:42:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Jan 2013 13:31:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-19"}

The distance between the two\ndistributions is measured using the Kullback-Leibler divergence, and a\nStochastic EM-type algorithm, driven by the RJ-MCMC sampler, is proposed to\nestimate the parameters. Two signal decomposition problems are considered, to\nshow the capability of VAPoRS both for relabeling and for summarizing variable\ndimensional posterior distributions: the classical problem of detecting and\nestimating sinusoids in white Gaussian noise on the one hand, and a particle\ncounting problem motivated by the Pierre Auger project in astrophysics on the\nother hand.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Jan 2013 19:47:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-09"}

An\nessential element is the mapping of the higher-dimensional equations of motion\nto the light-front Hamiltonian, thus allowing a clear distinction between the\nkinematical and dynamical aspects of the holographic approach to hadron\nphysics. Accordingly, the non-trivial geometry of pure AdS space encodes the\nkinematics, and the additional deformations of AdS space encode the dynamics,\nincluding confinement. It thus becomes possible to identify the features of\nholographic QCD which are independent of the specific mechanisms of conformal\nsymmetry breaking.

In a\nLorentz covariant theory observer space is the space of unit future-directed\ntimelike vectors; picking such a vector locally breaks the symmetry to a\nsubgroup SO(D) of SO(D,1), so that on observer space the local symmetry group\nis SO(D).

We suggest that it is possible to heat\nprecursor grains for chondrules and other high-temperature minerals in current\nsheets that have been concentrated by our recently described short-circuit\ninstability. We extend our work on this process by including the effects of\nradiative cooling, taking into account the temperature dependence of the\nopacity; and by examining current sheet geometry in three-dimensional, global\nmodels of magnetorotational instability. We find that temperatures above 1600 K\ncan be reached for favorable parameters that match the ideal global models.\nThis mechanism could provide an efficient means of tapping the gravitational\npotential energy of the protoplanetary disk to heat grains strongly enough to\nform high-temperature minerals. The volume-filling nature of turbulent magnetic\nreconnection is compatible with constraints from chondrule-matrix\ncomplementarity, chondrule-chondrule complementarity, the occurrence of igneous\nrims, and compound chondrules. The same short-circuit mechanism may perform\nother high-temperature mineral processing in protoplanetary disks such as the\nproduction of crystalline silicates and CAIs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Jan 2013 21:19:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 27 Mar 2013 22:13:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-29"}

However, in the case of continua,\nwherein Kn approaches zero asymptotically, it is nevertheless (implicitly)\nassumed in the literature that the compressible NSF equations remain\napplicable. Surprisingly, this belief appears never to have been critically\ntested; rather, most tests of the viability of the NSF equations for continuum\nflows have, to date, effectively been limited to incompressible fluids, namely\nliquids. Given that bivelocity hydrodynamic theory has recently raised\nfundamental questions about the validity of the NSF equations for compressible\ncontinuum gas flows, we deemed it worthwhile to test the validity of the NSF\nparadigm for the case of continua. Although our proposed NSF test does not,\nitself, depend upon the correctness of the bivelocity model that spawned the\ntest, the latter provided motivation. This Letter furnishes molecular dynamics\n(MD) simulation evidence showing, contrary to current opinion, that the NSF\nequations are not, in fact, applicable to compressible gaseous continua, nor,\npresumably, either to compressible liquids. Importantly, this conclusion\nregarding NSF's inapplicability to continua, is shown to hold independently of\nthe viability of the no-slip boundary condition applied to fluid continua, thus\nseparating the issue of the correctness of the NSF differential equations from\nthat of the tangential velocity boundary condition to be imposed upon these\nequations when seeking their solution. Finally, the MD data are shown to be\nfunctionally consistent with the bivelocity model that spawned the present\nstudy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Jan 2013 23:19:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Jan 2013 15:59:10 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 24 Jan 2013 08:41:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-25"}

Famous privacy\npreserving principles that aim to ensure both data privacy and data integrity,\nsuch as $k$-anonymity and $l$-diversity, have been extensively studied both\ntheoretically and empirically. Nonetheless, these widely-adopted principles are\nstill insufficient to prevent attribute disclosure if the attacker has partial\nknowledge about the overall sensitive data distribution. The $t$-closeness\nprinciple has been proposed to fix this, which also has the benefit of\nsupporting numerical sensitive attributes. However, in contrast to\n$k$-anonymity and $l$-diversity, the theoretical aspect of $t$-closeness has\nnot been well investigated.\n  We initiate the first systematic theoretical study on the $t$-closeness\nprinciple under the commonly-used attribute suppression model. We prove that\nfor every constant $t$ such that $0\\leq t<1$, it is NP-hard to find an optimal\n$t$-closeness generalization of a given table. The proof consists of several\nreductions each of which works for different values of $t$, which together\ncover the full range. To complement this negative result, we also provide exact\nand fixed-parameter algorithms.

In fact, the\nuse of entangling gates permits to reduce two steps (evaluation and\ncalculation) to a single computational one, and this determines an effective\ncomputational speed-up. The application of the open quantum systems model\nsuggests that the reduction to one-computational step is strongly related to\nthe existence of Universal Dynamical Maps describing the evolution of component\nsystems of two-qubits gates. As the description in terms of Universal Dynamical\nMap is possible only in the presence of a separable initial state, it turns out\nthat the internal reduced dynamics with respect to entangling gates is neither\nunitary nor Markovian. The fact imposes a holistic vision on the structure of\nthe algorithm, where the entangling gates shall remain indivisible unities, or\nblack boxes, in order to preserve computational speed as well as reversibility.\nThis fact suggests to adopt a perspective on computation which is completely\nnon-classical: the whole algorithm turns out not to be the sequence of its\ntemporal parts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Jan 2013 10:22:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Dec 2015 08:39:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-24"}

We employ the\nthermodynamic formalism in order to derive estimates for the stable Hausdorff\ndimension function delta^s on Lambda, in the case when f is conformal on local\nstable manifolds. These estimates are in terms of a continuous function on\nLambda which bounds the preimage counting function from below. As a corollary\nwe obtain that if delta^s attains its maximal possible value in Lambda, then\nthe stable dimension is constant throughout Lambda, whereas the preimage\ncounting function is constant on at least an open and dense subset of Lambda.\nIn particular, this shows that if at some point in Lambda, the stable dimension\nis equal to the analogue of the similarity dimension in the stable direction at\nthat point, then f behaves very much like a homeomorphism on Lambda.

Furthermore, it has been\nshown that the constant entropy per hadron is equivalent to constant entropy\nnormalized to cubic temperature, an earlier criterion for the chemical\nfreeze-out introduced in Ref. [Europhys.Lett. 75 (2006) 420, Nucl.Phys.A764\n(2006) 387-392]. In this comment, we list out the ignored literature, compare\nbetween the entropy-number density ratio and two criteria of averaged energy\nper averaged particle number and constant entropy per cubic temperature. All\nthese criteria are confronted to the experimental results. The physics of\nconstant entropy per number density is elaborated. It is concluded that this\nratio can't remain constant, especially at large chemical potential related to\nAGS and SIS energies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Jan 2013 12:32:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-10"}

Any deviation from the isotropy may be regarded to as a signature of\nunforeseen or unknown phenomena, mostly if well localised in the sky and\noccurring at low rigidity. It induced experimenters to search for excesses down\nto angular scale as narrow as 10 degrees, disclosing the issue of properly\nfiltering contributions from wider structures. A solution commonly envisaged in\nthese years based on time-average methods to determine the reference value of\ncosmic ray flux. Such techniques are nearly insensitive to signals wider than\nthe time-window in use, thus allowing to focus the analysis on medium- and\nsmall-scale signals. Nonetheless, often the signal cannot be excluded in the\ncalculation of the reference value, what induce systematic errors. The use of\ntime-average methods recently brought to important discoveries about the\nmedium-scale cosmic ray anisotropy, present both in the northern and southern\nhemisphere. It is known that the excess (or the deficit) is observed as less\nintense than in reality and that fake deficit zones are rendered around true\nexcesses, because of the absolute lack of knowledge a-priori of which signal is\ntrue and which is not. This work is an attempt to critically review the use of\ntime average-based methods for observing extended features in the cosmic-ray\narrival distribution pattern.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Jan 2013 12:49:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

Large solids are\nsupposed to drift inward; high-temperature minerals found in comets are assumed\nto have been transported outward. From low-gravity experiments on parabolic\nflights we studied the light-induced erosion of dusty bodies caused by a\nsolid-state greenhouse effect and photophoresis within a dust bed's upper\nlayers. The gravity levels studied were 0.16g, 0.38g, 1g, and 1.7g. The light\nflux during the experiments was 12 +/- 2 kW/m^2 and the ambient pressure was 6\n+/- 0.9 mbar. Light-induced erosion is strongly gravity dependent, which is in\nagreement with a developed model. In particular for small dusty bodies\n((sub)-planetesimals), efficient erosion is possible at the optically thin\ninner edges of protoplanetary disks. Light-induced erosion prevents significant\nparts of a larger body from moving too close to the host star and be being\nsubsequently accreted. The small dust produced continues to be subject to\nphotophoresis and is partially transported upward and outward over the surface\nof the disk; the resulting small dust particles observed over the disk's\nlifetime. The fraction of eroded dust participates in subsequent cycles of\ngrowth during planetesimal formation. Another fraction of dust might be\ncollected by a body of planetary size if this body is already present close to\nthe disk edge. Either way, light induced erosion is an efficient recycling\nprocess in protoplanetary disks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Jan 2013 14:47:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-21"}

The method is validated on the 3s3p6np series of\nresonances converging to the 3s extraction. Then, it is used for computing the\nenergy dependent differential atomic delay between 3p and 3s photoemission, and\nagreement is found with the measurements of Gu\\'enot et al. [PRA 85 (2012)\n053424]. The effect of the presence of resonances in the one-photon spectrum on\nphotoionization delay measurements is studied.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Jan 2013 15:06:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

Our bi-SQUID SQIF array design is based on a tight integration of\nindividual bi- SQUID cells sharing inductances with adjacent cells. We provide\nextensive computer simulations, analysis and experimental measurements, in\nwhich we explore the phase dynamics and linearity of the array voltage\nresponse. The non-uniformity in inductances of the bi-SQUIDs produces a\npronounced zero-field single antipeak in the voltage response. The anti-peak\nlinearity and size can be optimized by varying the critical current of the\nadditional junction of each bi-SQUID. The layout implementation of the tight 2D\narray integration leads to a distinct geometrical diamond shape formed by the\nmerged dual bi-SQUID cells. Different size 2D arrays are fabricated using\nstandard HYPRES niobium 4.5 kA/cm2 fabrication process. The measured linearity,\npower gain, and noise properties will be analyzed for different array sizes and\nthe results will be compared with circuit simulations. We will discuss a design\napproach for the electrically small magnetic field antenna and low-noise\namplifiers with high bandwidth based on these 2D bi-SQUID SQIF arrays. The\nresults from this work will be used to design chips densely and completely\ncovered in bi-SQUIDs that has optimized parameters such as linearity and power\ngain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Jan 2013 17:55:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-04"}

The wave function is here a manifestation of the\nvelocity field of geodesics of a continuous and non-differentiable (therefore\nfractal) space-time. In a first paper (Paper I), we have presented the general\nargument which leads to this result using an elaborate and more detailed\nderivation than previously displayed. We have therefore been able to show how\nthe complex wave function emerges naturally from the doubling of the velocity\nfield and to revisit the derivation of the non relativistic Schr\\\"odinger\nequation of motion. In the present paper (Paper II) we deal with relativistic\nmotion and detail the natural emergence of the bi-spinors from such first\nprinciples of the theory. Moreover, while Lorentz invariance has been up to now\ninferred from mathematical results obtained in stochastic mechanics, we display\nhere a new and detailed derivation of the way one can obtain a Lorentz\ninvariant expression for the expectation value of the product of two\nindependent fractal fluctuation fields in the sole framework of the theory of\nScale Relativity. These new results allow us to enhance the robustness of our\nderivation of the two main equations of motion of relativistic quantum\nmechanics (the Klein-Gordon and Dirac equations) which we revisit here at\nlength.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Jan 2013 12:27:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Jun 2014 15:54:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-05"}

These larger\nwaveguides feature easier fabrication, higher reliability and better\ninterfacing to optical fibres. Single-mode operation with large core dimensions\nis obtained with low lateral refractive index contrast. Hence, the main\nlimitation in increasing the level of integration and in reducing the cost of\nmicron-scale waveguide circuits is their mm- to cm-scale minimum bending\nradius. Fortunately, single-mode rib waveguides with a micron-scale silicon\ncore can be locally transformed into multi-mode strip waveguides that have very\nhigh lateral index contrast.

A first step towards addressing this\nchallenge is the use of clustering techniques, which is essential in the data\nmining process to reveal natural structures and identify interesting patterns\nin the underlying data. A robust gene expression clustering approach to\nminimize undesirable clustering is proposed. In this paper, Penalized Fuzzy\nC-Means (PFCM) Clustering algorithm is described and compared with the most\nrepresentative off-line clustering techniques: K-Means Clustering, Rough\nK-Means Clustering and Fuzzy C-Means clustering. These techniques are\nimplemented and tested for a Brain Tumor gene expression Dataset. Analysis of\nthe performance of the proposed approach is presented through qualitative\nvalidation experiments. From experimental results, it can be observed that\nPenalized Fuzzy C-Means algorithm shows a much higher usability than the other\nprojected clustering algorithms used in our comparison study. Significant and\npromising clustering results are presented using Brain Tumor Gene expression\ndataset. Thus patterns seen in genome-wide expression experiments can be\ninterpreted as indications of the status of cellular processes. In these\nclustering results, we find that Penalized Fuzzy C-Means algorithm provides\nuseful information as an aid to diagnosis in oncology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Jan 2013 17:16:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-14"}
