The coefficient of restitution (COR), defined\nas the ratio between the relative rebound and impact velocities of a binary\nimpact, is frequently used to characterize the amount of energy dissipation\nassociated. We measure the COR by tracing a freely falling sphere bouncing on a\nwet surface with the liquid film thickness monitored optically. For fixed ratio\nbetween the film thickness and the particle size, the dependence of the COR on\nthe impact velocity and various properties of the liquid film can be\ncharacterized with the Stokes number, defined as the ratio between the inertia\nof the particle and the viscosity of the liquid. Moreover, the COR for\ninfinitely large impact velocities derived from the scaling can be analyzed by\na model considering the energy dissipation from the inertia of the liquid film.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Jan 2013 16:01:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

Our results suggest that the degree of rotational\nsupport and the fate of the gas in a halo is determined by its large-scale\nenvironment and merger history. In particular, the two haloes forming blobs are\nlocated at knots of the cosmic web, cooled early on, and experienced many\nmergers. The gas in these haloes is lumpy and highly turbulent, with Mach N. >~\n5. In contrast, the haloes forming rotationally supported cores are relatively\nmore isolated, located midway along filaments, cooled more recently, and\nunderwent fewer mergers. Thus, the gas in these haloes is less lumpy and less\nturbulent (Mach <~ 4), and could retain most of its AM. The remaining 14 haloes\nhave intermediate properties. If verified in a larger sample of haloes and with\nadditional physics, our results will have implications for observations of the\nhighest-redshift galaxies and quasars with JWST.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Jan 2013 17:05:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

We solve for the intrinsic parameters at the emission\nregion and find the possible parameter phase space for synchrotron emission.\nOur approach is general and it does not depend on a specific energy dissipation\nmechanism. Reasonable synchrotron solutions are found with energy ratios of\n$10^{-4}<\\epsilon_B/\\epsilon_e<10$, bulk Lorentz factor values of\n$300<\\Gamma<3000$, typical electrons' Lorentz factor values of $3\\times\n10^3<\\gamma_e<10^5$ and emission radii of the order $10^{15}cm<R<10^{17}$cm.\nMost remarkable among those are the rather large values of the emission radius\nand the electron's Lorentz factor.

By developing a network of\nsmart appliances together with a quasi-decentralized control protocol, direct\nload control (DLC) provides an opportunity to reduce peak consumption by\ndirectly controlling the on/off switch of the networked appliances. This paper\nproposes a packetized DLC (PDLC) solution that is illustrated by an application\nto air conditioning temperature control. Here the term packetized refers to a\nfixed time energy usage authorization. The consumers in each room choose their\npreferred set point, and then an operator of the local appliance pool will\ndetermine the comfort band around the set point. We use a thermal dynamic model\nto investigate the duty cycle of thermostatic appliances. Three theorems are\nproposed in this paper. The first two theorems evaluate the performance of the\nPDLC in both transient and steady state operation. The first theorem proves\nthat the average room temperature would converge to the average room set point\nwith fixed number of packets applied in each discrete interval. The second\ntheorem proves that the PDLC solution guarantees to control the temperature of\nall the rooms within their individual comfort bands. The third theorem proposes\nan allocation method to link the results in theorem 1 and assumptions in\ntheorem 2 such that the overall PDLC solution works. The direct result of the\ntheorems is that we can reduce the consumption oscillation that occurs when no\ncontrol is applied. Simulation is provided to verify theoretical results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Jan 2013 18:30:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-24"}

The key concept\nis a \"distinction\" of a partition, an ordered pair of elements in distinct\nblocks of the partition. The logical concept of entropy based on partition\nlogic is the normalized counting measure of the set of distinctions of a\npartition on a finite set--just as the usual logical notion of probability\nbased on the Boolean logic of subsets is the normalized counting measure of the\nsubsets (events). Thus logical entropy is a measure on the set of ordered\npairs, and all the compound notions of entropy (join entropy, conditional\nentropy, and mutual information) arise in the usual way from the measure (e.g.,\nthe inclusion-exclusion principle)--just like the corresponding notions of\nprobability. The usual Shannon entropy of a partition is developed by replacing\nthe normalized count of distinctions (dits) by the average number of binary\npartitions (bits) necessary to make all the distinctions of the partition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Jan 2013 19:15:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 26 Jan 2013 01:25:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-29"}

In these 1D\nsystems, the effects of commensurate band fillings--strongest at\nhalf-filling--and electronic repulsions typically lead to a finite charge gap\nand the favoring of insulating density wave ordering over superconductivity.\nAccordingly, recent proposals suggesting a gapless metallic state in the\nHolstein-Hubbard (HH) model, possibly superconducting, have generated\nconsiderable interest and controversy, with the most recent work demonstrating\nthat the putative dominant superconducting state likely does not exist. In this\npaper we study a model with non-local electron-phonon interactions, in addition\nto electron-electron interactions, this model unambiguously possesses dominant\nsuperconducting fluctuations at half filling in a large region of parameter\nspace. Using both the numerical multi-scale functional renormalization group\nfor the full model and an analytic conventional renormalization group for a\nbosonized version of the model, we demonstrate the existence of dominant\nsuperconducting (SC) fluctuations. These dominant SC fluctuations arise because\nthe spin-charge coupling at high energy is weakened by the non-local\nelectron-phonon interaction and the charge gap is destroyed by the resultant\nsuppression of the Umklapp process. The existence of the dominant SC pairing\ninstability in this half-filled 1D system suggests that non-local\nboson-mediated interactions may be important in the superconductivity observed\nin the organic superconductors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Jan 2013 20:59:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-21"}

Most\nAGN are radio quiet because the thin accretion disks that feed them are\ninefficient in depositing magnetic flux close to the black hole. Flux\naccumulation is more likely to occur during a hot accretion (or thick disk)\nphase, and we argue that radio-loud quasars and strong emission-line radio\ngalaxies occur only when a massive, cold accretion event follows an episode of\nhot accretion. Such an event might be triggered by the merger of a giant\nelliptical galaxy with a disk galaxy.\n  This picture supports the idea that flux accumulation can lead to the\nformation of a so-called magnetically choked accretion flow (MCAF). The large\nobserved range in radio loudness reflects not only the magnitude of the flux\npressed against the black hole, but also the decrease in UV flux from the disk,\ndue to its disruption by the \"magnetosphere\" associated with the accumulated\nflux. While the strongest jets result from the secular accumulation of flux,\nmoderate jet activity can also be triggered by fluctuations in the magnetic\nflux deposited by turbulent, hot inner regions of otherwise thin accretion\ndisks, or by the dissipation of turbulent fields in accretion disk coronae.\nThese processes could be responsible for jet production in Seyferts and\nlow-luminosity AGN, as well as jets associated with X-ray binaries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Jan 2013 21:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

These outflows have velocities that exceed 1500 km s$^{-1}$ in some\ncases. Unexpectedly, we find polarization-dependent HI absorption in 57% of our\nspectra (88% and 63% of the FIR-strong and FIR-weak quasars, respectively). We\nattribute this result to absorption of polarized continuum emission from these\nsources by foreground HI clouds. About 60% of the quasars displaying polarized\nspectra are radio-loud, far higher than the $\\sim$10% observed in the general\nAGN population. This discrepancy suggests that radio jets play an important\nrole in shaping the environments in these galaxies. These systems may represent\na transition phase in the evolution of gas-rich mergers into \"mature\" radio\ngalaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Jan 2013 21:00:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

While these features clearly distinguish quantum spin\nliquids from conventional, mean-field-like states at zero temperature (T),\ntheir status at T>0 is less clear. Strictly speaking, it is known that most\nquantum spin liquids lose their identity at non-zero temperature, being in that\ncase adiabatically transformable into a trivial paramagnet. This is the case\nfor the U(1) quantum spin liquid states recently proposed to occur in the\nquantum spin ice pyrochlores.

Through a combination of gauge mean field\ntheory calculations and physical reasoning, we argue that these systems sustain\nboth quantum spin liquid and thermal spin liquid phases, dominated by quantum\nfluctuations and entropy, respectively. These phases are separated by a first\norder \"thermal confinement\" transition, such that for temperatures below the\ntransition, spinons and emergent photons are coherently propagating\nexcitations, and above it the dynamics is classical. Even for parameters for\nwhich the ground state is magnetically ordered and not a quantum spin liquid,\nthis strong first order transition occurs, pre-empting conventional Landau-type\ncriticality.

So far, all attempts to\nrestore susceptibility after resistance has arisen have been unsuccessful,\nincluding restrictions on prescribing [1] and antibiotic cycling [2,3]. Part of\nthe problem may be that those efforts have implemented different classes of\nunrelated antibiotics, and relied on removal of resistance by random loss of\nresistance genes from bacterial populations (drift). Here, we show that\nalternating structurally similar antibiotics can restore susceptibility to\nantibiotics after resistance has evolved. We found that the resistance\nphenotypes conferred by variant alleles of the resistance gene encoding the TEM\n{\\beta}-lactamase (blaTEM) varied greatly among 15 different {\\beta}-lactam\nantibiotics. We captured those differences by characterizing complete adaptive\nlandscapes for the resistance alleles blaTEM-50 and blaTEM-85, each of which\ndiffers from its ancestor blaTEM-1 by four mutations. We identified pathways\nthrough those landscapes where selection for increased resistance moved in a\nrepeating cycle among a limited set of alleles as antibiotics were alternated.\nOur results showed that susceptibility to antibiotics can be sustainably\nrenewed by cycling structurally similar antibiotics.

The isotopic composition of cometary water has been\naccounted for by several models where the isotopic composition of water vapor\nevolved by isotopic exchange with hydrogen gas in the protoplanetary disk.\nHowever, the position and the wide variations of the distribution of D/H ratios\nin carbonaceous chondrites have yet to be explained. In this paper, we assume\nthat the D/H composition of cometary ice was achieved in the disk building\nphase and model the further isotopic evolution of water in the inner disk in\nthe classical T Tauri stage. Reaction kinetics compel isotopic exchange between\nwater and hydrogen gas to stop at $\\sim$500 K, but equilibrated water can be\ntransported to the snow line (and beyond) via turbulent diffusion and\nconsequently mix with isotopically comet-like water. Under certain simplifying\nassumptions, we calculate analytically this mixing and the resulting\nprobability distribution function of the D/H ratio of ice accreted in\nplanetesimals and compare it with observational data. The distribution\nessentially depends on two parameters: the radial Schmidt number Sc$_R$, which\nratios the efficiencies of angular momentum transport and turbulent diffusion,\nand the range of heliocentric distances of accretion sampled by chondrites. The\nminimum D/H ratio of the distribution corresponds to the composition of water\ncondensed at the snow line, which is primarily set by Sc$_R$. Observations\nconstrain the latter to low values (0.1-0.3), which suggests that turbulence in\nthe planet-forming region was hydrodynamical in nature, as would be expected in\na dead zone. Such efficient outward diffusion would also account for the\npresence of high-temperature minerals in comets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Jan 2013 22:45:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

It gives a significant\nperformance improvement (e.g., error for a given computational effort) over the\nvelocity-based scheme. These features are achieved by assigning passive scalars\nto each simulated particle and tracking their evolution through collisions. The\nmethod permits a detailed error analysis that is confirmed by numerical\nresults. The tests performed are for the evolution from anisotropic Maxwellian\nand a bump-on-tail distribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Jan 2013 00:27:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

By considering the\ncondition for the accelerator to be self-sustained, we derive how the\ntrans-magnetic-field thickness of the accelerator evolves with the pulsar age.\nIt is found that the thickness is small but increases steadily if the\nneutron-star envelope is contaminated by sufficient light elements. For such a\nlight element envelope, the gamma-ray luminosity of the accelerator is kept\napproximately constant as a function of age in the initial ten thousand years,\nforming the lower bound of the observed distribution of the gamma-ray\nluminosity of rotation-powered pulsars. If the envelope consists of only heavy\nelements, on the other hand, the thickness is greater but increases less\nrapidly than what a light element envelope has. For such a heavy element\nenvelope, the gamma-ray luminosity decreases relatively rapidly, forming the\nupper bound of the observed distribution. The gamma-ray luminosity of a general\npulsar resides between these two extreme cases, reflecting the envelope\ncomposition and the magnetic inclination angle with respect to the rotation\naxis. The cutoff energy of the primary curvature emission is regulated below\nseveral GeV even for young pulsars, because the gap thickness, and hence the\nacceleration electric field is suppressed by the polarization of the produced\npairs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Jan 2013 07:05:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

Our study\nenables a better understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the\napplicability of these techniques for flows in high-contrast porous media.\nFurthermore, we discuss the robustness of DMD- and POD-based reduced-order\nmodels with respect to variations in initial conditions, permeability fields,\nand forcing terms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Jan 2013 09:45:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

We concentrate upon trying to\nunderstand the dynamics of best response games on regular graphs with many\nstrategies. When more than two strategies are present highly complex dynamics\ncan ensue. We focus upon trying to understand exactly how best response games\non regular graphs sample from the space of possible cellular automata. To\nunderstand this issue we investigate convex divisions in high dimensional space\nand we prove that almost every division of $k-1$ dimensional space into $k$\nconvex regions includes a single point where all regions meet. We then find\nconnections between the convex geometry of best response games and the theory\nof alternating circuits on graphs.

Management of inter-network\ninterference then becomes a key issue for high capacity provision. Tight\noperator-wise cooperation provides superior performance, but at the expense of\nhigh infrastructure cost and business-related barriers.

The commonly\nused viscous prescription for the Maxwell-Reynolds stress tensor gives rise to\na meridional circulation where flow is outward near the midplane and inward\naway from it. This meridional circulation has been proposed as an explanation\nfor the presence of high-temperature minerals (believed to be of inner solar\nsystem provenance) in comets. However, it has not been observed in simulations\nof magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) turbulence so far. In this study, we evaluate\nthe extent to which the net transport of solids can be diagnostic of the\nexistence of meridional circulation. To that end, we propose and motivate a\nprescription for MHD turbulence which has the same free parameters as the\nviscous one. We compare the effects of both prescriptions on the radial\ntransport of small solid particles and find that their net, vertically\nintegrated radial flux is actually quite insensitive to the flow structure for\na given vertical average of the turbulence parameter $\\alpha$, which we\nexplain. Given current uncertainties on disk turbulence, one-dimensional models\nare thus most appropriate to investigate radial transport of solids. A\ncorollary is that the presence of high-temperature material in comets cannot be\nconsidered an unequivocal diagnostic of meridional circulation. In fact, we\nargue that outward transport in viscous disk models is more properly attributed\nto turbulent diffusion rather than to the mean flows of the gas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Jan 2013 15:27:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

Without this process,\nthe universe would be dark and dead. Yet the spontaneous concentration of heat\nis exactly what the Second Law of Thermodynamics is in most cases supposed to\nforbid. The formation of protostars has been much discussed, for its\nconsistency with the Second Law depends on a thermodynamical property that is\ncommon in systems whose strongest force is their own gravity, but otherwise\nvery rare: negative specific heat. Negative specific heat turns the world\nupside down, thermodynamically; it implies that entropy increases when energy\nflows from lower to higher energy subsystems, opposite to the usual direction.\nRecent experiments have reported negative specific heat in melting atomic\nclusters and fragmenting nuclei, but these arguably represent transient\nphenomena outside the proper scope of thermodynamics. Here we show that the\ncounter-intuitive thermodynamics of spontaneous energy concentration can be\nstudied experimentally with trapped quantum gases, by using optical lattice\npotentials to realize weakly coupled arrays of simple dynamical subsystems that\nshare the peculiar property of self-gravitating protostars, of having negative\nmicro-canonical specific heat. Numerical solution of real-time evolution\nequations confirms the spontaneous concentration of energy in such arrays, with\ninitially dispersed energy condensing quickly into dense 'droplets'. We\ntherefore propose laboratory studies of negative specific heat as an elusive\nbut fundamentally important aspect of thermodynamics, which may shed fresh\nlight on the general problem of how thermodynamics emerges from mechanics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Jan 2013 15:54:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-25"}

One of the central issues in\nconstructing such agents is the representation and elicitation of user\npreferences or interests. This topic has long been studied in Decision Theory,\nbut surprisingly little work in the area of recommender systems has made use of\nformal decision-theoretic techniques. This paper describes DIVA, a\ndecision-theoretic agent for recommending movies that contains a number of\nnovel features. DIVA represents user preferences using pairwise comparisons\namong items, rather than numeric ratings. It uses a novel similarity measure\nbased on the concept of the probability of conflict between two orderings of\nitems.

When solving an influence diagram we determine a set of strategies\nfor the decisions involved. A strategy for a decision variable is in principle\na function over its past. However, some of the past may be irrelevant for the\ndecision, and for computational reasons it is important not to deal with\nredundant variables in the strategies. We show that current methods (e.g. the\n\"Decision Bayes-ball\" algorithm by Shachter UAI98) do not determine the\nrelevant past, and we present a complete algorithm.\n  Actually, this paper takes a more general outset: When formulating a decision\nscenario as an influence diagram, a linear temporal ordering of the decisions\nvariables is required. This constraint ensures that the decision scenario is\nwelldefined. However, the structure of a decision scenario often yields certain\ndecisions conditionally independent, and it is therefore unnecessary to impose\na linear temporal ordering on the decisions. In this paper we deal with partial\ninfluence diagrams i.e. influence diagrams with only a partial temporal\nordering specified. We present a set of conditions which are necessary and\nsufficient to ensure that a partial influence diagram is welldefined. These\nconditions are used as a basis for the construction of an algorithm for\ndetermining whether or not a partial influence diagram is welldefined.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Jan 2013 16:00:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-30"}

This paper presents\nan approach to time-critical dynamic decision modeling. A knowledge\nrepresentation and modeling method called the time-critical dynamic influence\ndiagram is proposed. The formalism has two forms. The condensed form is used\nfor modeling and model abstraction, while the deployed form which can be\nconverted from the condensed form is used for inference purposes. The proposed\napproach has the ability to represent space-temporal abstraction within the\nmodel. A knowledge-based meta-reasoning approach is proposed for the purpose of\nselecting the best abstracted model that provide the optimal trade-off between\nmodel quality and model tractability. An outline of the knowledge-based model\nconstruction algorithm is also provided.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Jan 2013 16:01:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-30"}

The underlying idea\nis similar to that behind modified policy iteration for fully observable Markov\ndecision processes (MDPs). The technique can be easily incorporated into any\nexisting POMDP value iteration algorithms. Experiments have been conducted on\nseveral test problems with one POMDP value iteration algorithm called\nincremental pruning.
