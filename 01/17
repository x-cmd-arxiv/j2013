The observed thermal\nX-ray emission can be accompanied by both thermal and nonthermal radio\nemission. Due to variability, simultaneous X-ray and radio observations are a\npriori required, but results have been inconclusive. Aims: We use archival\nX-ray and radio observations of the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) to significantly\nenlarge the sample size of known YSOs with both X-ray and radio detections.\nMethods: We study the ONC using multi-epoch non-simultaneous archival Chandra\nX-ray and NRAO Very Large Array (VLA) single-band radio data. The multiple\nepochs allow us to reduce the impact of variability by obtaining approximated\nquiescent fluxes. Results: We find that only a small fraction of the X-ray\nsources (7%) have radio counterparts, even if 60% of the radio sources have\nX-ray counterparts. The radio flux density is typically too low to distinguish\nthermal and nonthermal radio sources. Only a small fraction of the YSOs with\ndetections in both bands are compatible with the empirical \"Guedel-Benz\" (GB)\nrelation. Most of the sources not compatible with the GB relation are proplyds,\nand thus likely thermal sources, but only a fraction of the proplyds is\ndetected in both bands, such that the role of these sources is inconclusive.\nConclusions: While the radio sources appear to be globally unrelated to the\nX-ray sources, the X-ray dataset clearly is much more sensitive than the radio\ndata. We find tentative evidence that known non-thermal radio sources and\nsaturated X-ray sources are indeed close to the empirical relation, even if\nskewed to higher radio luminosities, as they are expected to be. Most of the\nsources that are clearly incompatible with the empirical relation are proplyds\nwhich could instead plausibly be thermal radio sources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Jan 2013 16:04:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

We find that in Horava-Lifshitz gravity, this approach does not work\nand we fail to reproduce a corresponding Friedmann equation in this theory by\napplying the first law of thermodynamics on the apparent horizon, together with\nthe appropriate expression for the entropy in Horava-Lifshitz gravity. The\nreason for this failure seems to be due to the fact that Horava-Lifshitz\ngravity is not diffeomorphism invariant, and thus, the corresponding field\nequation cannot be derived from the first law around horizon in the spacetime.\nWithout this, it implies that the specific gravitational theory is not\nconsistent, which shows an additional problematic feature of Horrava-Lifshitz\ngravity.

The DTFE technique is based directly on the\nparticle positions, without requiring any type of smoothing or analysis grid,\nthereby providing high sensitivity to all non-linear structures resolved by the\nsimulations. In order to identify the detailed origin of the shape of the\none-point density probability distribution function (PDF), we decompose the\nsimulation particles according to the mass of their host FoF halos, and examine\nthe contributions of different halo mass ranges to the global density PDF. We\nmodel the one-point distribution of the FoF halos in each halo mass bin with a\nset of Monte Carlo realizations of idealized NFW dark matter halos, finding\nthat this reproduces the measurements from the N-body simulations reasonably\nwell, except for a small excess present in simulation results. This excess\nincreases with increasing halo mass. We show that its origin lies in\nsubstructure, which becomes progressively more abundant and better resolved in\nmore massive dark matter halos. We demonstrate that the high density tail of\nthe one-point distribution function in less massive halos is severely affected\nby the gravitational softening length and the mass resolution.

The Io torus has not been\npreviously observed at this local time. The UVIS data consist of 2-D spectrally\ndispersed images of the Io plasma torus in the wavelength range of\n561{\\AA}-1912{\\AA}. We developed a spectral emissions model that incorporates\nthe latest atomic physics data contained in the CHIANTI database in order to\nderive the composition of the torus plasma as a function of radial distance.\nElectron temperatures derived from the UVIS torus spectra are generally less\nthan those observed during the Voyager era. We find the torus ion composition\nderived from the UVIS spectra to be significantly different from the\ncomposition during the Voyager era. Notably, the torus contains substantially\nless oxygen, with a total oxygen-to-sulfur ion ratio of 0.9. The average ion\ncharge state has increased to 1.7.

These correction algorithms are iterative and the\ncontrol methods need an estimate of the electric field at the science camera,\nwhich requires nearly all of the images taken for the correction. The best way\nto make such algorithms the least disruptive to science exposures is to reduce\nthe number required to estimate the field. We demonstrate a Kalman filter\nestimator that uses prior knowledge to create the estimate of the electric\nfield, dramatically reducing the number of exposures required to estimate the\nimage plane electric field while stabilizing the suppression against poor\nsignal-to-noise (SNR). In addition to a significant reduction in exposures, we\ndiscuss the relative merit of this algorithm to estimation schemes that do not\nincorporate prior state estimate history, particularly in regard to estimate\nerror and covariance. Ultimately the filter will lead to an adaptive algorithm\nwhich can estimate physical parameters in the laboratory for robustness to\nvariance in the optical train.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Jan 2013 20:59:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-28"}

Our focus is\non galaxies with gas surface density Sigma_g>~100 Msun pc^-2. In our theory,\nthe galactic disc consists of Toomre-mass GMCs embedded in a volume-filling\nISM. Radiation pressure on dust disperses GMCs and most supernovae explode in\nthe volume-filling medium. A galaxy-averaged star formation law is derived by\nbalancing the momentum input from supernova feedback with the gravitational\nweight of the disc gas. This star formation law is in good agreement with\nobservations for a CO conversion factor depending continuously on Sigma_g. We\nargue that the galaxy-averaged star formation efficiency per free fall time,\nepsilon_ff^gal, is only a weak function of the efficiency with which GMCs\nconvert their gas into stars. This is possible because the rate limiting step\nfor star formation is the rate at which GMCs form: for large efficiency of star\nformation in GMCs, the Toomre Q parameter obtains a value slightly above unity\nso that the GMC formation rate is consistent with the galaxy-averaged star\nformation law. We contrast our results with other theories of\nturbulence-regulated star formation and discuss predictions of our model. Using\na compilation of data from the literature, we show that the galaxy-averaged\nstar formation efficiency per free fall time is non-universal and increases\nwith increasing gas fraction, as predicted by our model. We also predict that\nthe fraction of the disc gas mass in bound GMCs decreases for increasing values\nof the GMC star formation efficiency.

Narrow-band imaging in the near-IR revealed that the\nstructure contains an additional overdensity of 22 z = 2.23 Halpha-emitting\ngalaxies (HAEs), resulting in 23 unique z = 2.23 HAEs/QSOs. Our Chandra\nobservations reveal that 3 HAEs in addition to the 4 QSOs harbor powerfully\naccreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs), with 2-10 keV luminosities of\n~(8-60) x 10^43 ergs/s and X-ray spectral slopes consistent with unobscured\nAGN. Using a large comparison sample of 210 HAEs in Chandra-COSMOS (C-COSMOS),\nwe find suggestive evidence that the AGN fraction increases with local HAE\ngalaxy density. The 2QZ Clus HAEs reside in a moderately overdense environment\n(a factor of ~2 times over the field), and after excluding optically-selected\nQSOs, we find the AGN fraction is a factor of ~3.5^+3.8_-2.2 times higher than\nC-COSMOS HAEs in similar environments. Using stacking analyses of the Chandra\ndata and Herschel SPIRE observations at 250 um, we respectively estimate mean\nSMBH accretion rates (Mdot) and star-formation rates (SFRs) for the 2QZ Clus\nand C-COSMOS samples. We find that the mean 2QZ Clus HAE stacked 2-10 keV\nluminosity is QSO-like (~6-10 x 10^43 ergs/s), and the implied Mdot/SFR \\sim\n(1.6-3.2) x10^-3 is broadly consistent with the local MBH/M* relation and z ~ 2\nX-ray selected AGN. The C-COSMOS HAEs are on average an order of magnitude less\nX-ray luminous and have Mdot/SFR \\sim (0.2-0.4) x10^-3, comparable to z ~ 1-2\nstar-forming galaxies with similar mean X-ray luminosities.

Here we develop a\ncoarse-grained evolutionary statistics for phenotypes, which decouples from\ndetails of the underlying genotypes. We derive approximate evolution equations\nfor the distribution of phenotype values within and across populations. This\ndynamics covers evolutionary processes at high and low recombination rates,\nthat is, it applies to sexual and asexual populations. In a fitness landscape\nwith a single optimal phenotype value, the phenotypic diversity within\npopulations and the divergence between populations reach evolutionary\nequilibria, which describe stabilizing selection. We compute the equilibrium\ndistributions of both quantities analytically and we show that the ratio of\nmean divergence and diversity depends on the strength of selection in a\nuniversal way: it is largely independent of the phenotype's genomic encoding\nand of the recombination rate. This establishes a new method for the inference\nof selection on molecular phenotypes beyond the genome level.

The evidence for either a massive WN\nor a low-mass [WN] interpretation is critically examined, and we firmly\nconclude that Abell 48 is a planetary nebula (PN) around an evolved low-mass\nstar, rather than a Population I ejecta nebula. Importantly, the surrounding\nnebula has a morphology typical of PNe, and is not enriched in nitrogen, and\nthus not the `peeled atmosphere' of a massive star. We estimate a distance of\n1.6 kpc and a reddening, E(B-V) = 1.90 mag, the latter value clearly showing\nthe nebula lies on the near side of the Galactic bar, and cannot be a massive\nWN star. The ionized mass (~0.3 M_Sun) and electron density (700 cm^-3) are\ntypical of middle-aged PNe. The observed stellar spectrum was compared to a\ngrid of models from the Potsdam Wolf-Rayet (PoWR) grid. The best fit\ntemperature is 71 kK, and the atmospheric composition is dominated by helium\nwith an upper limit on the hydrogen abundance of 10 per cent. Our results are\nin very good agreement with the recent study of Todt et al., who determined a\nhydrogen fraction of 10 per cent and an unusually large nitrogen fraction of ~5\nper cent. This fraction is higher than any other low-mass H-deficient star, and\nis not readily explained by current post-AGB models. We give a discussion of\nthe implications of this discovery for the late-stage evolution of\nintermediate-mass stars.

Here, we use Spitzer/IRS spectroscopy of a complete\nvolume-limited sample of local LIRGs (distances of <78Mpc). We estimate typical\nBH masses of 3x10^7 M_sun using [NeIII]15.56micron and optical [OIII]5007A gas\nvelocity dispersions and literature stellar velocity dispersions. We find that\nin a large fraction of local LIRGs the current SFR is taking place not only in\nthe inner nuclear ~1.5kpc region, as estimated from the nuclear 11.3micron PAH\nluminosities, but also in the host galaxy. We next use the ratios between the\nSFRs and BH accretion rates (BHAR) to study whether the SF activity and BH\ngrowth are contemporaneous in local LIRGs. On average, local LIRGs have SFR to\nBHAR ratios higher than those of optically selected Seyferts of similar AGN\nluminosities. However, the majority of the IR-bright galaxies in the RSA\nSeyfert sample behave like local LIRGs. Moreover, the AGN incidence tends to be\nhigher in local LIRGs with the lowest SFRs. All this suggests that in local\nLIRGs there is a distinct IR-bright star forming phase taking place prior to\nthe bulk of the current BH growth (i.e., AGN phase). The latter is reflected\nfirst as a composite and then as a Seyfert, and later as a non-LIRG optically\nidentified Seyfert nucleus with moderate SF in its host galaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Jan 2013 09:04:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

SMC methods carry a set of\nweighted particles through repeated propagation, weighting and resampling\nsteps. The propagation and weighting steps are straightforward to parallelise,\nas they require only independent operations on each particle. The resampling\nstep is more difficult, as standard schemes require a collective operation,\nsuch as a sum, across particle weights. Focusing on this resampling step, we\nanalyse two alternative schemes that do not involve a collective operation\n(Metropolis and rejection resamplers), and compare them to standard schemes\n(multinomial, stratified and systematic resamplers). We find that, in certain\ncircumstances, the alternative resamplers can perform significantly faster on a\nGPU, and to a lesser extent on a CPU, than the standard approaches. Moreover,\nin single precision, the standard approaches are numerically biased for upwards\nof hundreds of thousands of particles, while the alternatives are not. This is\nparticularly important given greater single- than double-precision throughput\non modern devices, and the consequent temptation to use single precision with a\ngreater number of particles.

We confirm that the graphite-silicate mixture\nof grains yields the observed extinction curve with the simple power-law\ndistribution of the grain size but with a cutoff at some maximal size: the\nparameters are tightly constrained to be $q = 3.5 \\pm 0.2$ for the size\ndistribution $a^{-q}$ and the maximum radius $a_{max} = 0.24 \\pm 0.05$ um, for\nboth MW and SMC. The abundance of grains, and hence the elemental abundance, is\nconstrained from the reddening versus hydrogen column density, E(B-V)/N_H. If\nwe take the solar elemental abundance as the standard for the MW, >56 % of\ncarbon should be in graphite dust, while it is <40 % in the SMC using its\navailable abundance estimate. This disparity and the relative abundance of C to\nSi explain the difference of the two curves.

The central position of a generic Ca\ndefect with eight equidistant vanadium neighbors implies a partly filled defect\nband and permits activated transport due to Coulomb disorder. We explore the\neffect of bound charge carriers on the dynamics of the (yz,zx) orbital and spin\ndegrees of freedom in the context of a spin-orbital t-J model. After deriving\nthe superexchange interactions around the doped hole, we show that the\ntransition from G-type to C-type antiferromagnetic (AF) order is triggered by\nthe kinetic energy of doped holes via the double-exchange mechanism. The defect\nstates lead to local modification of orbital correlations within ferromagnetic\nchains along the c axis; some of them contain hole defects, while the\ncharge-orbital coupling suppresses locally (yz,zx) orbital fluctuations in the\nothers. Thereby, Ca defects provide a physical mechanism for spin-orbital\ndimerization along the ferromagnetic bonds, suggesting that, in the C-AF phase\nof weakly doped Y1-xCaxVO3, dimerization increases with doping.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Jan 2013 09:36:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-18"}

We call the\nnormalized volume of the minimally necessary truncation robustness and we seek\nshapes with maximal robustness for fixed values of $N$. While the upward\nrobustness (referring to the increase of $N$) of smooth, homogeneous convex\nsolids is known to be zero, little is known about their downward robustness.\nThe difficulty of the latter problem is related to the coupling (via integrals)\nbetween the geometry of the hull $\\bd K$ and the location of the center of\ngravity $G$. Here we first investigate two simpler, decoupled problems by\nexamining truncations of $\\bd K$ with $G$ fixed, and displacements of $G$ with\n$\\bd K$ fixed, leading to the concept of external \\rm and internal \\rm\nrobustness, respectively. In dimension 2, we find that for any fixed number\n$N=2S$, the convex solids with both maximal external and maximal internal\nrobustness are regular $S$-gons. Based on this result we conjecture that\nregular polygons have maximal downward robustness also in the original, coupled\nproblem. We also show that in the decoupled problems, 3-dimensional regular\npolyhedra have maximal internal robustness, however, only under additional\nconstraints. Finally, we prove results for the full problem in case of 3\ndimensional solids. These results appear to explain why monostatic pebbles\n(with either one stable, or one unstable point of equilibrium) are found so\nrarely in Nature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Jan 2013 10:07:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-20"}

In this thesis we study the gauge theories on\nnoncommutative Moyal space. We find new static solitons and instantons in terms\nof the so called generalized Bose operators. Generalized Bose operators are\nconstructed to describe reducible representation of the oscillator algebra.\nThey create/annihilate $k$-quanta, $k$ being a positive integer. We start with\ngiving an alternative description to the already found static magnetic flux\ntube solutions of the noncommutative gauge theories in terms of generalized\nBose operators. The Nielsen-Olesen vortex solutions found in terms of these\noperators reduce to the already found ones. On the contrary we find a class of\nnew instaton solutions which are unitarily inequivalant to the the ones found\nfrom ADHM construction on noncommutative space. The charge of the instaton has\na description in terms of the index representing the reducibility of the Fock\nspace, i.e., $k$. After studying the static solitonic solutions in\nnoncommutative Minkowski space and the instaton solutions in noncommutative\nEuclidean space we go on to study the implications of the time-space\nnoncommutativity in Minkowski space. To understand it properly we study the\ntime-dependent transitions of a forced harmonic oscillator in noncommutative\n1+1 dimensional spacetime.

Roughly speaking, given the deck of a graph $G$\nand any finite sequence of graphs, it gives a linear constraint that every\nreconstruction of $G$ must satisfy.\n  Let $\\psi(n)$ be the number of distinct (mutually non-isomorphic) graphs on\n$n$ vertices, and let $d(n)$ be the number of distinct decks that can be\nconstructed from these graphs. Then the difference $\\psi(n) - d(n)$ measures\nhow many graphs cannot be reconstructed from their decks. In particular, the\ngraph reconstruction conjecture is true for $n$-vertex graphs if and only if\n$\\psi(n) = d(n)$.\n  We give a framework based on Kocay's lemma to study this discrepancy. We\nprove that if $M$ is a matrix of covering numbers of graphs by sequences of\ngraphs, then $d(n) \\geq \\mathsf{rank}_\\mathbb{R}(M)$. In particular, all\n$n$-vertex graphs are reconstructible if one such matrix has rank $\\psi(n)$. To\ncomplement this result, we prove that it is possible to choose a family of\nsequences of graphs such that the corresponding matrix $M$ of covering numbers\nsatisfies $d(n) = \\mathsf{rank}_\\mathbb{R}(M)$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Jan 2013 15:25:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 6 Sep 2014 21:22:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-09"}

The dynamics of such systems is governed solely by interactions\namong individuals or \"agents,\" with the tendency to adjust to their\n`environmental averages'. This, in turn, leads to the formation of clusters,\ne.g., colonies of ants, flocks of birds, parties of people, etc. A natural\nquestion which arises in this context is to understand when and how clusters\nemerge through the self-alignment of agents, and what type of \"rules of\nengagement\" influence the formation of such clusters. Of particular interest to\nus are cases in which the self-organized behavior tends to concentrate into one\ncluster, reflecting a consensus of opinions, flocking or concentration of other\npositions intrinsic to the dynamics.\n  Many standard models for self-organized dynamics in social, biological and\nphysical science assume that the intensity of alignment increases as agents get\ncloser, reflecting a common tendency to align with those who think or act\nalike. Moreover, \"Similarity breeds connection,\" reflects our intuition that\nincreasing the intensity of alignment as the difference of positions decreases,\nis more likely to lead to a consensus. We argue here that the converse is true:\nwhen the dynamics is driven by local interactions, it is more likely to\napproach a consensus when the interactions among agents \\emph{increase} as a\nfunction of their difference in position. \\emph{Heterophily} --- the tendency\nto bond more with those who are different rather than with those who are\nsimilar, plays a decisive r\\^{o}le in the process of clustering. We point out\nthat the number of clusters in heterophilious dynamics \\emph{decreases} as the\nheterophily dependence among agents increases. In particular, sufficiently\nstrong heterophilious interactions enhance consensus.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Jan 2013 16:42:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 2 Feb 2013 15:52:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 8 May 2014 14:34:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-09"}

The origin of AC conductivity\nparticularly in the high frequency region was attributed to the electronic\npolarization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Jan 2013 12:48:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-21"}

The\nprimary focus of this paper will be on the novel minimalistic design of i-HY,\nwhich was developed by choosing a set of target tasks around which the design\nof the hand was optimized.

This non-thermality cancels\nexactly between the ground-state estimate and its free quasiparticle\nexcitations. Kinematic constraints in 4-vertex scattering and the counting of\nradial loop variables versus the number of independent constraints on them are\nre-visited. Next, we consider thermal 2$\\rightarrow$ 2 one-loop scattering of\nthe modes remaining massless upon the (anti)caloron induced adjoint Higgs\nmechanism (thermal ground state after spatial coarse graining). Starting with\nstringent analytical arguments, we are able to exclude the contribution to\nphoton-photon scattering from diagrams containing at least one three-vertex\nand, in a next step, a vast majority of all possible configurations involving\ntwo four-vertices. By numerical analysis we show that the remaining\ncontribution of the overall S channel is severely suppressed compared to that\nof the T and U channels, meaning that the creation of a pair of massive vector\nmodes by a pair of photons and vice versa practically does not occur in the\nYang-Mills plasma. For the T and U channels the domain of loop integration\nrepresents less than $10^{-7}$ times the volume of the unconstrained\nintegration region. The thus introduced photon-photon correlation should affect\nthe Cosmic Microwave Background's polarisation at low redshift.
