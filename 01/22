There are many logical\nsystems, and many ways of formalizing them, e.g., using natural deduction or\nsequent calculus. Calculus of structures (CoS) is a new formalism proposed by\nAlessio Guglielmi in 2004 that generalizes sequent calculus in the sense that\ninference rules can be applied at any depth inside a formula, rather than only\nto the main connective. With this feature, proofs in CoS are shorter than in\nany other formalism supporting analytical proofs. Although it is great to have\nthe freedom and expressiveness of CoS, under the point of view of proof search\nmore freedom means a larger search space. And that should be restricted when\nlooking for complete automation of deductive systems. Some efforts were made to\nreduce this non-determinism, but they are all basically operational approaches,\nand no solid theoretical result regarding the computational behaviour of CoS\nhas been achieved so far. The main focus of this thesis is to discuss ways to\npropose a proof search strategy for CoS suitable to implementation. This\nstrategy should be theoretical instead of purely operational. We introduce the\nconcept of incoherence number of substructures inside structures and we use\nthis concept to achieve our main result: there is an algorithm that, according\nto our conjecture, corresponds to a proof search strategy to every provable\nstructure in the subsystem of FBV (the multiplicative linear logic MLL plus the\nrule mix) containing only pairwise distinct atoms. Our algorithm is implemented\nand we believe our strategy is a good starting point to exploit the\ncomputational aspects of CoS in more general systems, like BV itself.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Jan 2013 16:19:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-22"}

In circumstances where one is\ninterested in specific autocorrelation functions that do not fit into any\nsimple families of models, such as auto-regressive moving average (ARMA),\nestimating model parameters is generally approached in one of two ways: by\nfitting the model autocorrelation function to a non-parameteric autocorrelation\nestimate via regression analysis or by fitting the model autocorrelation\nfunction directly to the data via maximum likelihood. Prior literature suggests\nthat variogram regression yields parameter estimates of comparable quality to\nmaximum likelihood. In this letter we demonstrate that, as sample size is\nincreases, the accuracy of the maximum-likelihood estimates (MLE) ultimately\nimproves by orders of magnitude beyond that of variogram regression. For\nrelatively continuous and Gaussian processes, this improvement can occur for\nsample sizes of less than 100.

However, the AC susceptibility revealed a dilute-spin-glass like\ntransition below ~ 1 K. Antiferromagnetically coupled Mo5+ 4d1 electrons in\ntriply degenerate t2g orbitals are in this material arranged in a geometrically\nfrustrated fcc lattice. Bulk magnetic susceptibility data has previously been\ninterpreted in terms of a freezing to a heterogeneous state with non-magnetic\nsites where 4d^1 electrons have paired in spin-singlets dimers, and residual\nunpaired Mo5+ 4d1 electrons. Based on the magnetic heat capacity data it has\nbeen suggested that this heterogeneity is the result of kinetic constraints\nintrinsic to the physics of the pure system (possibly due to topological\noverprotection), leading to a self-induced glass of valence bonds between\nneighbouring 4d1 electrons. The muSR relaxation unambiguously points to a\nstatic heterogeneous state with a static arrangement of unpaired electrons\nisolated by spin-singlet (valence bond) dimers between the majority of Mo5+ 4d\nelectrons. The AC susceptibility data indicate that the residual magnetic\nmoments freeze into a dilute-spin-glass-like state.

We point out that\nduring a transit of an Earth-mass planet across a WD, the planet's atmospheric\ntransmission spectrum obtains a much higher contrast over the stellar\nbackground compared to a main-sequence host, because of the small surface area\nof the WD. The most prominent bio-marker in the present-day terrestrial\natmosphere, molecular oxygen, is readily detectable in a WD transit via its\nA-band absorption at ~0.76 micron. A potentially life-sustaining Earth-like\nplanet transiting a WD can be found by assembling a suitable sample of ~500 WDs\nand then surveying them for transits using small telescopes.

We find that the correlation\nfunction of peaks with high signal-to-noise (S/N) measured from fields of size\n144 sq. deg. has a maximum of ~0.3 at an angular scale ~10 arcmin. For peaks\nwith smaller S/N, the amplitude of the correlation function decreases, and its\nmaximum occurs on smaller angular scales. We compare the peak observables\nmeasured with and without shape noise and find that for S/N~3 only ~5% of the\npeaks are due to large-scale structures, the rest being generated by shape\nnoise. The covariance matrix of the probes is examined: the correlation\nfunction is only weakly covariant on scales < 30 arcmin, and slightly more on\nlarger scales; the shear profiles are very correlated for theta > 2 arcmin,\nwith a correlation coefficient as high as 0.7. Using the Fisher-matrix\nformalism, we compute the cosmological constraints for {Om_m, sig_8, w, n_s}\nconsidering each probe separately, as well as in combination. We find that the\ncorrelation function of peaks and shear profiles yield marginalized errors\nwhich are larger by a factor of 2-4 for {Om_m, sig_8} than the errors yielded\nby the peak abundance alone, while the errors for {w, n_s} are similar. By\ncombining the three probes, the marginalized constraints are tightened by a\nfactor of ~2 compared to the peak abundance alone, the least contributor to the\nerror reduction being the correlation function. This work therefore recommends\nthat future WL surveys use shear peaks beyond their abundance in order to\nconstrain the cosmological model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Jan 2013 21:02:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

The investigation of\nthe solid-fluid transition in a rheometric flow in the presence and in the ab-\nsence of the wall slip reveals a coupling between the irreversible deformation\nstates and the wall slip phenomenon. Particularly, the presence of wall slip\nnearly suppresses the scaling of the deformation power deficit associated to\nthe rheological hysteresis with the rate at which the material is forced. The\nirreversible solid-fluid transition and the wall slip behaviour emerge in the\nsame range of the applied stresses and thus, the two phenomena appear to be\ncoupled to each other. In-situ measurements of the flow fields performed during\nan increasing/decreasing stepped pressure ramp reveal three distinct flow\nregimes: solid (pluglike), solid-fluid and fluid. The deformation power deficit\nassociated with the hysteresis observed during the increasing/decreasing\nbranches of the pressure ramps reveals a dependence on the rate at which the\nunsteady flow is driven consistent with that observed during the rheological\nmeasurements in the presence of slip. The dependence of the slip velocity on\nthe wall shear stresses reveals a Navier-type slip behaviour only within the\nfluid flow regime, which indicates that the wall slip phenomenon is directly\ncoupled to the solid-fluid transition. A universal scaling of the slip velocity\nwith the wall velocity gradients is found and the slip length is independent on\nthe characteristic time of forcing t0.

The goal is to test\nwhether the implementation of radio mode AGN feedback, which is responsible for\nterminating the formation of stars in high mass galaxies, provides an adequate\nmatch to current high-redshift observations. The fraction of quenched galaxies\nas a function of stellar mass in the models is in good agreement with data at\nz=0 and z=1. By z=2, there are too few quenched galaxies with low stellar\nmasses in the models. At z=2, the population of galaxies with no ongoing star\nformation is clearly separated from the `main sequence' of star-forming\ngalaxies in the data.

The current\nimplementation of radio mode feedback from such black holes reduces the cooling\nrates from the surrounding halo, but does not generate sufficient energy to\nstop star formation entirely.

It appears that when b_e and b_h have identical gaussian\ndistributions the contribution of soft pairs to the current does not depend on\nB. Amazingly, small inequivalence in the rms values of b_e and b_h gives rise\nto a magnetic field response, and it becomes progressively stronger as the\ninequivalence increases.

Another source of magnetic field\nresponse in the regime when current is dominated by soft pairs is inequivalence\nof the g-factors of the pair partners.

We then\npropose an optimal resource allocation algorithm to characterize the achievable\nrate region of the multi-subcarrier DF relay strategy. The computational\ncomplexity of this algorithm is much smaller than that of standard Lagrangian\nduality optimization algorithms. We further analyze the asymptotic performance\nof two-way relay strategies including the above two DF relay strategies and an\namplify-and-forward (AF) relay strategy. The analysis shows that the\nmulti-subcarrier DF relay strategy tends to achieve the capacity region of the\ntwo-way OFDM relay channels in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime,\nwhile the AF relay strategy tends to achieve the multiplexing gain region of\nthe two-way OFDM relay channels in the high SNR regime. Numerical results are\nprovided to justify all the analytical results and the efficacy of the proposed\noptimal resource allocation algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Jan 2013 02:31:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 2 Mar 2013 06:19:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 21 Mar 2013 01:10:29 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 24 Mar 2013 07:00:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-26"}

The latter are usually regarded as a central concept\nof cryptography, but the very existence of one-way functions depends on\ndifficult conjectures in complexity theory, most notably on the notorious \"$P\n\\ne NP$\" conjecture.\n  In this paper, we suggest protocols for secure computation of the sum,\nproduct, and some other functions, without using any one-way functions. A new\ninput that we offer here is that, in contrast with other proposals, we conceal\n\"intermediate results\" of a computation. For example, when we compute the sum\nof $k$ numbers, only the final result is known to the parties; partial sums are\nnot known to anybody.

The first part deals with questions\nrelating to Haghverdi and Scott's notion of partially traced categories. The\nmain result is a representation theorem for such categories: we prove that\nevery partially traced category can be faithfully embedded in a totally traced\ncategory. Also conversely, every monoidal subcategory of a totally traced\ncategory is partially traced, so this characterizes the partially traced\ncategories completely. The main technique we use is based on Freyd's\nparacategories, along with a partial version of Joyal, Street, and Verity's Int\nconstruction. Along the way, we discuss some new examples of partially traced\ncategories, mostly arising in the context of quantum computation.\n  The second part deals with the construction of categorical models of\nhigher-order quantum computation. We construct a concrete semantic model of\nSelinger and Valiron's quantum lambda calculus, which has been an open problem\nuntil now. We do this by considering presheaf categories over appropriate base\ncategories arising from first-order quantum computation. The main technical\ningredients are Day's convolution theory and Kelly and Freyd's notion of\ncontinuity of functors. We first give an abstract description of the properties\nrequired of the base categories for the model construction to work; then\nexhibit a specific example of base categories satisfying these properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Jan 2013 06:52:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-23"}

Zeta Pup is the X-ray brightest O-type star of the sky. This object\nwas regularly observed with the RGS instrument aboard XMM-Newton for\ncalibration purposes, leading to an unprecedented set of high-quality spectra.\nAims. We have previously reduced and extracted this data set and combined it\ninto the most detailed high-resolution X-ray spectrum of any early-type star so\nfar. Here we present the analysis of this spectrum accounting for the presence\nof structures in the stellar wind. Methods. For this purpose, we use our new\nmodeling tool that allows fitting the entire spectrum with a multi-temperature\nplasma. We illustrate the impact of a proper treatment of the radial dependence\nof the X-ray opacity of the cool wind on the best-fit radial distribution of\nthe temperature of the X-ray plasma. Results. The best fit of the RGS spectrum\nof Zeta Pup is obtained assuming no porosity. Four plasma components at\ntemperatures between 0.10 and 0.69 keV are needed to adequately represent the\nobserved spectrum. Whilst the hardest emission is concentrated between ~3 and 4\nR*, the softer emission starts already at 1.5 R* and extends to the outer\nregions of the wind. Conclusions. The inferred radial distribution of the\nplasma temperatures agrees rather well with theoretical expectations.

We then relate\nminimax regret to the channel capacity when the channel is either Gaussian or\nPoisson. In this case, we characterize the minimax regret and the minimax\nestimator more explicitly. If we further assume that the uncertainty set\nconsists of deterministic signals, the worst case regret is exactly equal to\nthe corresponding channel capacity, namely the maximal mutual information\nattainable across the channel among all possible distributions on the\nuncertainty set of signals. The corresponding minimax estimator is the Bayesian\nestimator assuming the capacity-achieving prior.

The epochs covered its rotation period and, by following\nits changing shape and orientation on the plane of sky, we obtained its\ntriaxial ellipsoid dimensions and spin pole location. An independent\ndetermination from images at three epochs obtained in 2007 is in good agreement\nwith these results. By combining these two data sets, along with a single epoch\ndata set obtained in 2003, we have derived a global fit for (52) Europa of\ndiameters (379x330x249) +/- (16x8x10) km, yielding a volume-equivalent\nspherical-diameter of 315 +/- 7 km, and a rotational pole within 7 deg of [RA;\nDec] = [257,+12] in an Equatorial J2000 reference frame (ECJ2000: 255,+35).\nUsing the average of all mass determinations available forEuropa, we derive a\ndensity of 1.5 +/- 0.4, typical of C-type asteroids. Comparing our images with\nthe shape model of Michalowski et al. (A&A 416, 2004), derived from optical\nlightcurves, illustrates excellent agreement, although several edge features\nvisible in the images are not rendered by the model. We therefore derived a\ncomplete 3-D description of Europa's shape using the KOALA algorithm by\ncombining our imaging epochs with 4 stellar occultations and 49 lightcurves. We\nuse this 3-D shape model to assess these departures from ellipsoidal shape.\nFlat facets (possible giant craters) appear to be less distinct on (52) Europa\nthan on other C-types that have been imaged in detail. We show that fewer giant\ncraters, or smaller craters, is consistent with its expected impact history.\nOverall, asteroid (52) Europa is still well modeled as a smooth triaxial\nellipsoid with dimensions constrained by observations obtained over several\napparitions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Jan 2013 08:25:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

In this work, we first derive an innovative formulation of\nthe problem over acyclic overlay networks with arbitrary underlay capacity\nconstraints. Then, based on the formulation, we develop a distributed algorithm\nto achieve the maximum broadcast rate and every user only maintains one queue\nper-neighbor. Due to its lightweight nature, our algorithm scales very well\nwith the network size and remains robust against high system dynamics.

We provide explicit expressions for the\nunconditional first crossing distribution which is usually used to model the\nhalo mass function, the progenitor distributions, and the conditional\ndistributions from which correlations with environment are usually estimated.\nThese latter exhibit perhaps the simplest form of what is often called nonlocal\nbias, and which we prefer to call stochastic bias, since the new bias effects\narise from `hidden-variables' other than density, but these may still be\ndefined locally. We provide explicit expressions for these new bias factors. We\nalso provide formulae for the distribution of heights at first crossing in the\nunconditional and conditional cases. In contrast to the first crossing\ndistribution, these are exact, even for moving barriers, and for walks with\ncorrelated steps. The conditional distributions yield predictions for the\ndistribution of halo concentrations at fixed mass and formation redshift. They\nalso exhibit assembly bias like effects, even when the steps in the walks\nthemselves are uncorrelated. Finally, we show how the predictions are modified\nif we add the requirement that halos form around peaks: these depend on whether\nthe peaks constraint is applied to a combination of the overdensity and the\nother variable, or to the overdensity alone.

The transmitters can partially cooperate with each other\nusing a conferencing link with a limited rate. In addition, a backward public\nchannel is assumed between the terminals. The problem of secret key sharing\nconsists of two rounds. In the first round, the transmitters wish to share a\ncommon key with the legitimate receiver. Lower and upper bounds on the common\nkey capacity are established. In a special case, the capacity of the common key\nis obtained.

In\nthis study, we explored if generation and cycle-by-cycle control of\nDrosophila's wingbeat are functionally separated, or if the steering muscles\ninstead couple into the myogenic rhythm as a weak forcing of a limit cycle\noscillator. We behaviourally tested tethered flying flies for characteristic\nproperties of limit cycle oscillators.

The flies synchronized with\nthe stimulus for specific ranges of stimulus amplitude and frequency, revealing\nthe characteristic Arnold tongues of a forced limit cycle oscillator. Rapid\nperiodic modulation of the wingbeat frequency prior to locking demonstrates the\ninvolvement of the fast steering muscles in the observed control of the\nwingbeat frequency.

Two main cases are considered: smooth variations of the\ngraphene conductivity (characterized by a Gaussian conductivity profile) and\nsharp variations (represented by islands with different conductivity).

The approach\nis simply to minimize the negative log-likelihood of the hidden path, where the\nlikelihood is expressed relative to Wiener measure. This negative\nlog-likelihood is the action integral of the path, which we minimize by\ncalculus of variations. We then perform an asymptotic maximum-likelihood\nanalysis to understand better how the actual path is distributed around the\nleast-action path; it turns out that the actual path can be expressed\n(approximately) as the sum of the least-action path and a zero-mean Gaussian\nprocess which can be specified quite explicitly. Numerical solution of the ODEs\nwhich arise from the calculus of variations is often feasible, but is\ncomplicated by the shooting nature of the problem, and the possibility that we\nhave found a local but not global minimum. We analyze the situations when this\nhappens, and provide effective numerical methods for studying this. We also\nshow how the methodology works in a situation where the hidden positive\ndiffusion acts as the random intensity of a point process which is observed;\nhere too it is possible to estimate the hidden process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Jan 2013 11:47:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-23"}

We develop a theoretical framework aimed at\npredicting the behaviour of existing drag reduction techniques when used at the\nlarge values of Re which are typical of applications. We focus on one recently\nproposed and very promising technique, which consists in creating at the wall\nstreamwise-travelling waves of spanwise velocity. A perturbation analysis of\nthe Navier-Stokes equations that govern the fluid motion is carried out, for\nthe simplest wall-bounded flow geometry, i.e. the plane channel flow. The\nstreamwise base flow is perturbed by the spanwise time-varying base flow\ninduced by the travelling waves. An asymptotic expansion is then carried out\nwith respect to the velocity amplitude of the travelling wave. The analysis,\nalthough based on several assumptions, leads to predictions of drag reduction\nthat agree well with the measurements available in literature and mostly\ncomputed through DNS of the full Navier-Stokes equations. New DNS data are\nproduced on purpose in this work to validate our method further. The method is\nthen applied to predict the drag-reducing performance of the\nstreamwise-travelling waves at increasing Re, where comparison data are not\navailable. The current belief, based on a Re-range of about one decade only\nabove the transitional value, that drag reduction obtained at low Re is deemed\nto decrease as Re is increased is fully confirmed by our results. From a\nquantitative standpoint, however, our outlook based on several decades of\nincrease in Re is much less pessimistic than other existing estimates, and\nmotivates further, more accurate studies on the present subject.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Jan 2013 13:32:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-23"}

For a specific\nobserved data set, answers to the following questions would be desirable: (1)\nEstimation: Which candidate distribution provides the best fit to the observed\ndata?, (2) Goodness-of-fit: How concordant is this distribution with the\nobserved data?, and (3) Uncertainty: How concordant are other candidate\ndistributions with the observed data? A simple unified approach for univariate\ndata that addresses these traditionally distinct statistical notions is\npresented called \"maximum fidelity\". Maximum fidelity is a strict frequentist\napproach that is fundamentally based on model concordance with the observed\ndata. The fidelity statistic is a general information measure based on the\ncoordinate-independent cumulative distribution and critical yet previously\nneglected symmetry considerations. An approximation for the null distribution\nof the fidelity allows its direct conversion to absolute model concordance (p\nvalue). Fidelity maximization allows identification of the most concordant\nmodel distribution, generating a method for parameter estimation, with\nneighboring, less concordant distributions providing the \"uncertainty\" in this\nestimate. Maximum fidelity provides an optimal approach for parameter\nestimation (superior to maximum likelihood) and a generally optimal approach\nfor goodness-of-fit assessment of arbitrary models applied to univariate data.\nExtensions to binary data, binned data, multidimensional data, and classical\nparametric and nonparametric statistical tests are described. Maximum fidelity\nprovides a philosophically consistent, robust, and seemingly optimal foundation\nfor statistical inference.

Our procedure builds a one-way\ntransducer, which is equivalent to the two-way transducer, whenever one exists.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Jan 2013 14:43:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 26 Apr 2013 12:04:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-29"}

The multi-scaled\nbehavior typical of complex dynamics is provided by a fat-tailed distribution\nof the waiting time between consecutive jumps. We first argue that CTRW are\ninadequate to describe macroscopic relaxation processes for three reasons:\nmacroscopic variables are not self-averaging, memory effects require an\nall-knowing observer,and different mechanisms whereby the jumps affect\nmacroscopic variables all produce identical long time relaxation behaviors.\nHence, CTRW shed no light on the link between microscopic and macroscopic\ndynamics. We then highlight how a more recent approach, Record Dynamics (RD)\nprovides a viable alternative, based on a very different set of physical ideas:\nwhile CTRW make use of a renewal process involving identical traps of infinite\nsize, RD embodies a dynamical entrenchment into a hierarchy of traps which are\nfinite in size and possess different degrees of meta-stability.

The study of waves in the solar\ncorona is usually based on linear ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) for a fully\nionized plasma. However, the plasma in the photosphere and the chromosphere is\nonly partially ionized. Here we investigate theoretically the impact of partial\nionization on MHD wave propagation in cylindrical flux tubes in the two-fluid\nmodel. We derive the general dispersion relation that takes into account the\neffects of neutral-ion collisions and the neutral gas pressure. We take the\nneutral-ion collision frequency as an arbitrary parameter. Particular results\nfor transverse kink modes and slow magnetoacoustic modes are shown. We find\nthat the wave frequencies only depend on the properties of the ionized fluid\nwhen the neutral-ion collision frequency is much lower that the wave frequency.\nFor high collision frequencies realistic of the solar atmosphere ions and\nneutrals behave as a single fluid with an effective density corresponding to\nthe sum of densities of both fluids and an effective sound velocity computed as\nthe average of the sound velocities of ions and neutrals. The MHD wave\nfrequencies are modified accordingly. The neutral gas pressure can be neglected\nwhen studying transverse kink waves but it has to be taken into account for a\nconsistent description of slow magnetoacoustic waves. The MHD waves are damped\ndue to neutral-ion collisions. The damping is most efficient when the wave\nfrequency and the collision frequency are of the same order of magnitude. For\nhigh collision frequencies slow magnetoacoustic waves are more efficiently\ndamped than transverse kink waves. In addition, we find the presence of\ncut-offs for certain combinations of parameters that cause the waves to become\nnon-propagating.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Jan 2013 15:48:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

Here, we report hyperthermia and high-frequency\nhysteresis loop measurements on a model system consisting of MNPs with the same\nsize but a varying anisotropy, which is an interesting way to tune the relative\nstrength of magnetic interactions. A clear correlation between the MNP\nanisotropy and the squareness of their hysteresis loop in colloidal solution is\nobserved : the larger the anisotropy, the smaller the squareness. Since low\nanisotropy MNPs display a squareness higher than the one of magnetically\nindependent nanoparticles, magnetic interactions enhance their heating power in\nthis case. Hysteresis loop calculations of independent and coupled MNPs are\ncompared to experimental results. It is shown that the observed features are a\nnatural consequence of the formation of chains and columns of MNPs during\nhyperthermia experiments: in these structures, when the MNP magnetocristalline\nanisotropy is small enough to be dominated by magnetic interactions, the\nhysteresis loop shape tends to be rectangular, which enhance their efficiency.\nOn the contrary, when MNPs do not form chains and columns, magnetic\ninteractions reduces the hysteresis loop squareness and the efficiency of MNPs\ncompared to independent ones. The present work should improve the understanding\nand interpretation of magnetic hyperthermia experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Jan 2013 23:35:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}
