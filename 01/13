However, the mechanism that leads to a\nspecific size selection of the liposomes in solution based self-assembly in\ngeneral, and in flow-focussing microfluidic devices in particular, has so far\nnot been established. Here we report two aspects of this problem. A simple and\neasily fabricated device for synthesis of monodisperse unilamellar liposomes in\na co-axial flow-focussing microfluidic geometry is presented. We also show that\nthe size of liposomes is dependent on the extent of micro-convective mixing of\nthe two miscible phases. Here, a viscosity stratification induced hydrodynamic\ninstability leads to a gentle micro-mixing which results in larger liposome\nsize than when the streams are mixed turbulently. The results are in sharp\ncontrast to a purely diffusive mixing in macroscopic laminar flow that was\nbelieved to occur under these conditions. Further precise quantification of the\nmixing characteristics should provide the insights to develop a general theory\nfor size selection for the class of ethanol injection methods. This will also\nlay grounds for obtaining empirical evidence that will enable better control of\nliposome sizes and for designing drug encapsulation and delivery devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Jan 2013 17:43:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 11 May 2013 05:45:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-14"}

In our model of\nthe moon illusion, the sky is considered a spatially-contiguous and\ngeometrically-smooth surface. When an object such as the moon breaks the\ncontiguity of the surface, instead of perceiving the object as appearing\nthrough a hole in the surface, humans perceive an occlusion of the surface.\nBinocular vision dictates that the moon is distant, but this perception model\ncontradicts our binocular vision, dictating that the moon is closer than the\nsky. To resolve the contradiction, the brain distorts the projections of the\nmoon to increase the binocular disparity, which results in an increase in the\nperceived size of the moon. The degree of distortion depends upon the apparent\ndistance to the sky, which is influenced by the surrounding objects and the\ncondition of the sky. As the apparent distance to the sky decreases, the\nillusion becomes stronger. At the horizon, apparent distance to the sky is\nminimal, whereas at the zenith, few distance cues are present, causing\ndifficulty with distance estimation and weakening the illusion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Jan 2013 20:12:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Sep 2016 04:56:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-29"}

A spectral feature, consisting of\neither an emission line at approximately 0.75 keV or absorption at\napproximately 0.46 keV, is modulated in strength with the rotation.

The model, which we treat\nusing poor-man's scaling and the numerical renormalization group, exhibits\nquantum phase transitions of different types depending on the strength of the\nimpurity-boson coupling. For weak impurity-boson coupling, the suppression of\nthe density of states near the Fermi energy leads to quantum phase transitions\nbetween strong-coupling (Kondo) and local-moment phases.

In this paper, the\nclient association in 60 GHz wireless access networks is investigated. The AP\nutilization and the quality of the rapidly vanishing communication links are\nthe control parameters. Because of the tricky non-convex and combinatorial\nnature of the client association optimization problem, a novel solution method\nis developed to guarantee balanced and fair resource allocation. A new\ndistributed, lightweight and easy to implement association algorithm, based on\nLagrangian duality theory and subgradient methods, was proposed.

CHAMPs with\na decay lifetime of about 1 yr induce characteristic suppression in the matter\npower spectrum at subgalactic scales through acoustic oscillations in the\nthermal background. We explore structure formation in such a model. We also\nstudy three WDM models, where the dark matter particles are produced through\nthe following mechanisms: i) WDM particles are produced in the thermal\nbackground and then kinematically decoupled; ii) WDM particles are fermions\nproduced by the decay of thermal heavy bosons; and iii) WDM particles are\nproduced by the decay of non-relativistic heavy particles. We show that the\nlinear matter power spectra for the three models are all characterised by the\ncomoving Jeans scale at the matter-radiation equality. Furthermore, we can also\ndescribe the linear matter power spectrum for the Long-Lived CHAMP model in\nterms of a suitably defined characteristic cut-off scale k_{Ch}, similarly to\nthe WDM models. We perform large cosmological N-body simulations to study the\nnon-linear growth of structures in these four models. We compare the halo mass\nfunctions, the subhalo mass functions, and the radial distributions of subhalos\nin simulated Milky Way-size halos.

The result suggests that\nthe cut-off scale k_{cut} not only characterises the linear power spectra but\nalso can be used to predict the non-linear clustering properties.

In current implementation, the only way to determine the traffic\nload on a channel is to measure that channel for a certain duration of time.\nTherefore, in order to find the best channel with the minimum load all channels\nhave to be measured, which is costly and can cause unacceptable communication\ninterruptions between the AP and the stations. In this paper, we propose a\nlearning based approach which aims to find the channel with the minimum load by\nmeasuring only limited number of channels. Our method uses Gaussian Process\nRegressing to accurately track the traffic load on each channel based on the\nprevious measured load.

Multiple choice (or labeling) questions could be\nreferred to as a common type of problem which is solved by this approach. As an\napplication, crowd labeling is applied to find true labels for large machine\nlearning datasets. Since crowds are not necessarily experts, the labels they\nprovide are rather noisy and erroneous. This challenge is usually resolved by\ncollecting multiple labels for each sample, and then aggregating them to\nestimate the true label. Although the mechanism leads to high-quality labels,\nit is not actually cost-effective. As a result, efforts are currently made to\nmaximize the accuracy in estimating true labels, while fixing the number of\nacquired labels.\n  This paper surveys methods to aggregate redundant crowd labels in order to\nestimate unknown true labels. It presents a unified statistical latent model\nwhere the differences among popular methods in the field correspond to\ndifferent choices for the parameters of the model.

To a $C^{*}$ algebra $A$ with $\\dim A > 1$, we assign\nthe undirected graph $\\Gamma^{+} (A)$ of non zero positive zero divisors. For\nthe Calkin algebra $A=B(H)/K(H)$, we show that $\\Gamma^{+}(A)$ is a connected\ngraph and diam $\\Gamma^{+}(A)= 3$. We show that $\\Gamma^{+}(A)$ is a connected\ngraph with $\\text {diam}\\; \\Gamma^{+}(A)\\leq 6$, if $A$ is a factor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Jan 2013 09:02:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Jan 2013 20:11:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 23 Jan 2013 10:53:37 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 5 Apr 2013 20:59:09 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 22 Apr 2013 19:07:36 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Sat, 11 May 2013 12:01:08 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Wed, 15 May 2013 18:29:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-16"}

Security requirements and business rules may impose\nconstraints on which users are permitted to perform those steps. A workflow\nspecification is said to be satisfiable if there exists an assignment of\nauthorized users to workflow steps that satisfies all the constraints. An\nalgorithm for determining whether such an assignment exists is important, both\nas a static analysis tool for workflow specifications, and for the construction\nof run-time reference monitors for workflow management systems. We develop new\nmethods for determining workflow satisfiability based on the concept of\nconstraint expressions, which were introduced recently by Khan and Fong. These\nmethods are surprising versatile, enabling us to develop algorithms for, and\ndetermine the complexity of, a number of different problems related to workflow\nsatisfiability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Jan 2013 13:56:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Mar 2013 08:14:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-14"}
