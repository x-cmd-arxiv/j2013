Since the Systems Biology still does not provide the most\naccurate answers to our questions due to the complexity of cells and the\nlimited quality of available information to perform a good gene/protein map\nanalysis, we have created simpler models to ensure easier analysis of the map\nthat represents the human cell. Therefore, a virtual organism has been designed\naccording to the main physiological rules for humans in order to replicate the\nhuman organism and its vital functions. This toy model was constructed by\ndefining the topology of its genes/proteins and the biological functions\nassociated to it. There are several examples of these toy models that emulate\nnatural processes to perform analysis of the virtual life in order to design\nthe best strategy to understand real life. The strategy applied in this study\ncombines topological and functional analysis integrating the knowledge about\nthe relative position of a node among the others in the map with the\nconclusions generated by mathematical models that reproduce functional data of\nthe virtual organism.

A central problem is determining the probability that a\nsmall number of mutants overtake a population. Currently, Monte Carlo\nsimulations are used for estimating such fixation probabilities on general\ndirected graphs, since no good analytical methods exist. In this paper, we\nintroduce a novel deterministic framework for computing fixation probabilities\nfor strongly connected, directed, weighted evolutionary graphs under neutral\ndrift. We show how this framework can also be used to calculate the expected\nnumber of mutants at a given time step (even if we relax the assumption that\nthe graph is strongly connected), how it can extend to other related models\n(e.g. voter model), how our framework can provide non-trivial bounds for\nfixation probability in the case of an advantageous mutant, and how it can be\nused to find a non-trivial lower bound on the mean time to fixation. We provide\nvarious experimental results determining fixation probabilities and expected\nnumber of mutants on different graphs. Among these, we show that our method\nconsistently outperforms Monte Carlo simulations in speed by several orders of\nmagnitude.

The antennas are connected directly to the data acquisition of the Tunka\nmain detector, a 1 square-km large array of 133 non-imaging photomultipliers\nobserving the Cherenkov light of air showers in dark and clear nights. This\nallows to cross-calibrate the radio signal with the air-Cherenkov signal of the\nsame air showers - in particular with respect to the energy and the atmospheric\ndepth of the shower maximum, Xmax. Consequently, we can test whether in rural\nregions with low radio background the practically achievable radio precision\ncomes close to the precision of the established fluorescence and air-Cherenkov\ntechniques. At a mid-term perspective, due to its higher duty-cycle, Tunka-Rex\ncan enhance the effective observing time of Tunka by an order of magnitude, at\nleast in the interesting energy range above 100 PeV.

Yet, it is still unclear what drives the precise amount of hot gas\naround these galaxies. By combining photometric and spectroscopic measurements\nfor the early-type galaxies observed during the Atlas3D integral-field survey\nwith measurements of their X-ray luminosity based on X-ray data of both low and\nhigh spatial resolution we conclude that the hot-gas content of early-type\ngalaxies can depend on their dynamical structure. Specifically, whereas slow\nrotators generally have X-ray halos with luminosity L_X,gas and temperature T\nvalues that are in line with what is expected if the hot-gas emission is\nsustained by the thermalisaton of the kinetic energy carried by the\nstellar-mass loss material, fast rotators tend to display L_X,gas values that\nfall consistently below the prediction of this model, with similar T values\nthat do not scale with the stellar kinetic energy as observed in the case of\nslow rotators. Considering that fast rotators are likely to be intrinsically\nflatter than slow rotators, and that the few L_X,gas-deficient slow rotators\nalso happen to be relatively flat, the observed L_X,gas deficiency in these\nobjects would support the hypothesis whereby flatter galaxies have a harder\ntime in retaining their hot gas. We discuss the implications that a different\nhot-gas content could have on the fate of both acquired and internally-produced\ngaseous material, considering in particular how the L_X,gas deficiency of fast\nrotators would make them more capable to recycle the stellar-mass loss material\ninto new stars than slow rotators.

But if disks are\nturbulent, this neglects a spectrum of stochastic density fluctuations that can\nproduce rare, high-density mass concentrations. Here, we use a\nrecently-developed analytic framework to predict the statistics of these\nfluctuations, i.e. the rate of fragmentation and mass spectrum of fragments\nformed in a turbulent Keplerian disk. Turbulent disks are never completely\nstable: we calculate the (always finite) probability of forming\nself-gravitating structures via stochastic turbulent density fluctuations in\nsuch disks. Modest sub-sonic turbulence above Mach number ~0.1 can produce a\nfew stochastic fragmentation or 'direct collapse' events over ~Myr timescales,\neven if Q>>1 and cooling is slow (t_cool>>t_orbit). In trans-sonic turbulence\nthis extends to Q~100. We derive the true Q-criterion needed to suppress such\nevents, which scales exponentially with Mach number. We specify to turbulence\ndriven by MRI, convection, or spiral waves, and derive equivalent criteria in\nterms of Q and the cooling time. Cooling times >~50*t_dyn may be required to\ncompletely suppress fragmentation. These gravoturbulent events produce mass\nspectra peaked near ~M_disk*(Q*M_disk/M_star)^2 (rocky-to-giant planet masses,\nincreasing with distance from the star).

A surprising discrepancy, by an order\nof magnitude, has been reported in recent offset measurements in nearby spiral\ngalaxies. Measurements using CO and H-alpha emission find large and ordered\noffsets in M51. On the contrary, small or non-ordered offsets have been found\nusing the HI 21cm and 24 micron emissions, possible evidence against gas flow\nthrough spiral arms, and thus against the conventional density-wave theory with\na stationary spiral pattern. The goal of this paper is to understand the cause\nof this discrepancy. We investigate potential causes by repeating those\nprevious measurements using equivalent data, methods, and parameters. We find\noffsets consistent with the previous measurements and conclude that the\ndifference of gas tracers, i.e., HI versus CO, is the primary cause. The HI\nemission is contaminated significantly by the gas photo-dissociated by\nrecently-formed stars and does not necessarily trace the compressed gas, the\nprecursor of star formation. The HI gas and star forming regions coincide\nspatially and tend to show small offsets. We find mostly positive offsets with\nsubstantial scatter between CO and H-alpha, suggesting gas flow through spiral\narms (i.e., density-wave) though the spiral pattern may not necessarily be\nstationary.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Jan 2013 21:01:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-17"}

In this study we explore whether the environment of the Milky Way\naffects the properties of the SMC and LMC such as their velocities. To test for\nthe effect of the environment, we compare velocity distributions for MC-sized\nsubhalos around Milky Way hosts in a sample selected simply by mass and in the\nsecond sample of such halos selected with additional restrictions on the\ndistance to the nearest cluster and the local galaxy density, designed to mimic\nthe environment of the Local Group (LG).

Our second theoretical contribution is a Bayesian regret bound for\nposterior sampling that applies broadly and can be specialized to many model\nclasses. This bound depends on a new notion we refer to as the eluder\ndimension, which measures the degree of dependence among action rewards.\nCompared to UCB algorithm Bayesian regret bounds for specific model classes,\nour general bound matches the best available for linear models and is stronger\nthan the best available for generalized linear models.

The radiation over the\nthermal/ram pressure ratio time evolution is calculated explicitely and the\ncrucial role of the cluster mechanical power and of the strong time evolution\nof the ionizing photon flux and of the bolometric luminosity of the exciting\ncluster is stressed. It is shown that radiation has only a narrow window of\nopportunity to dominate the wind-driven shell dynamics. This may occur only at\nearly stages of the bubble evolution and if the shell expands into a dusty\nand/or a very dense proto-cluster medium. The impact of radiation pressure on\nthe wind-driven shell becomes always negligible after about 3 Myr. Finally, the\nwind-driven model results allow one to compare the model predictions with the\ndistribution of thermal pressure derived from X-ray observations. The shape of\nthe thermal pressure profile allows then to distinguish between the energy and\nthe momentum dominated regimes of expansion and thus conclude whether radiative\nlosses of energy or the leakage of hot gas from the bubble interior have been\nsignificant during the bubble evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Jan 2013 22:05:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

However, how exactly\nstar formation is proceeding within these circumnuclear starburst rings is\nsubject of debate. Two main scenarios for this process have been put forward:\nIn the first the onset of star formation is regulated by the total amount of\ngas present in the ring with star forming starting once a mass threshold has\nreached in a `random' position within the ring like `popcorn'. In the second\nstar formation preferentially takes place near the locations where the gas\nenters the ring. This scenario has been dubbed `pearls-on-a-string'. Here we\ncombine new optical IFU data covering the full stellar bar with existing\nmulti-wavelength data to study in detail the 580 pc radius circumnuclear\nstarburst ring in the nearby spiral galaxy NGC 6951. Using HST archival data\ntogether with Sauron and Oasis IFU data, we derive the ages and stellar masses\nof star clusters as well as the total stellar content of the central region.\nAdding information on the molecular gas distribution, stellar and gaseous\ndynamics and extinction, we find that the circumnuclear ring in NGC 6951 is\n~1-1.5 Gyr old and has been forming stars for most of that time. We see\nevidence for preferred sites of star formation within the ring, consistent with\nthe `pearls-on-a-string' scenario, when focusing on the youngest stellar\npopulations. Due to the ring's longevity this signature is washed out when\nolder stellar populations are included in the analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Jan 2013 22:26:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

Waveforms computed in General\nRelativity are used to search for these sources, and will probably be used to\nextract source parameters from detected signals. However, if a different theory\nof gravity happens to be correct in the strong-field regime, source-parameter\nestimation may be affected by a fundamental bias: that is, by systematic errors\ninduced due to the use of waveforms derived in the incorrect theory. If the\ndeviations from General Relativity are not large enough to be detectable on\ntheir own and yet these systematic errors remain significant (i.e., larger than\nthe statistical uncertainties in parameter estimation), fundamental bias cannot\nbe corrected in a single observation, and becomes stealth bias. In this article\nwe develop a scheme to determine in which cases stealth bias could be present\nin gravitational-wave astronomy. For a given observation, the answer depends on\nthe detection signal-to-noise ratio and on the strength of the modified-gravity\ncorrection. As an example, we study three representative stellar-mass binary\nsystems that will be detectable with second-generation ground-based\nobservatories. We find that significant systematic bias can occur whether or\nnot modified gravity can be positively detected, for correction strengths that\nare not currently excluded by any other experiment. Thus, stealth bias may be a\ngeneric feature of gravitational-wave detections, and it should be considered\nand characterized, using expanded models such as the parametrized post-Einstein\nframework, when interpreting the results of parameter-estimation analyses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Jan 2013 23:05:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

One approach to characterize a deepwater reservoir and to predict its\nproducibility is by analyzing its depositional information.

In this framework, one critical task is\nthe identification and labeling of the stratigraphic components in the\nreservoir, according to their depositional environments. This interpretation\nprocess is labor intensive and can produce different results depending on the\nstratigrapher who performs the analysis. To relieve stratigrapher's workload\nand to produce more consistent results, we have developed a novel methodology\nto automate this process using various computational intelligence techniques.\nUsing a well log data set, we demonstrate that the developed methodology and\nthe designed workflow can produce finite state transducer models that interpret\ndeepwater reservoir depositional environments adequately.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Jan 2013 01:23:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-15"}

In disk galaxies the bulge is the spheroid of interest. We explore\nthe evolution of the M_BH-sigma relation when bulges form together with SMBHs\non the M_BH-sigma relation and then slowly reform a disk around them. The\nformation of the disk compresses the bulge raising its sigma. We present\nevidence for such compression in the form of larger velocity dispersion of\nclassical bulges compared with elliptical galaxies at the same mass. This\ncompression leads to an offset in the M_BH-sigma relation if it is not\naccompanied by an increased M_BH. We quantify the expected offset based on\nphotometric data and show that, on average, SMBHs must grow by ~ 50-65% just to\nremain on the M_BH-sigma relation. We find no significant offset in the\nM_BH-sigma relations of classical bulges and of ellipticals, implying that\nSMBHs have been growing along with disks.

In this paper we put forward artifact-centric multi-agent systems, a\nnovel formalisation of artifact systems in the context of multi-agent systems\noperating on them. Differently from the usual process-based models of services,\nthe semantics we give explicitly accounts for the data structures on which\nartifact systems are defined. We study the model checking problem for\nartifact-centric multi-agent systems against specifications written in a\nquantified version of temporal-epistemic logic expressing the knowledge of the\nagents in the exchange. We begin by noting that the problem is undecidable in\ngeneral. We then identify two noteworthy restrictions, one syntactical and one\nsemantical, that enable us to find bisimilar finite abstractions and therefore\nreduce the model checking problem to the instance on finite models. Under these\nassumptions we show that the model checking problem for these systems is\nEXPSPACE-complete. We then introduce artifact-centric programs, compact and\ndeclarative representations of the programs governing both the artifact system\nand the agents. We show that, while these in principle generate infinite-state\nsystems, under natural conditions their verification problem can be solved on\nfinite abstractions that can be effectively computed from the programs.

Finally, we reconstruct the function $f(T)$ which\nmimics cosmic expansion history.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Jan 2013 06:52:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}
