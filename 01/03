They can be used to obtain information on the\ndynamics and physical conditions of the observed regions. In order to obtain\nreliable constraints on the physical conditions prevailing in the masing\nregions, it is necessary to model the excitation mechanisms of the energy\nlevels of the observed molecules. We present a numerical method that enables us\nto obtain self-consistent solutions for both the statistical equilibrium and\nradiative transfer equations. Using the standard maser theory, the method of\nShort Characteristics is extended to obtain the solution of the\nintegro-differential radiative transfer equation, appropriate to the case of\nintense masing lines. We have applied our method to the maser lines of the H2O\nmolecule and we compare with the results obtained with a less accurate\napproach. In the regime of large maser opacities we find large differences in\nthe intensity of the maser lines that could be as high as several orders of\nmagnitude. The comparison between the two methods shows, however, that the\neffect on the thermal lines is modest. Finally, the effect introduced by rate\ncoefficients on the prediction of H2O masing lines and opacities is discussed,\nmaking use of various sets of rate coefficients involving He, o-H2 and p-H2. We\nfind that the masing nature of a line is not affected by the selected\ncollisional rates. However, from one set to the other the modelled line\nopacities and intensities can vary by up to a factor ~2 and ~10 respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Jan 2013 16:03:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

If the rate of events per unit time\nis sufficiently high, the resulting background is Gaussian, which is to say\nthat it is characterized only by a gravitational-wave strain power spectrum.\nAlternatively, if the event rate is low, we expect a non-Gaussian background,\ncharacterized by intermittent sub-threshold bursts.

The study of\nthese objects is extended from Classical T Tauri stars to the Herbig Ae star HD\n104237. Spectro-interferometry with the VLTI/AMBER is presented.\n  It is found that the K-band continuum squared visibilities are compatible\nwith a circumbinary disc with a radius of ~0.5 AU. However, a significant\nfraction (~50 per cent) of the flux is unresolved and not fully accounted by\nthe stellar photospheres. The stars probably don't hold circumstellar discs, in\naddition to the circumbinary disk, due to the combined effects of inner\nmagnetospheric truncation and outer tidal truncation. This unresolved flux\nlikely arises in compact structures inside the tidally disrupted circumbinary\ndisc.\n  Most ($\\gtrsim 90$ per cent) of the Br gamma line emission is unresolved. The\nline-to-continuum spectro-astrometry shifts in time, along the direction of the\nLy alpha jet known to be driven by the system. The shift is anti-correlated\nwith the Br gamma equivalent width. It is shown that the unresolved Br gamma\nemission cannot originate in the jet but instead is compatible with stellar\nemission from the orbiting binary components. The increase in the absolute\nvalue of the equivalent width of the line takes place at periastron passage; it\ncould arise in an accretion burst, a flare or in the increase in effective size\nof the emission region by the interaction of the magnetospheres. The binary\nlongitude of the ascending node is found to be $\\Omega=(235\\pm3)\\degr$ and the\norbit retrograde.\n  The origin of the jet is revisited. The tidal disruption of the circumstellar\ndisks creates difficulties to ejection models that rely on stellar\nmagnetosphere and disc coupling. A scenario of a stellar wind collimated by a\ncircumbinary disc wind is suggested.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Jan 2013 17:36:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Jan 2013 11:43:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-25"}

It is important to develop a\nframework to begin studying and learning the physical processes possible under\nthose conditions and what, if any, features contained in them may be observed\nin future observation missions. The aims of this study is to formally derive,\nfrom scaling arguments, a manageable reduced set of equations for analysis,\ni.e. a magnetic formulation of the equations of quasigeostrophy appropriate for\na multi-layer atmosphere. The main goal is to provide a simpler theoretical\nplatform to explore the dynamics possible within confined magnetized layers of\nexoplanet atmospheres. We primarily use scaling arguments to derive the reduced\nequations of \"magnetoquasigeostrophy\" which assumes dynamics to take place in\nan atmospheric layer which is vertically thin compared to its horizontal\nscales. The derived equation set retains features existing in standard\nshallow-water magnetohydrodynamic equations but are absent in more classical\nderivations of the quasi-geostrophic limit, namely, the non-divergence of the\nin-plane components of the magnetic field. We liken this non-divergence of the\nin-plane magnetic fields as indicative of a quantity whose behaviour mimics a\ntwo-dimensional \"pseudo\"-magnetic monopole source. We also find, using the same\nscaling argument procedures, appropriate limits of the fundamental parameters\nof the system which yield reduced equations describing the flow dynamics\nprimarily characterized by magnetostrophic balance. The standard scaling\narguments employed here show how traditional magnetized quasigeostrophic\nequations connect to their magnetized shallow water forms. The equations\nderived are amenable to analysis using well-known techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Jan 2013 18:08:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-03"}

Thanks to the WFC3 grism on HST it is\nnow possible to measure this beyond the local Universe. Here we present the\nspatial distribution of Halpha emission for a sample of 54 strongly\nstar-forming galaxies at z~1 in the 3D-HST Treasury survey. By stacking the\nHalpha emission we find that star formation occurred in approximately\nexponential distributions at z~1, with median Sersic index of n=1.0+-0.2. The\nstacks are elongated with median axis ratios of b/a=0.58+-0.09 in Halpha,\nconsistent with (possibly thick) disks at random orientation angles. Keck\nspectra obtained for a subset of eight of the galaxies show clear evidence for\nrotation, with inclination-corrected velocities of 90 to 330 km/s. The most\nstraightforward interpretation of our results is that star formation in\nstrongly star-forming galaxies at z~1 generally occurred in disks. The disks\nappear to be \"scaled-up\" versions of nearby spiral galaxies: they have\nEW(Halpha)~100 Angstroms out to the solar orbit and they have star formation\nsurface densities above the threshold for driving galactic scale winds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Jan 2013 21:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

These two clocks have been widely used\nto estimate SF timescales from moderate-resolution spectra of early-type\ngalaxies.

We measure the interline\nbackground at 1.520 microns where the instrumental thermal background is very\nlow and study its variation with zenith distance, time after sunset, ecliptic\nlatitude, lunar zenith angle and lunar distance to determine the presence of\nnon-thermal atmospheric emission, zodiacal scattered light and scattered\nmoonlight. Zodiacal scattered light is too faint to be detected in the summed\nobservations. Scattered moonlight due to Mie scattering by atmospheric aerosols\nis seen at small lunar distances (< 11 deg), but is otherwise too faint to\ndetect. Except at very small lunar distances the interline background at a\nresolving power of R~2400 when using OH suppression fibres is dominated by a\nnon-thermal atmospheric source with a temporal behaviour that resembles\natmospheric OH emission suggesting that the interline background contains\ninstrumentally-scattered OH. However, the interline background dims more\nrapidly than OH early in the night suggesting contributions from rapid dimming\nmolecules. The absolute interline background is 560 +/- 120 photons s^-1 m^-2\nmicron^-1 arcsec^-2 under dark conditions. This value is similar to previous\nmeasurements without OH suppression suggesting that non-suppressed atmospheric\nemission is responsible for the interline background.

We present a geometric approach for blind separation of nonnegative\nlinear mixtures termed {\\em facet component analysis} (FCA). The approach is\nbased on facet identification of the underlying cone structure of the data.\nEarlier works focus on recovering the cone by locating its vertices (vertex\ncomponent analysis or VCA) based on a mutual sparsity condition which requires\neach source signal to possess a stand-alone peak in its spectrum. We formulate\nalternative conditions so that enough data points fall on the facets of a cone\ninstead of accumulating around the vertices. To find a regime of unique\nsolvability, we make use of both geometric and density properties of the data\npoints, and develop an efficient facet identification method by combining data\nclassification and linear regression. For noisy data, we show that denoising\nmethods may be employed, such as the total variation technique in imaging\nprocessing, and principle component analysis. We show computational results on\nnuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopic data to substantiate our method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Jan 2013 21:58:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-04"}

Recently several novel approaches\nbased on measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC) techniques attempted to\nresolve this problem. The key element is to explore the global structure of a\ngiven circuit, defined via translation into a corresponding MBQC pattern. It is\nknown that the parallel power of MBQC is superior to the quantum circuit model,\nand hence in these approaches one could apply the MBQC depth optimisation\ntechniques to achieve a lower depth. However, currently, once the obtained\nparallel pattern is translated back to a quantum circuit, one should either\nincrease the depth or add ancilla qubits.

Molecular gas has now been\nobserved in close to 200 galaxies at z>1, including numerous AGN host-galaxies\nout to z~7, highly starforming sub-millimeter galaxies (median redshift z~2.5),\nand increasing samples of 'main-sequence' star forming galaxies at z~1.5-2.5.\nStudies have moved well beyond simple detections, to dynamical imaging at\nkpc-scale resolution, and multi-line, multi-species studies that determine the\nphysical conditions in the interstellar medium. Observations of the cool gas\nare the required complement to studies of the stellar density and star\nformation history of the Universe, as they reveal the phase of the interstellar\nmedium that immediately precedes star formation. Current observations suggest\nthat the order of magnitude increase in the cosmic star formation rate density\nfrom z~0 to 2 is commensurate with a similar increase in the gas to stellar\nmass ratio in star forming disk galaxies.

The\naim of this work is to determine stellar parameters using spectroscopy and\ninterferometry. The observations are used to constrain the model atmosphere,\nand eventually the stellar evolutionary model in the region where the tracks\nmap the beginning of the carbon star sequence. Two different approaches are\nused to determine stellar parameters: (i) the 'classic' interferometric\napproach where the effective temperature is fixed by using the angular diameter\nin the N-band (from interferometry) and the apparent bolometric magnitude; (ii)\nparameters are obtained by fitting a grid of state-of-the-art hydrostatic\nmodels to spectroscopic and interferometric observations. We find a good\nagreement between the parameters of the two methods. The effective temperature\nand luminosity clearly place TX Psc in the carbon-rich AGB star domain in the\nH-R-diagram. Current evolutionary tracks suggest that TX Psc became a C-star\njust recently, which means that the star is still in a 'quiet' phase compared\nto the subsequent strong-wind regime.

The states of \\Pi^+ symmetry, known to be\nbroadened due to predissociation and giving rise to asymmetric Beutler-Fano\nresonances, were studied up to v = 18. The 10 m normal incidence beamline setup\nat BESSY II was used to simultaneously record absorption, dissociation,\nionization and fluorescence decay channels from which information on the line\nintensities, predissociated widths, and Fano q-parameters were extracted.\nR-branch transitions were observed up to v = 23 for J = 1-3 as well as several\ntransitions for J = 4 and 5 up to v = 22 and 18 respectively. The Q-branch\ntransitions are found to weakly predissociate and were observed from v = 8 to\nthe final vibrational level of the state v = 23. The spectroscopic study is\nsupported by two theoretical frameworks. Results on the \\Pi^- symmetry states\nare compared to ab initio multi-channel-quantum defect theory (MQDT)\ncalculations, demonstrating that these calculations are accurate to within 0.5\ncm^-1.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Jan 2013 10:35:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-04"}

We confirm past results that the P-Cygni absorption components of the\nlines mostly evolve from a higher expansion velocity to lower velocity as an\nepisode progresses. We also commonly find blueshifted emission components in\nthe Halpha line profile, whose velocities and durations strongly suggest that\nthey are also due to the wind. We suggest that the progression from larger to\nsmaller expansion velocities is due the higher velocity portions of a wind\nconcentration moving beyond the edge of the continuum light of the disk first,\nleaving a net redward shift of the remaining absorption profile. We also derive\na new orbital ephemeris for BZ Cam, using the radial velocity of the core of\nthe HeI 5876AA line, finding P = 0.15353(4). Using this period the wind\nepisodes in BZ Cam are found to be concentrated near inferior conjuction of the\nemission line source. This result confirms that the winds in nova-like CVs are\noften phase dependent, in spite of the puzzling implication that such winds\nlack axisymmetry. We argue that the radiation-driven wind in BZ Cam receives an\ninitial boost by acting on gas that has been lifted above the disk by the\ninteraction of the accretion stream with the disk, thereby imposing flickering\ntime scales onto the wind events, as well as leading to an orbital modulation\nof the wind due to the non-axisymmetric nature of the stream/disk interaction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Jan 2013 13:34:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-04"}
