Despite the potential\nimportance of these eco evolutionary feedback loops, they have not yet been\ndemonstrated experimentally in social species and their ecological implications\nare poorly understood.

The theory is then applied to cosmology. A\ncomplete gauge invariant treatment of the scalar perturbations is presented.\nFor appropriate gauge invariant variables describing the scalar modes of the\nvector field (A-modes), it is proved that the evolution equations of these\nmodes do not involve the scalar modes appearing in General Relativity\n(GR-modes), which are associated to the metric and the energy momentum tensor\nof the cosmological fluids. However, the A-modes modify the standard gauge\ninvariant equations describing the GR-modes.

A mobile fraction\ncontributes to Fermi surface sheets, whereas a localized portion at higher\nbinding energies is tentatively attributed to electrons trapped by O-vacancies\nin the SrTiO3. While photovoltage effects in the polar LaAlO3 layers cannot be\nexcluded, the apparent absence of surface-related Fermi surface sheets could\nalso be fully reconciled in a recently proposed electronic reconstruction\npicture where the built-in potential in the LaAlO3 is compensated by surface\nO-vacancies serving also as charge reservoir.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Jan 2013 21:29:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Jun 2013 18:03:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-19"}

One interesting observed phenomenon is\noscillations in filaments, activated by distant flares and the large-scale\nwaves they produce. Characteristics of these oscillations, such as periods,\namplitudes, and lifetimes, can provide unique information about the filament.\nWe measure oscillation properties in flares and filaments from H-alpha\nchromospheric data using a new method that provides important spatial and\nfrequency content of the dynamics. We apply the method to two flare events\nwhere filaments are observed to oscillate and determine their properties. We\nfind strong oscillatory signal in flaring active regions in the chromosphere\nover a range of frequencies. Two filaments are found to oscillate without any\ndetectable chromospheric wave acting as an activation mechanism. We find that\nfilaments oscillate with periods of tens of minutes, but variations are\nsignificant at small spatial scales along the filamentary region. The results\nsuggest there is a frequency dependence of the oscillation amplitude, as well\nas a spatial dependence along single filaments that is more difficult to\nquantify. It also appears that the strength of the oscillations do not\nnecessarily depend on the strength of the trigger, although there are other\npossible effects that make this conclusion preliminary. Applications of this\ntechnique to other events and different data sets will provide important new\ninsights into the local energy densities and magnetic fields associated with\ndynamic chromospheric structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Jan 2013 21:32:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-14"}

Adult stages live in human gastro-intestinal tract and are\nanaerobic. They move inside the body by releasing gas bubbles utilizing jet\npropulsion. These worms look like a rope, and can be over a meter long. The\ndevelopment stages were identified based on their morphology. The fifth stage\nlooks like a tough string of mucus about a meter long. The fourth stage looks\nsimilar, but the rope worm is shorter and has softer slimier body. The third\nstage looks like branched jellyfish. The second stage is viscous snot, or mucus\nwith visible gas bubbles that act as suction cups. The first stage is slimier\nmucus with fewer bubbles, which can reside almost anywhere in the body. Rope\nworms have cellular structure, based on optical microscopy, DAPI staining and\nDNA analysis, however, the data collected is not sufficient to identify the\nspecie.

In this paper we argue that, during inflation, the\nelectroweak vacuum can actually be very short-lived, contrary to the conclusion\nthat follows from the flat spacetime analysis. Namely, in the case of a pure\nHiggs potential the electroweak vacuum decays via the Hawking-Moss transition,\nwhich has no flat spacetime analogue. As a result, the Higgs vacuum is\nunstable, unless the rate of inflation is low enough: $H_{\\rm inf}\\lesssim\n10^9-10^{12}$ GeV. Models of inflation with such a low rate typically predict\nnegligible tensor perturbations in the cosmic microwave background radiation\n(CMBR). This is also true for models in which the perturbations are produced by\na curvaton field. We also find that if the effective curvature of the Higgs\npotential at a local maximum (which may be induced by inflaton-Higgs\ninteractions) is large enough, then the decay of the electroweak vacuum is\ndominated by the Coleman-de Luccia transition. The electroweak vacuum is also\nshort-lived in this case, due to a negative effective self-interaction\ncoupling. Based on our analysis of Higgs vacuum stability during inflation, we\nconclude that the observation of tensor perturbations by the Planck satellite\nwould provide strong indirect evidence for new physics beyond the Standard\nModel responsible for stabilisation of the electroweak vacuum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Jan 2013 02:33:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 Apr 2013 00:12:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

As in multiscale\nfinite element methods (MsFEMs), the main idea of the proposed approach is to\nconstruct a small dimensional local solution space that can be used to generate\nan efficient and accurate approximation to the multiscale solution with a\npotentially high dimensional input parameter space. In the proposed approach,\nwe present a general procedure to construct the offline space that is used for\na systematic enrichment of the coarse solution space in the online stage. The\nenrichment in the online stage is performed based on a spectral decomposition\nof the offline space. In the online stage, for any input parameter, a\nmultiscale space is constructed to solve the global problem on a coarse grid.\nThe online space is constructed via a spectral decomposition of the offline\nspace and by choosing the eigenvectors corresponding to the largest\neigenvalues. The computational saving is due to the fact that the construction\nof the online multiscale space for any input parameter is fast and this space\ncan be re-used for solving the forward problem with any forcing and boundary\ncondition. Compared with the other approaches where global snapshots are used,\nthe local approach that we present in this paper allows us to eliminate\nunnecessary degrees of freedom on a coarse-grid level. We present various\nexamples in the paper and some numerical results to demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Jan 2013 06:43:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 28 Apr 2013 12:31:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

We show that the current\ngeneration, with effective masses in the range of 100 kg and conceivable\nexposures in the range of 500 kg year, could already have a sizable opportunity\nto observe bb0nu events, and their combined discovery potential is quite large.\nThe next generation, with an exposure in the range of 10 ton year, would have a\nmuch more enhanced sensitivity, in particular due to the very low specific\nbackground that all the xenon technologies (liquid xenon, high-pressure xenon\nand xenon dissolved in liquid scintillator) can achieve. In addition, a\nhigh-pressure xenon gas TPC also features superb energy resolution. We show\nthat such detector can fully explore the range of allowed effective Majorana\nmasses, thus making a discovery very likely.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Jan 2013 09:58:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-01"}

A relativistic mixture of $r$\nconstituent is characterized by the moments of the distribution function:\nparticle four-flows, energy-momentum tensors and third-order moment tensors. By\nusing Eckart's decomposition and introducing $13r+1$ scalar fields -- related\nwith the four-velocity, temperature of the mixture, particle number densities,\ndiffusion fluxes, non-equilibrium pressures, heat fluxes and pressure deviator\ntensors -- Grad's distribution functions are obtained. Grad's distribution\nfunctions are used to determine the third-order tensors and their production\nterms for mixtures whose constituent's rest masses are not too disparate, so\nthat it follows a system of $13r+1$ scalar field equations. By restricting to a\nbinary mixture characterized by the six fields of partial particle number\ndensities, four-velocity and temperature, the remainder 21 scalar equations are\nused to determine the constitutive equations for the non-equilibrium pressures,\ndiffusion fluxes, pressure deviator tensors and heat fluxes.

Furthermore,\nsolutions of the relativistic field equations for the binary mixture are\nobtained in form of forced and free waves. In the low frequency limiting case\nthe phase velocity and the attenuation coefficient are determined for forced\nwaves.

The dust color emperature in the core calculated\nfrom Herschel maps ranges from roughly 10.7 to 14.0 K. This range agrees with\nthe previous determinations from Infrared Space Observatory and Planck\nobservations. The column density profile of the core can be fitted with a\nPlummer-like density distribution approaching n(r) ~ r^{-2} at large distances.\nThe core structure deviates clearly from a critical Bonnor-Ebert sphere.\nInstead, the core appears to be gravitationally bound and to lack thermal and\nturbulent support against the pressure of the surrounding low-density material:\nit may therefore be in the process of slow contraction.

It is\nproposed that the stellar and pulsar winds have to mix at some distance from\nthe binary system, defined by the orbital period of the companion stars and the\nvelocity of the stellar wind. The mixed pulsar-stellar wind expands with a\nspecific velocity determined by the pulsar power and the mass loss rate of the\ncompanion star. Relativistic particles, either from the inner pulsar\nmagnetosphere and/or accelerated at the shocks between stellar and pulsar\nwinds, are expected to be captured and isotropized in the reference frame of\nthe mixed wind. Therefore, they can efficiently comptonize stellar radiation\nproducing GeV-TeV $\\gamma$-rays in the inverse Compton process. We calculate\nthe $\\gamma$-ray spectra expected in such scenario for the two example binary\nsystems: J1816+4510 which is the redback type millisecond binary and LS 5039\nwhich is supposed to contain energetic pulsar.

The new notions are general characters of the communities or local\nstructures of networks. At first, we introduce the notions of internal\ndominating set and external dominating set of a community. We show that most\ncommunities in real networks have a small internal dominating set and a small\nexternal dominating set, and that the internal dominating set of a community\nkeeps much of the information of the community. Secondly, based on the notions\nof the internal dominating set and the external dominating set, we define an\ninternal slope (ISlope, for short) and an external slope (ESlope, for short) to\nmeasure the internal heterogeneity and external heterogeneity of a community\nrespectively. We show that the internal slope (ISlope) of a community largely\ndetermines the structure of the community, that most communities in real\nnetworks are heterogeneous, meaning that most of the communities have a\ncore/periphery structure, and that both ISlopes and ESlopes (reflecting the\nstructure of communities) of all the communities of a network approximately\nfollow a normal distribution. Therefore typical values of both ISolpes and\nESoples of all the communities of a given network are in a narrow interval, and\nthere is only a small number of communities having ISlopes or ESlopes out of\nthe range of typical values of the ISlopes and ESlopes of the network. Finally,\nwe show that all the communities of the real networks we studied, have a three\ndegree separation phenomenon, that is, the average distance of communities is\napproximately 3, implying a general property of true communities for many real\nnetworks, and that good community finding algorithms find communities that\namplify clustering coefficients of the networks, for many real networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Jan 2013 12:50:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-15"}

In such settings, Bayesian inference can be performed\nusing Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC). However, in spite of many recent\ndevelopments to ABC methodology, in many applications the computational cost of\nABC necessitates the choice of summary statistics and tolerances that can\npotentially severely bias the estimate of the posterior.\n  We propose a new \"piecewise\" ABC approach suitable for discretely observed\nMarkov models that involves writing the posterior density of the parameters as\na product of factors, each a function of only a subset of the data, and then\nusing ABC within each factor. The approach has the advantage of side-stepping\nthe need to choose a summary statistic and it enables a stringent tolerance to\nbe set, making the posterior \"less approximate\". We investigate two methods for\nestimating the posterior density based on ABC samples for each of the factors:\nthe first is to use a Gaussian approximation for each factor, and the second is\nto use a kernel density estimate. Both methods have their merits. The Gaussian\napproximation is simple, fast, and probably adequate for many applications. On\nthe other hand, using instead a kernel density estimate has the benefit of\nconsistently estimating the true ABC posterior as the number of ABC samples\ntends to infinity. We illustrate the piecewise ABC approach for three examples;\nin each case, the approach enables \"exact matching\" between simulations and\ndata and offers fast and accurate inference.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Jan 2013 13:53:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 May 2013 16:04:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-29"}

We\npropose that, in molecular clouds, the processes of freeze-out onto ice\nmantles, accumulation of radicals, explosion and then rapid (three-body)\ngas-phase chemistry occurs in a cyclic fashion. This can lead to a cumulative\nmolecular enrichment of the interstellar medium. A model of the time-dependent\nchemistries, based on this hypothesis, shows that significant abundances of\nlarge molecular species can be formed, although the complexity of the species\nis limited by the short expansion timescale in the gas, immediately following\nmantle explosion. We find that this mechanism may be an important source of\nsmaller organic species, such as methanol and formaldehyde, as well as\nprecursors to bio-molecule formation.

The recently suggested principle of maximum conformality (PMC)\nprovides a principle to eliminate such scale ambiguity in a step-by-step way.\nUsing the PMC, all non-conformal terms in perturbative expansion series are\nsummed into the running coupling, and one obtains a unique, scale-fixed,\nscheme-independent prediction at any finite order. In the paper, we make a\ndetailed PMC analysis for both the polarized and the unpolarized cross sections\nfor the double charmonium production process, $e^{+} + e^{-} \\to J/ \\psi\n(\\psi') + \\chi_{cJ}$ with $(J=0,1,2)$. The running behavior for the coupling\nconstant, governed by the PMC scales, are determined exactly for the specific\nprocesses. We compare our predictions with the measurements at the $B$\nfactories, BABAR and Belle, and the theoretical estimations obtained in the\nliterature. Because the non-conformal terms are different for various polarized\nand unpolarized cross sections, the PMC scales of these cross sections are\ndifferent in principle. It is found that all the PMC scales are almost\nindependent of the initial choice of renormalization scale. Thus, the large\nrenormalization scale uncertainty usually adopted in the literature up to\n$sim40%$ at the NLO level, obtained from the conventional scale setting, for\nboth the polarized and the unpolarized cross sections are greatly suppressed.\nIt is found that the charmonium production is dominated by J=0 channel.

However accurately determining the redshifts of the\nobserved galaxies without using spectroscopy is a major challenge.\nReconstruction of the redshifts with high resolution and well-understood\nuncertainties is mandatory for many science goals, including the study of\nbaryonic acoustic oscillations. We investigate different approaches to\nestablish the accuracy that can be reached by the LSST six-band photometry. We\nconstruct a realistic mock galaxy catalog, based on the GOODS survey luminosity\nfunction, by simulating the expected apparent magnitude distribution for the\nLSST. To reconstruct the photometric redshifts (photo-z's), we consider a\ntemplate-fitting method and a neural network method. The photo-z reconstruction\nfrom both of these techniques is tested on real CFHTLS data and also on\nsimulated catalogs. We describe a new method to improve photo-z reconstruction\nthat efficiently removes catastrophic outliers via a likelihood ratio\nstatistical test. This test uses the posterior probability functions of the fit\nparameters and the colors. We show that the photometric redshift accuracy will\nmeet the stringent LSST requirements up to redshift $\\sim2.5$ after a selection\nthat is based on the likelihood ratio test or on the apparent magnitude for\ngalaxies with $S/N>5$ in at least 5 bands. The former selection has the\nadvantage of retaining roughly 35% more galaxies for a similar photo-z\nperformance compared to the latter. Photo-z reconstruction using a neural\nnetwork algorithm is also described. In addition, we utilize the CFHTLS\nspectro-photometric catalog to outline the possibility of combining the neural\nnetwork and template-fitting methods. We conclude that the photo-z's will be\naccurately estimated with the LSST if a Bayesian prior probability and a\ncalibration sample are used.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Jan 2013 15:18:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 Oct 2013 15:26:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

If\nthe degree of the cover is odd, then Beineke, Brubaker and Frechette have\nconjectured that the $p$-power contributions to the Whittaker coefficients may\nbe computed using the theory of crystal graphs of type C, by attaching to each\npath component a Gauss sum or a degenerate Gauss sum depending on the fine\nstructure of the path. We establish their conjecture using a combination of\nautomorphic and combinatorial-representation-theoretic methods. Surprisingly,\nwe must make use of the type A theory, and the two different crystal graph\ndescriptions of Brubaker, Bump and Friedberg available for type A based on\ndifferent factorizations of the long word into simple reflections. We also\nestablish a formula for the Whittaker coefficients in the even degree cover\ncase, again based on crystal graphs of type C. As a further consequence, we\nestablish a Lie-theoretic description of the coefficients for $n$ sufficiently\nlarge, thereby confirming a conjecture of Brubaker, Bump and Friedberg.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Jan 2013 15:57:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 20 Apr 2013 23:15:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-18"}

We outline a semi-parametric, robust, parallel method for identifying\nvariability and isolated events at multiple scales in the presence of the above\ncomplications. This approach harnesses the power of Bayesian modeling while\nmaintaining much of the speed and scalability of more ad-hoc machine learning\napproaches.

The generalized Fokker-Planck\nequation with a non stationary diffusion has been derived and used for chaos\nanalysis. An anomalous transport turned out to be natural property of this\nequation. A nonlinear dispersion of the considered motion allowed to find a\nprincipal consequence: a chaotic system with uniform dynamic properties tends\nto unstable clustering. Small fluctuations of particles density increase by\ntime and form attractors and stochastic islands even if the initial transport\nproperties have uniform distribution. It was shown that an instability of phase\ntrajectories leads to the nonlinear dispersion law and consequently to a space\ninstability. A fixed boundary system was considered, using a standard\nFokker-Planck equation. We have derived that such a type of dynamic systems has\na discrete diffusive and energy spectra. It was shown that phase space\ndiffusion is the only parameter that defines a dynamic accuracy in this case.\nThe uncertainty relations have been obtained for conjugate phase space\nvariables with account of transport properties.
