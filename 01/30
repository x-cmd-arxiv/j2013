AK Sco consists of two F5 type stars that get as close as 11R$_*$\nat periastron passage. The presence of a dense\n  ($n_e \\sim 10^{11}$~cm$^{-3}$) extended envelope has been unveiled recently.\nIn this article, we report the results from a XMM-Newton based monitoring of\nthe system. We show that at periastron, X-ray and UV fluxes are enhanced\n  by a factor of $\\sim 3$ with respect to the apastron values. The X-ray\nradiation is produced in an optically thin plasma with T$\\sim 6.4\\times 10^{6}$\nK and it is found that the N$_H$ column density rises from 0.35$\\times\n10^{21}$~cm$^{-2}$ at periastron to 1.11$\\times 10^{21}$~cm$^{-2}$ at apastron,\nin good agreement with previous polarimetric observations. The UV emission\ndetected in the Optical Monitor band seems to be caused by the reprocessing of\nthe high energy magnetospheric radiation on the circumstellar material.\n  Further evidence of the strong magnetospheric disturbances is provided by the\ndetection of line broadening of 278.7~km~s$^{-1}$ in the N~V line with\nHST/STIS.\n  Numerical simulations of the mass flow from the circumbinary disk to the\ncomponents have been carried out. They provide a consistent scenario with which\nto interpret AK~Sco observations. We show that the eccentric orbit acts like a\ngravitational piston. At apastron, matter is dragged efficiently from the inner\ndisk border, filling the inner gap and producing accretion streams that end as\nring-like structures around each component of the system. At periastron, the\nring-like structures come into contact, leading to angular momentum loss, and\nthus producing an accretion outburst.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Jan 2013 16:12:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

However, if the graph dataset\ncontains sensitive data of individuals such as mobile phone-call graphs and\nweb-click graphs, releasing discovered frequent patterns may present a threat\nto the privacy of individuals. {\\em Differential privacy} has recently emerged\nas the {\\em de facto} standard for private data analysis due to its provable\nprivacy guarantee. In this paper we propose the first differentially private\nalgorithm for mining frequent graph patterns.\n  We first show that previous techniques on differentially private discovery of\nfrequent {\\em itemsets} cannot apply in mining frequent graph patterns due to\nthe inherent complexity of handling structural information in graphs. We then\naddress this challenge by proposing a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling\nbased algorithm. Unlike previous work on frequent itemset mining, our\ntechniques do not rely on the output of a non-private mining algorithm.\nInstead, we observe that both frequent graph pattern mining and the guarantee\nof differential privacy can be unified into an MCMC sampling framework. In\naddition, we establish the privacy and utility guarantee of our algorithm and\npropose an efficient neighboring pattern counting technique as well.\nExperimental results show that the proposed algorithm is able to output\nfrequent patterns with good precision.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Jan 2013 18:37:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 1 Mar 2013 21:43:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-05"}

Related simulations of\nthermalized hard disks indicate that the curves of pressure versus packing\nfraction for different polydispersities exhibit a sequence of transition\npoints, starting with a liquid-hexatic transition for the monodisperse case,\nand crossing over with increasing polydispersity to glassy, Ising-like critical\npoints.

An example of a free time minimizer defined on an unbounded\ninterval is a parabolic homothetic motion by a minimal central confguration.\nThe existence of a large amount of free time minimizers can be deduced from the\nweak KAM theorem. In particular, for any choice of x0, there should be at least\none free time minimizer x(t) defined for all positive time and satisfying\nx(0)=x0. We prove that such motions are completely parabolic.

Our work is enabled by high-resolution\nCANDELS images and accurate photometric redshifts, stellar masses and star\nformation rates (SFRs) from 37-band NMBS photometry. The total number of z>3\nmassive galaxies is consistent with the number of massive quiescent (MQ)\ngalaxies at z~2, implying that the SFRs for all of these galaxies must be much\nlower by z~2. We discover 4 CMQ galaxies at z>3, pushing back the time for\nwhich such galaxies have been observed. However, the volume density for these\ngalaxies is significantly less than that of galaxies at z<2 with similar\nmasses, SFRs, and sizes, implying that additional CMQ galaxies must be created\nin the ~1 Gyr between z=3 and z=2. We find 5 star-forming galaxies at z~3 that\nare compact (Re<1.4 kpc) and have stellar mass M*>10^(10.6)Msun, likely to\nbecome members of the CMQ galaxy population at z~2. We evolve the stellar\nmasses and SFRs of each individual z>3 galaxy adopting 5 different star\nformation histories (SFHs) and studying the resulting population of massive\ngalaxies at z=2.3. We find that declining or truncated SFHs are necessary to\nmatch the observed number density of MQ galaxies at z~2, whereas a constant SFH\nresults in a number density significantly smaller than observed. All of our\nassumed SFHs imply number densities of CMQ galaxies at z~2 that are consistent\nwith the observed number density. Better agreement with the observed number\ndensity of CMQ galaxies at z~2 is obtained if merging is included in the\nanalysis and better still if star formation quenching is assumed to shortly\nfollow the merging event, as implied by recent models of formation of MQ\ngalaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Jan 2013 21:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

Using a set of stellar population models with varying IMF\nslopes, we provide additional caveats on the assumption of a universal IMF. The\npresent study shows that the derived star formation histories of early-type\ngalaxies vary significantly with the IMF slope. For instance, a steepening in\nthe slope of a single power-law IMF decreases substantially, by a factor of up\nto four, the contribution of the old stellar populations to the total\nlight/mass. This trend is milder for a segmented-like IMF shape, where the\ncontribution of the very low mass stars is decreased. It is also shown that, by\ntuning each IMF slope to its prescribed value according to each galaxy velocity\ndispersion, a sample of early-type galaxies covering a range of masses yield\ncomparable star formation histories. On the one hand, a small contribution from\nrelatively young stellar populations appear in the star formation histories of\nmost massive elliptical galaxies when adopting a steep IMF. On the other hand,\nwe find that low mass early-type galaxies that look like genuinely young\nobjects with a standard IMF (i.e. ``baby elliptical galaxies``), turn out to be\nolder when a slightly flatter IMF is employed. In summary, the use of a\nnon-universal IMF, tuned according to the velocity dispersion of the galaxy,\nseems to provide more consistent results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Jan 2013 21:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

The multi-frequency observations were obtained using several\nground and space based facilities. The intense optical monitoring of the source\nreveals faster repetitive variations superimposed on a long-term variability\ntrend at a time scale of ~350 days. Episodes of fast variability recur on time\nscales of ~ 60-70 days. The intense and simultaneous activity at optical and\ngamma-ray frequencies favors the SSC mechanism for the production of the\nhigh-energy emission. Two major low-peaking radio flares were observed during\nthis high optical/gamma-ray activity period. The radio flares are characterized\nby a rising and a decaying stage and are in agreement with the formation of a\nshock and its evolution. We found that the evolution of the radio flares\nrequires a geometrical variation in addition to intrinsic variations of the\nsource. Different estimates yield a robust and self-consistent lower limits of\n\\delta > 20 and equipartition magnetic field B_eq > 0.36 G. Causality arguments\nconstrain the size of emission region \\theta < 0.004 mas. We found a\nsignificant correlation between flux variations at radio frequencies with those\nat optical and gamma-rays. The optical/GeV flux variations lead the radio\nvariability by ~65 days. The longer time delays between low-peaking radio\noutbursts and optical flares imply that optical flares are the precursors of\nradio ones. An orphan X-ray flare challenges the simple, one-zone emission\nmodels, rendering them too simple.

Extracting a common factor, we may harmlessly assume that the\nideal I=(h1,h2,h3)R has height two. Let phi be a homogeneous minimal\nHilbert-Burch matrix for the row vector [h1,h2,h3]. So, phi is a 3 by 2 matrix\nof homogeneous forms from R; the entries in column m have degree dm, with d1\n\\le d2 and d1+d2=d. The Rees algebra $cal R$ of I is the subring k[h1t,h2t,h3t]\nof the polynomial ring k[t]. The bi-projective spectrum of $cal R$ is the graph\nof the parameterization of C; and therefore, there is a dictionary which\ntranslates between the singularities of C and the algebra structure of $cal R$.\nThe ring $cal R$ is the quotient of the symmetric algebra Sym(I) by the ideal,\nA, of local cohomology with support in the homogeneous maximal ideal of R.

This task is known in the literature as rendezvous. Each agent has a\ndifferent label which is a positive integer known to it, but unknown to the\nother agent. Agents move in an asynchronous way: the speed of agents may vary\nand is controlled by an adversary. The cost of a rendezvous algorithm is the\ntotal number of edge traversals by both agents until their meeting. The only\nprevious deterministic algorithm solving this problem has cost exponential in\nthe size of the graph and in the larger label. In this paper we present a\ndeterministic rendezvous algorithm with cost polynomial in the size of the\ngraph and in the length of the smaller label. Hence we decrease the cost\nexponentially in the size of the graph and doubly exponentially in the labels\nof agents. As an application of our rendezvous algorithm we solve several\nfundamental problems involving teams of unknown size larger than 1 of labeled\nagents moving asynchronously in unknown networks. Among them are the following\nproblems: team size, in which every agent has to find the total number of\nagents, leader election, in which all agents have to output the label of a\nsingle agent, perfect renaming in which all agents have to adopt new different\nlabels from the set {1, . . . , k}, where k is the number of agents, and\ngossiping, in which each agent has initially a piece of information (value) and\nall agents have to output all the values.

This sample\nallows for characteristics of galaxies to be isolated (e.g. stellar mass and\ngroup halo mass), and their codependencies determined.\n  We observe that galaxy-galaxy interactions play the most important role in\nshaping the evolution within a group halo, the main role of halo mass is in\ngathering the galaxies together to encourage such interactions.

These distances make use of the unique combination of depth and\nspatial coverage of the Pan-Andromeda Archaeological Survey (PAndAS) to provide\na large, homogeneous sample consisting of 27 of M31's satellites, as well as\nM31 itself. We find that the satellite distribution, when viewed as a whole, is\nno more planar than one would expect from a random distribution of equal size.\nA disk consisting of 15 of the satellites is however found to be highly\nsignificant, and strikingly thin, with a root-mean-square thickness of just\n$12.34^{+0.75}_{-0.43}$ kpc. This disk is oriented approximately edge on with\nrespect to the Milky Way and almost perpendicular to the Milky Way disk. It is\nalso roughly orthogonal to the disk like structure regularly reported for the\nMilky Way satellite system and in close alignment with M31's Giant Stellar\nStream. A similar analysis of the asymmetry of the M31 satellite distribution\nfinds that it is also significantly larger than one would expect from a random\ndistribution. In particular, it is remarkable that 20 of the 27 satellites most\nlikely lie on the Milky Way side of the galaxy, with the asymmetry being most\npronounced within the satellite subset forming the aforementioned disk. This\nlopsidedness is all the more intriguing in light of the apparent orthogonality\nobserved between the satellite disk structures of the Milky Way and M31.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jan 2013 02:59:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

There are faster algorithms known\nfor several special cases: Cube-KMP (where all boxes are cubes), Unitcube-KMP\n(where all boxes are cubes of equal side length), Hypervolume (where all boxes\nshare a vertex), and k-Grounded (where the projection onto the first k\ndimensions is a Hypervolume instance).\n  In this paper we bring some order to these special cases by providing\nreductions among them.

We propose a simple test\nstatistic based on lasso fitted values, called the covariance test statistic,\nand show that when the true model is linear, this statistic has an\n$\\operatorname {Exp}(1)$ asymptotic distribution under the null hypothesis (the\nnull being that all truly active variables are contained in the current lasso\nmodel). Our proof of this result for the special case of the first predictor to\nenter the model (i.e., testing for a single significant predictor variable\nagainst the global null) requires only weak assumptions on the predictor matrix\n$X$. On the other hand, our proof for a general step in the lasso path places\nfurther technical assumptions on $X$ and the generative model, but still allows\nfor the important high-dimensional case $p>n$, and does not necessarily require\nthat the current lasso model achieves perfect recovery of the truly active\nvariables. Of course, for testing the significance of an additional variable\nbetween two nested linear models, one typically uses the chi-squared test,\ncomparing the drop in residual sum of squares (RSS) to a $\\chi^2_1$\ndistribution. But when this additional variable is not fixed, and has been\nchosen adaptively or greedily, this test is no longer appropriate: adaptivity\nmakes the drop in RSS stochastically much larger than $\\chi^2_1$ under the null\nhypothesis. Our analysis explicitly accounts for adaptivity, as it must, since\nthe lasso builds an adaptive sequence of linear models as the tuning parameter\n$\\lambda$ decreases. In this analysis, shrinkage plays a key role: though\nadditional variables are chosen adaptively, the coefficients of lasso active\nvariables are shrunken due to the $\\ell_1$ penalty. Therefore, the test\nstatistic (which is based on lasso fitted values) is in a sense balanced by\nthese two opposing properties - adaptivity and shrinkage - and its null\ndistribution is tractable and asymptotically $\\operatorname {Exp}(1)$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jan 2013 08:35:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 3 Mar 2013 21:07:34 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 26 May 2014 05:22:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-27"}

It was observed that neurons with short-term\nfacilitating synapses form predominantly reciprocal pairwise connections, while\nneurons with short-term depressing synapses form unidirectional pairwise\nconnections. The cause of these structural differences in synaptic\nmicrocircuits is unknown. We propose that these connectivity motifs emerge from\nthe interactions between short-term synaptic dynamics (SD) and long-term\nspike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP). While the impact of STDP on SD was\nshown in vitro, the mutual interactions between STDP and SD in large networks\nare still the subject of intense research. We formulate a computational model\nby combining SD and STDP, which captures faithfully short- and long-term\ndependence on both spike times and frequency. As a proof of concept, we\nsimulate recurrent networks of spiking neurons with random initial connection\nefficacies and where synapses are either all short-term facilitating or all\ndepressing. For identical background inputs, and as a direct consequence of\ninternally generated activity, we find that networks with depressing synapses\nevolve unidirectional connectivity motifs, while networks with facilitating\nsynapses evolve reciprocal connectivity motifs. This holds for heterogeneous\nnetworks including both facilitating and depressing synapses. Our study\nhighlights the conditions under which SD-STDP might the correlation between\nfacilitation and reciprocal connectivity motifs, as well as between depression\nand unidirectional motifs.

Despite the availability of established\nalgorithms, their efficient implementation for a specific robot still is a\ntedious and error-prone task. However, these components are simply necessary to\nget high performance controllers.\n  To achieve efficient yet well maintainable implementations of dynamics\nalgorithms we propose to use a domain specific language to describe the\nkinematics/dynamics model of a robot. Since the algorithms are parameterized on\nthis model, executable code tailored for a specific robot can be generated,\nthanks to the facilities available for \\dsls. This approach allows the users to\ndeal only with the high level description of their robot and relieves them from\nproblematic hand-crafted development; resources and efforts can then be focused\non open research questions.\n  Preliminary results about the generation of efficient code for inverse\ndynamics will be presented as a proof of concept of this approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jan 2013 10:40:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-31"}

Among others, a post-Asymptotic Giant Branch\n(post-AGB) origin is possible for a fraction of sdOs. We are involved in a\ncomprehensive ongoing study to search for and to analyze planetary nebulae\n(PNe) around sdOs with the aim of establishing the fraction and properties of\nsdOs with a post-AGB origin. We use deep Halpha and [OIII] images of sdOs to\ndetect nebular emission and intermediate resolution, long-slit optical\nspectroscopy of the detected nebulae and their sdO central stars. These data\nare complemented with other observations for further analysis of the detected\nnebulae. We report the detection of an extremely faint, complex PN around 2MASS\nJ19310888+4324577 (2M1931+4324), a star classified as sdO in a binary system.\nThe PN shows a bipolar and an elliptical shell, whose major axes are oriented\nperpendicular to each other, and high-excitation structures outside the two\nshells. WISE archive images show faint, extended emission at 12 and 22 microns\nin the inner nebular regions. The internal nebular kinematics is consistent\nwith a bipolar and a cylindrical/ellipsoidal shell, in both cases with the main\naxis mainly perpendicular to the line of sight. The nebular spectrum only\nexhibits Halpha, Hbeta and [OIII]4959,5007 emission lines, but suggests a very\nlow-excitation ([OIII]/Hbeta = 1.5), in strong contrast with the absence of\nlow-excitation emission lines. The spectrum of 2M1931+4324 presents narrow,\nionized helium absorptions that confirm the previous sdO classification and\nsuggest an effective temperature >= 60000 K. The binary nature of 2M1931+4324,\nits association with a complex PN, and several properties of the system provide\nstrong support for the idea that binary central stars are a crucial ingredient\nin the formation of complex PNe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jan 2013 12:48:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

In the\ncase of a stochastic system, these tasks typically involve the use of a belief\nstate- a probability distribution over the state of the process at a given\npoint in time. Unfortunately, the state spaces of complex processes are very\nlarge, making an explicit representation of a belief state intractable. Even in\ndynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs), where the process itself can be represented\ncompactly, the representation of the belief state is intractable. We\ninvestigate the idea of maintaining a compact approximation to the true belief\nstate, and analyze the conditions under which the errors due to the\napproximations taken over the lifetime of the process do not accumulate to make\nour answers completely irrelevant. We show that the error in a belief state\ncontracts exponentially as the process evolves. Thus, even with multiple\napproximations, the error in our process remains bounded indefinitely. We show\nhow the additional structure of a DBN can be used to design our approximation\nscheme, improving its performance significantly.

In this paper we propose a case-based approach to alleviating the\npreference elicitation bottleneck. Assuming the existence of a population of\nusers from whom we have elicited complete or incomplete preference structures,\nwe propose eliciting the preferences of a new user interactively and\nincrementally, using the closest existing preference structures as potential\ndefaults. Since a notion of closeness demands a measure of distance among\npreference structures, this paper takes the first step of studying various\ndistance measures over fully and partially specified preference structures.

To understand this, it is first shown that a gauge\ntransformation is not, in general, a unitary transformation. Also, physical\ninterpretations are based on both kinetic energy and potential energy\nexpressions. While the kinetic energy is a measurable quantity, and hence\ngauge-invariant, the potential energy is gauge-dependent. Two basic examples\nare examined; one classical and the other quantum-mechanical. The aim is to\nshow that the use of the Coulomb (or radiation) gauge is always consistent with\nthe way that fields are generated in the laboratory. Upon transformation out of\nthe Coulomb gauge, this connection is lost, and physical interpretations can\ngive rise to misleading inferences.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jan 2013 02:46:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-07"}

A theoretical\ninference of $h$, and a corresponding accounting for the physical origin of\n$h$, therefore needs be achieved in both respects.
