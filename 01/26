We include the impact of environmental events\n(rainfall, temperature and tidal range) on the epidemic in the Artibonite and\nOuest regions by introducing terms in the transmission rate that vary with\nenvironmental conditions. We fit the model on weekly data from the beginning of\nthe epidemic until December 2013, including the vaccination programs that were\nrecently undertaken in the Ouest and Artibonite regions. We then modified these\nprojections excluding vaccination to assess the programs' effectiveness. Using\nreal-time daily rainfall, we found lag times between precipitation events and\nnew cases that range from 3.4 to 8.4 weeks in Artibonite and 5.1 to 7.4 in\nOuest. In addition, it appears that, in the Ouest region, tidal influences play\na significant role in the dynamics of the disease. Intervention efforts of all\ntypes have reduced case numbers in both regions; however, persistent outbreaks\ncontinue. In Ouest, where the population at risk seems particularly besieged\nand the overall population is larger, vaccination efforts seem to be taking\nhold more slowly than in Artibonite, where a smaller core population was\nvaccinated. The models including the vaccination programs predicted that a year\nand six months later, the mean number of cases in Artibonite would be reduced\nby about two thousand cases, and in Ouest by twenty four hundred cases below\nthat predicted by the models without vaccination. We also found that\nvaccination is best when done in the early spring, and as early as possible in\nthe epidemic. Comparing vaccination between the first spring and the second,\nthere is a drop of about 40% in the case reduction due to the vaccine and about\n10% per year after that.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Jan 2013 17:00:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 21 Apr 2013 04:12:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 7 Jun 2013 03:03:40 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 13 Jun 2013 17:21:17 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 16 Sep 2014 21:16:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-18"}

This timescale was derived assuming perfect metal-silicate\nequilibration between the impactor and the target's mantle. However, in the\ncase of a small impactor most likely only a fraction of the target's mantle is\ninvolved in the equilibration, while only a small part of the impactor's core\nequilibrates in the case of a giant impact. We examined the effects of\nimperfect equilibration using results of high-resolution $N$-body simulations\nfor the oligarchic growth stage. These effects were found to be small as long\nas a planetary embryo has a deep liquid magma ocean during its accretion. The\neffect due to partial involvement of the target's mantle in equilibration is\nsmall due to the low metal-silicate partition coefficient for W suggested from\nthe low Hf/W ratio of the martian mantle.

For the parameter set $(n,k,d=k)$ with $n < 2k-1$, we\nconstruct a class of codes with an auxiliary parameter $w$, referred to as\ncanonical codes. With $w$ in the range $n-k < w < k$, these codes operate in\nthe region between the MSR point and the MBR point, and perform significantly\nbetter than the space-sharing line.

Very stringent bounds can be obtained from the cosmic ray\n(proton)--neutrino connection, assuming that the UHECRs escape as neutrons. In\nthis study, we identify three different regimes as a function of the fireball\nparameters: the standard \"one neutrino per cosmic ray\" case, the optically\nthick (to neutron escape) case, and the case where leakage of protons from the\nboundaries of the shells (direct escape) dominates. In the optically thick\nregime, photomeson production is very efficient, and more neutrinos will be\nemitted per cosmic ray than in the standard case, whereas in the direct\nescape-dominated regime, more cosmic rays than neutrinos will be emitted. We\ndemonstrate that, for efficient proton acceleration, which is required to\ndescribe the observed UHECR spectrum, the standard case only applies to a very\nnarrow region of the fireball parameter space. We illustrate with several\nobserved examples that conclusions on the cosmic ray--neutrino connection will\ndepend on the actual burst parameters. We show that the definition of the pion\nproduction efficiency currently used by the IceCube collaboration\nunderestimates the neutrino production in the optically thick case. Finally, we\npoint out that the direct escape component leads to a spectral break in the\ncosmic ray spectrum emitted from a single source.

The\nexact solution to the self-consistent-field equations in the thermodynamic\nlimit is obtained and the ground state is shown to exhibit antiferromagnetic\norder and incommensurate spin-density waves (SDW). At low interaction\nstrengths, the SDW has unidirectional character with a leading wave-vector\nalong the $<100>$-direction, and the system is metallic. As the interaction\nincreases, the system undergoes a simultaneous structural and\nmetal-to-insulator transition to a unidirectional SDW state along the\n$<111>$-direction, with a different wavelength. We systematically determine the\nreal- and momentum-space properties of these states.

We propose a computable outer\nbound valid for any memoryless channel. We first evaluate the sum-rate outer\nbound for the high- SNR linear deterministic approximation of the Gaussian\nnoise channel. This is shown to be capacity for the 3-user channel with\narbitrary channel gains and the sum-capacity for the symmetric K-user channel.\nInterestingly. for the K user channel having only the K th cognitive know all\nthe other messages is sufficient to achieve capacity i.e cognition at\ntransmitter 2 to K-1 is not needed. Next the sum capacity of the symmetric\nGaussian noise channel is characterized to within a constant additive and\nmultiplicative gap.

This new formalism\ntakes into account the fact that momentum conservation is not valid for\nrelativistic flows where the relativistic mass lost by radiation must be taken\ninto account, in contrast to the classic regime. We find analytic solutions for\nthe working surface velocity and radiated energy for the particular case of a\nstep function variability of the injection parameters. We model two cases: a\npulse of fast material and a pulse of slow material (with respect to the mean\nflow). Applying these models to gamma ray burst light curves, one can determine\nthe ratio of the Lorentz factors gamma_2 / gamma_1 and the ratio of the\nmass-loss rates dot{m_2} / dot{m_1} of the upstream and downstream flows.

We take a foundational approach, showing how knots are\nrelated not just to braiding and quantum operators, but to quantum set\ntheoretical foundations and algebras of fermions. We show how the operation of\nnegation in logic, seen as both a value and an operator, can generate the\nfusion algebra for a Majorana fermion, a particle that is its own anti-particle\nand interacts with itself either to annihilate itself or to produce itself. We\ncall negation in this mode the mark, as it operates on itself to change from\nmarked to unmarked states. The mark viewed recursively as a simplest discrete\ndynamical system naturally generates the fermion algebra, the quaternions and\nthe braid group representations related to Majorana fermions. The paper begins\nwith these fundmentals. They provide a conceptual key to many of the models\nthat appear later in the paper. In particular, the Fibonacci model for\ntopological quantum computing is seen to be based on the fusion rules for a\nMajorana fermion and these in turn are the interaction rules for the mark seen\nas a logical particle. It requires a shift in viewpoint to see that the\noperator of negation can also be seen as a logical value. The quaternions\nemerge naturally from the reentering mark. All these models have their roots in\nunitary representations of the Artin braid group to the quaternions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Jan 2013 06:56:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-29"}

The model shows the onset of convection\n(primary instability) in the form of two dimensional stationary rolls in the\nabsence of magnetic field, when the Rayleigh number $R$ is raised above a\ncritical value $R_c$. The flow becomes three dimensional at slightly higher\nvalues of Rayleigh number via wavy instability. These wavy rolls become chaotic\nfor slightly higher values of $R$ in low-Prandtl-number ($P_r$) fluids. A\nuniform magnetic field along horizontal plane strongly affects all kinds of\nconvective flows observed at higher values of $R$ in its absence. As the\nmagnetic field is raised above certain value, it orients the convective rolls\nin its own direction. Although the horizontal magnetic field does not change\nthe threshold for the primary instability, it affects the threshold for\nsecondary (wavy) instability. It inhibits the onset of wavy instability. The\ncritical Rayleigh number $R_o (Q,P_r)$ at the onset of wavy instability, which\ndepends on Chandrasekhar's number $Q$ and $P_r$, increases monotonically with\n$Q$ for a fixed value of $P_r$.

Does the hydrodynamic description exist also for waves in complex\nopen media? This is a long-standing fundamental problem in studies on wave\nlocalization. Practically, if it does exist, owing to its simplicity\nmacroscopic equations can be mastered far more easily than sophisticated\nmicroscopic theories of wave localization especially for experimentalists. The\npurposes of the present paper are two-fold. On the one hand, it is devoted to a\nreview of substantial recent progress in this subject. We show that in random\nopen media the wave energy density obeys a highly unconventional macroscopic\ndiffusion equation at scales much larger than the elastic mean free path. The\ndiffusion coefficient is inhomogeneous in space; most strikingly, as a function\nof the distance to the interface, it displays novel single parameter scaling\nwhich captures the impact of rare high-transmission states that dominate\nlong-time transport of localized waves. We review aspects of this novel\nmacroscopic diffusive phenomenon. On the other hand, it is devoted to a review\nof the supersymmetric field theory of light localization in open media. In\nparticular, we review its application in establishing a microscopic theory of\nthe aforementioned unconventional diffusive phenomenon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Jan 2013 09:02:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-29"}

The presence of a boundary causes an initially\ncircular patch of uniform vorticity to deform. Sufficiently far away from the\nboundary, the deformed shape is well approximated by an ellipse. This leading\norder elliptical deformation is investigated via the elliptic moment model of\nMelander, Zabusky & Styczek [M. V. Melander, N. J. Zabusky & A. S. Styczek, J.\nFluid. Mech., 167, 95 (1986)]. When the boundary is straight, the centre of the\nelliptic patch remains at a constant distance from the boundary, and the motion\nis integrable. Furthermore, since the straining flow acting on the patch is\nconstant in time, the problem is that of an elliptic vortex patch in constant\nstrain, which was analysed by Kida [S. Kida, J. Phys. Soc. Japan, 50, 3517\n(1981)]. For more complicated boundary shapes, such as a square corner, the\nmotion is no longer integrable. Instead, there is an adiabatic invariant for\nthe motion. This adiabatic invariant arises due to the separation in times\nscales between the relatively rapid time scale associated with the rotation of\nthe patch and the slower time scale associated with the self-advection of the\npatch along the boundary. The interaction of a vortex patch with a circular\nisland is also considered. Without a background flow, conservation of angular\nimpulse implies that the motion is again integrable. The addition of an\nirrotational flow past the island can drive the patch towards the boundary,\nleading to the possibility of large deformations and breakup.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Jan 2013 12:16:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-19"}

It depicts the\ndependency-based relationships between the assets of a game. For example, a\nplayer must construct an arsenal before he can build weapons. It is vital that\nthe dependency graph of a game is designed logically to ensure a logical\nsequence of game play. However, a mere logical dependency graph is not\nsufficient in sustaining the players' enduring interests in a game, which\nbrings the problem of game balancing into picture. The issue of game balancing\narises when the players do not feel the chances of winning the game over their\nAI opponents who are more skillful in the game play. At the current state of\nresearch, the architecture of dependency graph is monolithic for the players.\nThe sequence of asset possession is always foreseeable because there is only a\nsingle dependency graph. Game balancing is impossible when the assets of AI\nplayers are overwhelmingly outnumbering that of human players. This paper\nproposes a parallel architecture of dependency graph for the AI players and\nhuman players. Instead of having a single dependency graph, a parallel\narchitecture is proposed where the dependency graph of AI player is adjustable\nwith that of human player using a support dependency as a game balancing\nmechanism.

As an alternative submission system we\npropose an online advertising network called AdLeaks. AdLeaks leverages the\nubiquity of unsolicited online advertising to provide complete sender\nunobservability when submitting disclosures. AdLeaks ads compute a random\nfunction in a browser and submit the outcome to the AdLeaks infrastructure.\nSuch a whistleblower's browser replaces the output with encrypted information\nso that the transmission is indistinguishable from that of a regular browser.\nIts back-end design assures that AdLeaks must process only a fraction of the\nresulting traffic in order to receive disclosures with high probability. We\ndescribe the design of AdLeaks and evaluate its performance through analysis\nand experimentation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Jan 2013 15:42:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-29"}

In the simplest case of a laminar (non-turbulent)\ncore with the magnetic field aligned with the rotation axis, both analytic\nconsiderations and numerical simulations have shown that the formation of a\nlarge, $10^2\\au$-scale, rotationally supported protostellar disk is suppressed\nby magnetic braking in the ideal MHD limit for a realistic level of core\nmagnetization. This theoretical difficulty in forming protostellar disks is\ntermed \"magnetic braking catastrophe\". A possible resolution to this problem,\nproposed by \\citeauthor{HennebelleCiardi2009} and \\citeauthor{Joos+2012}, is\nthat misalignment between the magnetic field and rotation axis may weaken the\nmagnetic braking enough to enable disk formation. We evaluate this possibility\nquantitatively through numerical simulations. We confirm the basic result of\n\\citeauthor{Joos+2012} that the misalignment is indeed conducive to disk\nformation. In relatively weakly magnetized cores with dimensionless\nmass-to-flux ratio $\\gtrsim 5$, it enabled the formation of rotationally\nsupported disks that would otherwise be suppressed if the magnetic field and\nrotation axis are aligned. For more strongly magnetized cores, disk formation\nremains suppressed, however, even for the maximum tilt angle of $90\\degree$. If\ndense cores are as strongly magnetized as indicated by OH Zeeman observations\n(with a mean dimensionless mass-to-flux ratio $\\sim 2$), it would be difficult\nfor the misalignment alone to enable disk formation in the majority of them. We\nconclude that, while beneficial to disk formation, especially for the\nrelatively weak field case, the misalignment does not completely solve the\nproblem of catastrophic magnetic braking in general.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Jan 2013 20:25:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

Such a\nsystem has many practical advantages, such as the use of relatively simple,\nlow-cost and low-power transmitters, and in some cases, using the transmitters\nof opportunity, such as TV, radio stations. Additionally, ultra-narrowband CW\nsignals are suitable for motion estimation due to their ability to acquire high\nresolution Doppler information. In this paper, we present a novel synthetic\naperture imaging method for moving targets using a bi-static SAR system\ntransmitting ultra-narrowband continuous waveforms. Our method exploits the\nhigh Doppler resolution provided by ultra-narrowband CW signals to image both\nthe scene reflectivity and to determine the velocity of multiple moving\ntargets. Starting from the first principle, we develop a novel forward model\nbased on the temporal Doppler induced by the movement of antennas and moving\ntargets. We form the reflectivity image of the scene and estimate the motion\nparameters using a filtered-backprojection technique combined with a contrast\noptimization method. Analysis of the point spread function of our image\nformation method shows that reflectivity images are focused when the motion\nparameters are estimated correctly. We present analysis of the velocity\nresolution and the resolution of reconstructed reflectivity images. We analyze\nthe error between the correct and reconstructed position of targets due to\nerrors in velocity estimation. Extensive numerical simulations demonstrate the\nperformance of our method and validate the theoretical results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Jan 2013 07:56:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-22"}
