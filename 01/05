This method is particularly suitable for dealing with\ncomplex biological structures. One of the main features of the proposed\napproach is the simple and intuitive way of defining the setup and the photonic\nstructure to be simulated, which can be done by feeding the simulation with a\ndigital image of the structure. We also develop a set of techniques to process\nthe behavior of the evolving waves within the simulation. These techniques\ninclude a direction filter, that permits decoupling of waves travelling\nsimultaneously in different directions, a dynamic differential absorber, to\ncancel the waves reflected at the edges of the simulation space, a\nmulti-frequency excitation scheme based on a filter that allows decoupling\nwaves of different wavelengths travelling simultaneously, and a\nnear-to-far-field approach to evaluate the resulting wavefield outside the\nsimulation domain. We validate the code and, as an example, apply it to the\ncomplex structure found in a microorganism called Diachea leucopoda, which\nexhibits a multicolor iridescent appearance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Jan 2013 16:01:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-07"}

Many adjacent planets have orbital period ratios near\nresonant values, with a tendency to be larger than required for exact\nfirst-order mean-motion resonances. This intriguing feature has been shown to\nbe a natural outcome of orbital circularization of resonant planetary pairs due\nto star-planet tidal interactions. However, this feature holds in\nmulti-planetary systems with periods longer than ten days, for which tidal\ncircularization is unlikely to provide efficient divergent evolution of the\nplanets orbits. Gravitational interactions between planets and their parent\nprotoplanetary disk may instead provide efficient divergent evolution. For a\nplanet pair embedded in a disk, we show that interactions between a planet and\nthe wake of its companion can reverse convergent migration, and significantly\nincrease the period ratio from a near-resonant value. Divergent evolution due\nto wake-planet interactions is particularly efficient when at least one of the\nplanets opens a partial gap around its orbit. This mechanism could help account\nfor the diversity of period ratios in Kepler's multiple systems comprising\nsuper-Earth to sub-jovian planets with periods greater than about ten days.\nDiversity is also expected for planet pairs massive enough to merge their gap.\nThe efficiency of wake-planet interactions is then much reduced, but convergent\nmigration may stall with a variety of period ratios depending on the density\nstructure in the common gap. This is illustrated for the Kepler-46 system, for\nwhich we reproduce the period ratio of Kepler-46b and c.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Jan 2013 17:45:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 18 May 2013 14:32:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 29 Aug 2013 08:00:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

We confirm the\nexperimentally observed enhancement of the dilepton yield (normalized to the\nmultiplicity of neutral pions $N_{\\pi^0}$) in heavy-ion collisions with respect\nto that measured in $NN = (pp+pn)/2$ collisions. We identify two contributions\nto this enhancement: a) the $pN$ bremsstrahlung which scales with the number of\ncollisions and not with the number of participants, i.e. pions; b) the dilepton\nemission from intermediate $\\Delta$'s which are part of the reaction cycles\n$\\Delta \\to \\pi N ; \\pi N \\to \\Delta$ and $NN\\to N\\Delta; N\\Delta \\to NN$. With\nincreasing system size more generations of intermediate $\\Delta$'s are created.\nIf such $\\Delta$ decays into a pion, the pion can be reabsorbed, however, if it\ndecays into a dilepton, the dilepton escapes from the system. Thus,\nexperimentally one observes only one pion (from the last produced $\\Delta$)\nwhereas the dilepton yield accumulates the contributions from all $\\Delta$'s of\nthe cycle. We show as well that the Fermi motion enhances the production of\npions and dileptons in the same way.

When the electron and nuclear\nreservoirs are also assumed to be in strong thermal contact and the microwave\nirradiation saturates the target electron transition, the enhancement of the\nnuclear polarization is expected to be considerably high even if the\nirradiation frequency is set far away from the centre of the ESR line (as\nalready observed by Borghini) and the typical polarization time is reduced on\nmoving towards the boundaries of said line. More reasonable behaviours are\nobtained by reducing the level of microwave saturation or the contact between\nelectrons and nuclei in presence of nuclear leakage. In both cases the function\ndescribing the dependency of the steady state nuclear polarization on the\nfrequency of irradiation becomes sharper at the edges and the build up rate\ndecreases on moving off-resonance.

Additionally, in many real-world\nsituations it is reasonable to include node weights into complex network\nstatistics to reflect the varying size or importance of subsystems that are\nrepresented by nodes in the network of interest. E.g., nodes can represent\nvastly different surface area in climate networks, volume in brain networks or\neconomic capacity in trade networks.

A subsample of 48 clusters within the 270 square degree region\noverlapping SDSS Stripe 82 is estimated to be 90% complete for M_500c > 4.5e14\nMsun and 0.15 < z < 0.8. While matched filters are used to detect the clusters,\nthe sample is studied further through a \"Profile Based Amplitude Analysis\"\nusing a single filter at a fixed \\theta_500 = 5.9' angular scale.

The new method, called partitioned correlation function interaction\n(PCFI), converges rapidly and gives total energies that are lower than the\nordinary ones (MCHF and CI).

This dispersion is associated with the continuous\nspectrum of the underlying differential operator and the absence of discrete\neigenvalues. The introduction of spatially localized perturbations in a\nperiodic medium leads to defect modes, states in which energy remains trapped\nand spatially localized. In this paper we study weak, localized perturbations\nof one-dimensional periodic Schr\\\"odinger operators. Such perturbations give\nrise to such defect modes, and are associated with the emergence of discrete\neigenvalues from the continuous spectrum. Since these isolated eigenvalues are\nlocated near a spectral band edge, there is strong scale-separation between the\nmedium period and the localization length of the defect mode. Bound states\ntherefore have a multi-scale structure: a \"carrier Bloch wave\" times a \"wave\nenvelope\", which is governed by a homogenized Schr\\\"odinger operator with\nassociated effective mass, depending on the spectral band edge which is the\nsite of the bifurcation. Our analysis is based on a reformulation of the\neigenvalue problem in Bloch quasi-momentum space, using the Gelfand-Bloch\ntransform and a Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction to a closed equation for the\nnear-band-edge frequency components of the bound state. A rescaling of the\nlatter equation yields the homogenized effective equation for the wave\nenvelope, and approximations to bifurcating eigenvalues and eigenfunctions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Jan 2013 21:33:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Jul 2014 13:04:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-01"}

We study mergers of systems from SMC-like dwarfs and Milky\nWay analogues to z~2 starburst disks. Multi-phase super-winds are generated in\nall passages, with outflow rates up to ~1000 M_sun/yr. However, the wind\nmass-loading efficiency (outflow rate divided by SFR) is similar to that in\nisolated galaxy counterparts of each merger: it depends more on global galaxy\nproperties (mass, size, escape velocity) than on the dynamical state of the\nmerger. Winds tend to be bi- or uni-polar, but multiple 'events' build up\ncomplex morphologies with overlapping, differently-oriented bubbles/shells at a\nrange of radii. The winds have complex velocity and phase structure, with\nmaterial at a range of speeds up to ~1000 km/s, and a mix of molecular,\nionized, and hot gas that depends on galaxy properties and different feedback\nmechanisms. These simulations resolve a problem in some 'sub-grid' models,\nwhere simple wind prescriptions can dramatically suppress merger-induced\nstarbursts. But despite large mass-loading factors (>~10) in the winds, the\npeak SFRs are comparable to those in 'no wind' simulations.

Previous research\nhas provided the scaling of a lower bound of the ATT for random walks in\ngeneral networks with a deep trap. However, it is still not well understood in\nwhich networks this minimal scaling can be reached. Particularly, explicit\nquantitative results for ATT in such networks, even in a specific network, are\nlacking, in spite that such networks shed light on the design for optimal\nnetworks with the highest trapping efficiency. In this paper, we study the\ntrapping problem taking place on a hierarchical scale-free network with a\nperfect trap. We focus on four representative cases with the immobile trap\nlocated at the root, a peripheral node, a neighbor of the root with a single\nconnectivity, and a farthest node from the root, respectively. For all the four\ncases, we obtain the closed-form formulas for the ATT, as well as its leading\nscalings. We show that for all the four cases of trapping problems, the\ndominating scalings of ATT can reach the predicted minimum scalings.

The biggest challenge in MANETs is to find a path between\ncommunicating nodes, which is the MANET routing problem. Biology-inspired\ntechniques such as ant colony optimisation (ACO) which have proven to be very\nadaptable in other problem domains, have been applied to the MANET routing\nproblem as it forms a good fit to the problem. The general characteristics of\nthese biological systems, which include their capability for self-organisation,\nself-healing and local decision making, make them suitable for routing in\nMANETs. In this paper, we discuss a few ACO based protocols, namely AntNet,\nhybrid ACO (AntHocNet), ACO based routing algorithm (ARA), imProved ant colony\noptimisation routing algorithm for mobile ad hoc NETworks (PACONET), ACO based\non demand distance vector (Ant-AODV) and ACO based dynamic source routing\n(Ant-DSR), and determine their performance in terms of quality of service (QoS)\nparameters, such as end-to-end delay and packet delivery ratio, using Network\nSimulator 2 (NS2). We also compare them with well known protocols, ad hoc on\ndemand distance vector (AODV) and dynamic source routing (DSR), based on the\nrandom waypoint mobility model. The simulation results show how this\nbiology-inspired approach helps in improving QoS parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Jan 2013 09:44:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-08"}

However this is limited to the short time of the onset transition. In\nreal plasma however there is random generation and suppression of convection\ncells and the sequence of these transient events can prove able to sustain the\neffect on the toroidal rotation.

V2492 Cyg is a young eruptive star that went into outburst in 2010.\nThe near-infrared color changes observed since the outburst peak suggest that\nthe source belongs to a newly defined sub-class of young eruptive stars, where\ntime-dependent accretion and variable line-of-sight extinction play a combined\nrole in the flux changes.\n  Aims. In order to learn about the origin of the light variations and to\nexplore the circumstellar and interstellar environment of V2492 Cyg, we\nmonitored the source at ten different wavelengths, between 0.55 \\mu m and 2.2\n\\mu m from the ground and between 3.6 \\mu m and 160 \\mu m from space.\n  Methods. We analyze the light curves and study the color-color diagrams via\ncomparison with the standard reddening path. We examine the structure of the\nmolecular cloud hosting V2492 Cyg by computing temperature and optical depth\nmaps from the far-infrared data.\n  Results. We find that the shapes of the light curves at different wavelengths\nare strictly self-similar and that the observed variability is related to a\nsingle physical process, most likely variable extinction. We suggest that the\ncentral source is episodically occulted by a dense dust cloud in the inner\ndisk, and, based on the invariability of the far-infrared fluxes, we propose\nthat it is a long-lived rather than a transient structure. In some respects,\nV2492 Cyg can be regarded as a young, embedded analog of UX Orionis-type stars.\n  Conclusions. The example of V2492 Cyg demonstrates that the light variations\nof young eruptive stars are not exclusively related to changing accretion. The\nvariability provided information on an azimuthally asymmetric structural\nelement in the inner disk. Such an asymmetric density distribution in the\nterrestrial zone may also have consequences for the initial conditions of\nplanet formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Jan 2013 12:42:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 1 Feb 2013 18:13:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

The\npopular matchings problem can be defined as follows: Let G = (A U P, E) be a\nbipartite graph where A denotes a set of agents, P denotes a set of posts and\nthe edges in E are ranked. Each agent ranks a subset of posts in an order of\npreference, possibly involving ties. A matching M is popular if there exists no\nmatching M' such that the number of agents that prefer M' to M exceeds the\nnumber of agents that prefer M to M'. Consider a centralized market where\nagents submit their preferences and a central authority matches agents to posts\naccording to the notion of popularity. Since a popular matching need not be\nunique, we assume that the central authority chooses an arbitrary popular\nmatching. Let a1 be the sole manipulative agent who is aware of the true\npreference lists of all other agents. The goal of a1 is to falsify her\npreference list to get better always, that is, to improve the set of posts that\nshe gets matched to as opposed to what she got when she was truthful. We show\nthat the optimal cheating strategy for a single agent to get better always can\nbe computed in O(\\sqrt{n}m) time when preference lists are allowed to contain\nties and in O(m+n) time when preference lists are all strict. Here n = |A| +\n|P| and m = |E|.\n  To compute the cheating strategies, we develop a switching graph\ncharacterization of the popular matchings problem involving ties.

This opens a possibility to consider\nKaluza-Klein models with a noncompact extra dimension that remains invisible\nfor a macroscopic observer.

The study is conducted using the stochastic\ntime-dependent Ginzburg--Landau model, and the results are compared with the\nKibble--Zurek mechanism (KZM). The assumptions of KZM are formulated and\nchecked as three separate postulates. We find a characteristic length and\ncharacteristic times for the processes we study. Besides the case of uniform\nrings, we examined the case of rings with several weak links. For temperatures\nclose or below $T_c$, the coherence length does not characterize the\ncorrelation length. In order to regard the winding number as a conserved\nquantity, it is necessary to allow for a short lapse of time during which\nunstable configurations decay. We found criteria for the validity of the 1D\ntreatment. The is no lower bound for final temperatures that permit 1D\ntreatment. For moderate quenching times $\\tau_Q$, the variance of the winding\nnumber obeys the scaling $< n^2>\\propto \\tau_Q^{-1/4}$, as predicted by KZM in\nthe case of mean field models; for $\\tau_Q\\alt 10^5\\hbar /k_BT_c$, the\ndependence is weaker.

Where are we going? Are we alone in the\nuniverse? What is good and what is evil? The scientific narrative of cosmic\nevolution demands that we tackle such big questions with a cosmological\nperspective. I tackle the first question in Chapters 4-6; the second in\nChapters 7-8; the third in Chapter 9 and the fourth in Chapter 10. However,\nwhere do we start to answer such questions? In Chapters 1-3, I elaborate the\nconcept of worldview and argue that we should aim at constructing comprehensive\nand coherent worldviews. In Chapter 4, I identify seven fundamental challenges\nto any ultimate explanation. I conclude that our explanations tend to fall in\ntwo cognitive attractors, the point or the cycle. In Chapter 5, I focus on the\nfree parameters issue, while Chapter 6 is a critical analysis of the\nfine-tuning issue. I conclude that fine-tuning is a conjecture and that we need\nto further study how typical our universe is. This opens a research endeavor\nthat I call artificial cosmogenesis. In Chapter 7, I show the importance of\nartificial cosmogenesis from extrapolating the future of scientific\nsimulations. I then analyze two other evolutionary explanations of fine-tuning\nin Chapter 8: Cosmological Natural Selection and the broader scenario of\nCosmological Artificial Selection. In Chapter 9, I inquire into the search for\nextraterrestrials and conclude that some binary star systems are good\ncandidates. Since those putative beings feed on stars, I call them starivores.\nThe question of their artificiality remains open, but I propose a prize to\nfurther continue and motivate the scientific assessment of this hypothesis. In\nChapter 10, I explore foundations to build a cosmological ethics and conclude\nthat the ultimate good is the infinite continuation of the evolutionary\nprocess.
