The model is obtained by\nusing the framework of interacting particle systems to extend a stochastic\ntwo-patch model that has been recently introduced by Kang and the author. The\nmain objective is to understand the effect of the geometry of the network of\ninteractions, which represents potential migrations between patches, on the\nlong-term behavior of the metapopulation. In the limit as the number of patches\ntends to infinity, there is a critical value for the Allee threshold below\nwhich the metapopulation expands and above which the metapopulation goes\nextinct. Spatial simulations on large regular graphs suggest that this critical\nvalue strongly depends on the initial distribution when the degree of the\nnetwork is large whereas the critical value does not depend on the initial\ndistribution when the degree is small. Looking at the system starting with a\nsingle occupied patch on the complete graph and on the ring, we prove\nanalytical results that support this conjecture. From an ecological\nperspective, these results indicate that, upon arrival of an alien species\nsubject to a strong Allee effect to a new area, though dispersal is necessary\nfor its expansion, strong long range dispersal drives the population toward\nextinction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Jan 2013 19:46:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-03"}

The surface\nequations are similar to the Cauchy's equations for the volume, but involve a\nspecial definition of the 'divergence' (tensorial product of the covariant\nderivatives on the surface and the whole space). The normal component of the\ndivergence equation generalizes the Laplace's equation for a fluid-fluid\ninterface. Assuming that Green's formula remains valid at the contact line\n(despite the singularity), two equations are obtained at this line. The first\none expresses that the fluid-fluid surface tension is equilibrated by the two\nsurface stresses (and not by the volume stresses of the body) and suggests a\nfinite displacement at this line (contrary to the infinite-displacement\nsolution of classical elasticity, in which the surface properties are not taken\ninto account). The second equation represents a strong modification of Young's\ncapillary equation. The validity of Green's formula and the existence of a\nfinite-displacement solution are justified with an explicit example of\nfinite-displacement solution in the simple case of a half-space elastic solid\nbounded by a plane. The solution satisfies the contact line equations and its\nelastic energy is finite (whereas it is infinite for the classical elastic\nsolution). The strain tensor components generally have different limits when\napproaching the contact line under different directions. Although Green's\nformula cannot be directly applied, because the stress tensor components do not\nbelong to the Sobolev space H1(V), it is shown that this formula remains valid.\nAs a consequence, there is no contribution of the volume stresses at the\ncontact line.

This new perspective is\nmore appropriate to define stochastic spatial processes in which large blocks\nof vertices may flip simultaneously, which is then applied to define a spatial\nversion of the Galam's majority rule model. In our spatial model, each vertex\nof the lattice has one of two possible competing opinions, say opinion 0 and\nopinion 1, as in the popular voter model. Hyperedges are updated at rate one,\nwhich results in all the vertices in the hyperedge changing simultaneously\ntheir opinion to the majority opinion of the hyperedge. In the case of a tie in\nhyperedges with even size, a bias is introduced in favor of type 1, which is\nmotivated by the principle of social inertia. Our analytical results along with\nsimulations and heuristic arguments suggest that, in any spatial dimensions and\nwhen the set of hyperedges consists of the collection of all n x ... x n blocks\nof the lattice, opinion 1 wins when n is even while the system clusters when n\nis odd, which contrasts with results about the voter model in high dimensions\nfor which opinions coexist.

Then, the assumption is relaxed to the case where the\nerror vectors in the channel estimates are assumed to lie in an uncertainty set\nformed by the intersection of finite ellipsoids. As our main contributions, we\npresent two procedures to solve the intractable nonconvex robust designs based\non the worst case principle. The proposed iterative algorithms solve the\nsemidefinite programs in each of their steps and provably converge to a locally\noptimal solution of the robust WSRM problem. The proposed approaches are\nnumerically compared against each other to ascertain their robustness towards\nchannel estimation imperfections. The results clearly indicate the performance\ngain compared to the case when channel uncertainties are ignored in the design\nprocess. For certain scenarios, we also quantify the gap between the proposed\napproximations and exact solutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Jan 2013 07:08:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-21"}

We define a space L_K(M) of framed flat\nconnections on the boundary of M that extend to M. Our goal is to understand an\nopen part of L_K(M) as a Lagrangian in the symplectic space of framed flat\nconnections on the boundary, and as a K_2-Lagrangian, meaning that the\nK_2-avatar of the symplectic form restricts to zero. We construct an open part\nof L_K(M) from data assigned to a hypersimplicial K-decomposition of an ideal\ntriangulation of M, generalizing Thurston's gluing equations in 3d hyperbolic\ngeometry, and combining them with the cluster coordinates for framed flat\nPGL(K)-connections on surfaces. Using a canonical map from the complex of\nconfigurations of decorated flags to the Bloch complex, we prove that any\ngeneric component of L_K(M) is K_2-isotropic if the boundary satisfies some\ntopological constraints (Theorem 4.2). In some cases this implies that L_K(M)\nis K_2-Lagrangian. For general M, we extend a classic result of Neumann-Zagier\non symplectic properties of PGL(2) gluing equations to reduce the\nK_2-Lagrangian property to a combinatorial claim.\n  Physically, we use the symplectic properties of K-decompositions to construct\n3d N=2 superconformal field theories T_K[M] corresponding (conjecturally) to\nthe compactification of K M5-branes on M. This extends known constructions for\nK=2. Just as for K=2, the theories T_K[M] are described as IR fixed points of\nabelian Chern-Simons-matter theories. Changes of triangulation (2-3 moves) lead\nto abelian mirror symmetries that are all generated by the elementary duality\nbetween N_f=1 SQED and the XYZ model.

Since the\nsolar wind is absorbed by the body, a wake is created behind the object. This\nwake is gradually filled by solar wind plasma downstream of the body, through\nthermal expansion and the resulting ambipolar electric field, along the\nmagnetic field lines. Here we study this plasma expansion into a vacuum using a\nhybrid plasma solver. In the hybrid approximation, ions are treated as\nparticles, and electrons as a massless fluid. We also derive corresponding one-\nand two-dimensional model problems that account for the absorbing obstacle. It\nis found that the absorbing obstacle create ion velocity distributions that are\nfar from the assumed upstream thermal Maxwellian distributions. Such\ndistributions can give rise to different plasma instabilities that has been\nobserved in the Lunar wake.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Jan 2013 10:04:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-03"}

The search for\natmospheric signatures to establish planetary habitability and the presence of\nlife might be possible in the future. We want to quantify the accuracy of\nretrieved atmospheric parameters which might be obtained from infrared emission\nspectroscopy. We use synthetic observations of hypothetical habitable planets,\nconstructed with a parametrized atmosphere model, a high-resolution radiative\ntransfer model and a simplified noise model. Classic statistical tools such as\nchi2 statistics and least-square fits were used to analyze the simulated\nobservations. When adopting the design of currently planned or proposed\nexoplanet characterization missions, we find that emission spectroscopy could\nprovide weak limits on surface conditions of terrestrial planets, hence their\npotential habitability. However, these mission designs are unlikely to allow to\ncharacterize the composition of the atmosphere of a habitable planet, even\nthough CO2 is detected. Upon increasing the signal-to-noise ratios by about a\nfactor of 2-5 (depending on spectral resolution) compared to current mission\ndesigns, the CO2 content could be characterized to within two orders of\nmagnitude.

In literature, massive cores such as this one are often referred to as\n\"super-Jeans cores\". As starless cores are perhaps on the cusp of forming\nstars, a study of their dynamics will improve our understanding of the\ntransition from the prestellar to the protostellar phase. In the present work\nwe use non-magnetic polytropes belonging originally to the family of the\nIsothermal sphere. For the purpose, perturbations were applied to individual\npolytropes, first by replacing the isothermal gas with a gas that was cold near\nthe centre of the polytrope and relatively warm in the outer regions, and\nsecond, through a slight compression of the polytrope by raising the external\nconfining pressure. Using this latter configuration we identify thermodynamic\nconditions under which a core is likely to remain starless. In fact, we also\nargue that the attribute \"super-Jeans\" is subjective and that these cores do\nnot formally violate the Jeans stability criterion. On the basis of our test\nresults we suggest that gas temperature in a star-forming cloud is crucial\ntowards the formation and evolution of a core. Simulations in this work were\nperformed using the particle-based Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics algorithm.\nHowever, to establish numerical convergence of the results we suggest similar\ntests with a grid-scheme, such as the Adaptive mesh refinement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Jan 2013 14:28:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-03"}
