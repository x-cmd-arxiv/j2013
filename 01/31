Slipher had singlehandedly established a tendency for 'spiral\nnebulae' to be redshifted (21 out of 25 cases). From a modern perspective, it\ncould seem surprising that the expansion of the universe was not announced at\nthis point. Examination of Slipher's papers shows that he reached a more subtle\nconclusion: the identification of cosmological peculiar velocities, including\nthe bulk motion of the Milky Way, leading to a beautiful argument in favour of\nnebulae as distant stellar systems. Nevertheless, Slipher's data actually\ncontain evidence at >8sigma for a positive mean velocity, even after\nsubtracting the dipole owing to the motion of the observer. In 1929, Hubble\nestimated distances for a sample of no greater depth, using redshifts due\nalmost entirely to Slipher. Hubble's distances were flawed in two distinct\nways: in addition to an incorrect absolute calibration, the largest distances\nwere systematically under-estimated. Nevertheless, he claimed the detection of\na linear distance-redshift relation. Statistically, the evidence for such a\ncorrelation is less strong than the simple evidence for a positive mean\nvelocity in Hubble's sample. Comparison with modern data shows that a sample of\nmore than twice Hubble's depth would generally be required in order to reveal\nclearly the global linear expansion in the face of the 'noise' from peculiar\nvelocities. When the theoretical context of the time is examined, the role of\nthe de Sitter model and its prediction of a linear distance-redshift relation\nlooms large. A number of searches for this relation were performed prior to\nHubble over the period 1924-1928, with a similar degree of success. All were\nbased on the velocities measured by Slipher, whose work from a Century ago\nstands out both for the precision of his measurements and for the subtle\nclarity of the arguments he employed to draw correct conclusions from them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jan 2013 16:59:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-31"}

An important parameter is the height of magnetic\nreconnection. When magnetic reconnection takes place near the photosphere, the\nreconnection out- flow collides with the region where the plasma beta is much\nlarger than unity. Then the plasma moves along a magnetic field. This motion\ngenerates a slow mode wave. The slow mode wave develops to a strong slow shock\nas it propagates upward. When the slow shock crosses the transition region, the\ntransition region is lifted up. As a result, we obtain a chromospheric jet as\nthe lifted transition region.

We provide a scientific foundation to inform this debate, based on\nmathematical, epidemiological models that quantify the dependence of\nfirearm-related death rates of people on gun policies. We assume a shooter\nattacking a single individual or a crowd. Two strategies can minimize deaths in\nthe model, depending on parameters: either a ban of private firearms\npossession, or a policy allowing the general population to carry guns. In\nparticular, the outcome depends on the fraction of offenders that illegally\npossess a gun, on the degree of protection provided by gun ownership, and on\nthe fraction of the population who take up their right to own a gun and carry\nit with them when attacked, parameters that can be estimated from statistical\ndata. With the measured parameters, the model suggests that if the gun law is\nenforced at a level similar to that in the United Kingdom, gun-related deaths\nare minimized if private possession of firearms is banned. If such a policy is\nnot practical or possible due to constitutional or cultural constraints, the\nmodel and parameter estimation indicate that a partial reduction in firearm\navailability can lead to a reduction in gun-induced death rates, even if they\nare not minimized. Most importantly, our analysis identifies the crucial\nparameters that determine which policy reduces the death rates, providing\nguidance for future statistical studies that will be necessary for more refined\nquantitative predictions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jan 2013 19:19:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 1 Feb 2013 00:07:38 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 11 Feb 2013 18:04:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-12"}

These\nissues mainly arise from the growth of nanowires under conditions different\nfrom those used for thin films or bulk GaAs, such as the co-existence of\nzincblende and wurtzite polytypes, the use of gold particles as catalyst, and\nthe arsenic-limited growth regime. Hence, we carry out density-functional\ncalculations for As vacancies, Ga_As antisites, and Au impurities in ZB and WZ\nGaAs crystals. Our results show that As vacancies can diffuse within in a ZB\nGaAs crystal with migration barriers of ~1.9 eV. Within WZ GaAs, As vacancy\ndiffusion is found to be anisotropic, with low barriers of 1.60 up to 1.79 eV\n(depending on doping conditions) in the ab-plane, while there are higher\nbarriers of 2.07 to 2.44 eV to diffuse along the c-axis. The formation energy\nof Au impurities is found to be generally much lower than those of arsenic\nvacancies or Ga_As antisites. Thus, Au impurities will be the dominant defects\nformed in Au-catalyzed nanowire growth. Moreover, we find that it is\nenergetically more favorable by 1 to 2 eV for an Au impurity to replace a\nlattice Ga atom than a lattice As atom in GaAs. An Au substitutional defect for\na lattice Ga atom in ZB GaAs is found to create a charge transfer level in the\nlower half of the band gap. While our calculations locate this level at E_v +\n0.22eV, taking into account the inaccuracy of the density functional that ought\nto be corrected by a downshift of E_v by about 0.2eV results in good agreement\nwith the experimental result of E_v + 0.4eV.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jan 2013 19:44:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-02"}

Directly studying the accretion at the earliest\nphases of stellar growth is challenging because young stars are deeply embedded\nin optically thick envelopes, which have spectral energy distributions that\npeak in the far-IR, where observations are difficult. In this paper, we\nconsider the feasibility of detecting accretion outbursts from these younger\nstars by investigating the timescales for how the protostellar envelope\nresponds to changes in the emission properties of the central source. The\nenvelope heats up in response to an outburst, brightening at all wavelengths\nand with the emission peak moving to shorter wavelengths. The timescale for\nthis change depends on the time for dust grains to heat and re-emit photons and\nthe time required for the energy to escape the inner, optically-thick portion\nof the envelope. We find that the dust response time is much shorter than the\nphoton propagation time and thus the timescale over which the emission varies\nis set by time delays imposed by geometry. These times are hours to days near\nthe peak of the spectral energy distribution and weeks to months in the sub-mm.\nThe ideal location to quickly detect continuum variability is therefore in the\nmid- to far-IR, near the peak of the spectral energy distribution, where the\nchange in emission amplitude is largest. Searching for variability in sub-mm\ncontinuum emission is also feasible, though with a longer time separation and a\nweaker relationship between the amount of detected emission amplitude and\nchange in central source luminosity. Such observations would constrain\naccretion histories of protostars and would help to trace the disk/envelope\ninstabilities that lead to stellar growth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jan 2013 19:50:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

Separately, recent experiments in fluid mechanics have demonstrated\nthe emergence of a full range of quantum phenomena from completely classical\nmotion. We present two specific hypotheses. First, Kuramoto theory may give a\nbasis for geometrical thinking about entanglement. Second, we consider a recent\nsoliton model of the electron, in which the quantum-mechanical wave function is\na phase modulation of a carrier wave. Both models are consistent with one\nanother and with observation. Both models suggest how entanglement and\ndecoherence may be related to device geometry. Both models predict that it will\nbe difficult to maintain phase coherence of more than three qubits in the\nplane, or four qubits in a three-dimensional structure. The soliton model also\nshows that the experimental work which appeared to demonstrate a violation of\nBell's inequalities might not actually do so; regardless of whether it is a\ncorrect description of the world, it exposes a flaw in the logic of the Bell\ntests. Thus the case for the security of EPR-based quantum cryptography has\njust not been made. We propose experiments in quantum computation to test this.\nFinally, we examine two possible interpretations of such soliton models: one is\nconsistent with the transactional interpretation of quantum mechanics, while\nthe other is an entirely classical model in which we do not have to abandon the\nidea of a single world where action is local and causal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jan 2013 20:35:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-31"}

The alternative picture was either reconnection due to the\nstochasticity of magnetic field lines in turbulence or the tearing instability\nof the thin current sheet.

The late-time evolution resembles generic turbulence\nwith -5/3 power spectrum and scale-dependent anisotropy, so I conclude that the\ntearing-driven reconnection becomes turbulent reconnection. The turbulence is\nlocal in scale, so microscopic diffusivity should not affect large-scale\nquantities.

We have extrapolated and adapted this\napproach to simulations of Milky Way-sized galaxy mergers containing black\nholes and explored the impact of the various parameters in this model as well\nas its resolution dependence. The two key parameters in the model are an\neffective accretion radius, which determines the radius within which gas\nparticles are added to the accretion disc, and a viscous time-scale which\ndetermines how long it takes for material in the accretion disc to accrete on\nto the black hole itself. We find that there is a limited range of permitted\naccretion radii and viscous time-scales, with unphysical results produced\noutside this range. For permitted model parameters, the nuclear regions of\nsimulations with the same resolution follow similar evolutionary paths,\nproducing final black hole masses that are consistent within a factor of two.\nWhen comparing the resolution dependence of the model, there is a trend towards\nhigher resolution producing slightly lower mass black holes, but values for the\ntwo resolutions studied again agree within a factor of two. We also compare\nthese results to two other AGN feedback algorithms found in the literature.\nWhile the evolution of the systems vary, most notably the intermediate total\nblack hole mass, the final black hole masses differ by less than a factor of\nfive amongst all of our models, and the remnants exhibit similar structural\nparameters. The implication of this accretion model is that, unlike most\naccretion algorithms, a decoupling of the accretion rate on to the black hole\nand the local gas properties is permitted and obtained; this allows for black\nhole growth even after feedback has prevented additional accretion events on to\nthe disc.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jan 2013 21:00:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

In this study, we\nintentionally shift incident angle information contained in a high-quality XRR\ndata set and refine this shifted data using an identical structural model to\nassess the effect angle misalignment has on parameter estimation. We develop a\nseries of calibration curves relating data misalignment to variation with layer\nthickness and density for a multilayer GaAs/AlAs Certified Reference Material\non a GaAs substrate.

This is a\nfortuitous result, as buried AlAs and GaAs exhibit the highest long-term\nstability in thickness. Therefore, it is indeed possible to use reference\nthickness estimates to validate XRR angle alignment accuracy. Buried layer mass\ndensity information also shows promise as a robust calibration approach. This\nis suprising, as electron density of buried layers is both a highly-correlated\nphenomenon, and a subtle component in the XRR model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jan 2013 21:54:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Nov 2013 20:24:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

We study whether the acceleration\nmechanism can be constrained by the cutoff shape of the electron spectrum\naround the maximum energy.

They are related to the energy\ndependence of the electron diffusion coefficient. Next, we discuss whether\ninformation on the cutoff shape can be provided by observations in the near\nfuture which will simply give the photon indices and the flux ratios in the\nsoft and hard X-ray bands. We find that if the power-law index of the electron\nspectrum is independently determined by other observations, then we can\nconstrain the cutoff shape by comparing theoretical predictions of the photon\nindices and/or the flux ratios with observed data which will be measured by\nNuSTAR and/or ASTRO-H.

The peak values of H magnitude and (J-H)\ncolour of the observed red clump distribution are obtained by fitting a profile\nto the distributions and also by taking the average value of magnitude and\ncolour of the red clump stars in the bin with largest number. Then the\ndereddened peak H0 magnitude of the red clump stars in each sub-region is\nobtained. The RA, Dec and relative distance from the center of each sub-region\nare converted into x, y & z Cartesian coordinates. A weighted least square\nplane fitting method is applied to this x,y,z data to estimate the structural\nparameters of the LMC disk. A reddening map based on (J-H) colour of the RC\nstars is presented.

However, it is known\nthat the radiation is miraculously cancelled by a quantum interference effect.\nIn this paper, we investigate under what condition the radiation cancels out.\nWe first show that the cancellation occurs if the Green function satisfies a\nrelation similar to the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) condition.

The SFXTs dynamic\nrange, with X-ray luminosities from 1E32 erg/s to 1E37 erg/s, and long time\nintervals of low X-ray emission, are puzzling, given that both their donor star\nproperties and their orbital and spin periodicities seem very similar to those\ndisplayed by massive binaries with persistent X-ray emission. Clumpy supergiant\nwinds, accretion barriers, orbital geometries and wind anisotropies are often\ninvoked to explain their behavior, but still several open issues remain. A\nreview of the main recent observational results will be outlined, together with\na summary of the new scenarios proposed to explain their bright flaring X-ray\nactivity. The main result of a long Suzaku observation of the SFXT\nIGRJ16479-4514 with the shortest orbital period is also briefly summarized. The\nobservation of the X-ray eclipse in this source allowed us to directly probe\nthe supergiant wind density at the orbital separation, leading to the\nconclusion that it is too large to justify the low X-ray luminosity. A\nmechanism reducing the accretion rate onto the compact object is required.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Jan 2013 10:22:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-01"}

The\nassumption of the turbulent mean acts as a restriction on the class of possible\nstructures. It is shown that the coherent structure is a manifestation of\nessentially low-dimensional flow dynamics, arising from a critical layer\nmechanism. Using the decomposition presented in McKeon & Sharma (J. Fluid Mech,\n658, 2010), complex coherent structure is recreated from minimal superpositions\nof response modes predicted by the analysis, which take the form of\nradially-varying travelling waves. By way of example, simple combinations of\nthese modes are offered that predicts hairpins and modulated hairpin packets.\n  The phase interaction also predicts important skewness and correlation\nresults known in the literature.\n  It is also shown that the very large scale motions act to organise\nhairpin-like structures such that they co-locate with areas of low streamwise\nmomentum, by a mechanism of locally varying the shear profile.\n  The relationship between Taylor's hypothesis and coherence is discussed and\nboth are shown to be the consequence of the localisation of the response modes\naround the critical layer.\n  A pleasing link is made to the classical laminar inviscid theory, whereby the\nessential mechanism underlying the hairpin vortex is captured by two obliquely\ninteracting Kelvin-Stuart (cat's eye) vortices.

The selected flares can be interpreted as having a\nstandard geometry with chromospheric HXR footpoint sources related to\nthick-target X-ray emission and the coronal sources characterised by a\ncombination of thermal and thin-target bremsstrahlung. Using imaging\nspectroscopy techniques, we deduce the characteristic electron rates and\nspectral indices required to explain the coronal and footpoint X-ray sources.\nWe found that, during the impulsive phase, the electron rate at the looptop is\nseveral times (a factor of 1.7-8) higher than at the footpoints. The results\nsuggest that a sufficient number of electrons accelerated in the looptop\nexplain the precipitation into the footpoints and imply that electrons\naccumulate in the looptop. We discuss these results in terms of magnetic\ntrapping, pitch-angle scattering, and injection properties. Our conclusion is\nthat the accelerated electrons must be subject to magnetic trapping and/or\npitch-angle scattering, keeping a fraction of the population trapped inside the\ncoronal loops. These findings put strong constraints on the particle transport\nin the coronal source and provide quantitative limits on deka-keV electron\ntrapping/scattering in the coronal source.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Jan 2013 12:27:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Feb 2013 10:41:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

We have studied to what extent increasing the distance between\nout-vessel sensors and plasma can be compensated for sensor accuracy and/or\ndensity before the limit imposed by the degeneracy of the problem is reached.\nThe study is particularized for the Swiss TCV tokamak, due to the quality of\nits magnetic data and its ability to operate with a wide range of plasma shapes\nand divertor configurations.

In\nparticular, the algorithm design is formulated as a high-dimensional non-convex\noptimization problem which takes into account the circuit power consumption,\nthe minimum required data rate, and a constraint on the minimum power delivered\nto the receiver. Subsequently, by exploiting the properties of nonlinear\nfractional programming, the considered non-convex optimization problem, whose\nobjective function is in fractional form, is transformed into an equivalent\noptimization problem having an objective function in subtractive form, which\nenables the derivation of an efficient iterative power allocation algorithm. In\neach iteration, the optimal power allocation solution is derived based on dual\ndecomposition and a one-dimensional search. Simulation results illustrate that\nthe proposed iterative power allocation algorithm converges to the optimal\nsolution, and unveil the trade-off between energy efficiency, system capacity,\nand wireless power transfer: (1) In the low transmit power regime, maximizing\nthe system capacity may maximize the energy efficiency.

The main focus is on the impact of transverse\nanisotropy on transport characteristics and the adatom's/SMM's spin. In\nparticular, we analyze the role of quantum tunneling of magnetization (QTM) in\nthe mechanism of the current-induced spin switching, and show that the QTM\nphenomenon becomes revealed as resonant peaks in the average values of the\nmolecule's spin and in the charge current. These features appear at some\nresonant fields and are observable when at least one of the electrodes is\nferromagnetic. We also show that the conductance generally depends on the\nrelative orientation of the average adatom's/SMM's spin and electrode's\nmagnetic moment. This spin-valve like magnetoresistance effect can be used to\ncontrol spin switching of the adatom's/SMM's spin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Jan 2013 14:03:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-22"}

The technique leverages the\nprimary ARQ protocol to perform Interference Cancellation (IC) at the SU\nreceiver (SUrx). Two IC mechanisms that work in concert are introduced: Forward\nIC, where SUrx, after decoding the PU message, cancels its interference in the\n(possible) following PU retransmissions of the same message, to improve the SU\nthroughput; Backward IC, where SUrx performs IC on previous SU transmissions,\nwhose decoding failed due to severe PU interference. Secondary access policies\nare designed that determine the secondary access probability in each state of\nthe network so as to maximize the average long-term SU throughput by\nopportunistically leveraging IC, while causing bounded average long-term PU\nthroughput degradation and SU power expenditure. It is proved that the optimal\npolicy prescribes that the SU prioritizes its access in the states where SUrx\nknows the PU message, thus enabling IC. An algorithm is provided to optimally\nallocate additional secondary access opportunities in the states where the PU\nmessage is unknown. Numerical results are shown to assess the throughput gain\nprovided by the proposed techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jan 2013 17:33:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-13"}

A hemispheric asymmetry in\nmagnetic activity is clearly observed and its evolution monitored and the\nresulting (prolonged) magnetic imbalance must have had a considerable impact on\nthe structure and energetics of the heliosphere. While we cannot uniquely tie\nthe variance and scale of the surface magnetism to the dwindling radiative and\nparticulate output of the star, or the increased cosmic ray flux through the\n2009 minimum, the timing of the decline and rapid recovery in early 2010 would\nappear to inextricably link them. These observations support a picture where\nthe Sun's hemispheres are significantly out of phase with each other. Studying\nhistorical sunspot records with this picture in mind shows that the northern\nhemisphere has been leading since the middle of the last century and that the\nhemispheric \"dominance\" has changed twice in the past 130 years. The\nobservations presented give clear cause for concern, especially with respect to\nour present understanding of the processes that produce the surface magnetism\nin the (hidden) solar interior - hemispheric asymmetry is the normal state -\nthe strong symmetry shown in 1996 was abnormal. Further, these observations\nshow that the mechanism(s) which create and transport the magnetic flux\nmagnetic flux are slowly changing with time and, it appears, with only loose\ncoupling across the equator such that those asymmetries can persist for a\nconsiderable time. As the current asymmetry persists and the basal energetics\nof the system continue to dwindle we anticipate new radiative and particulate\nlows coupled with increased cosmic ray fluxes heading into the next solar\nminimum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jan 2013 17:30:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}
