This yields a very simple universal\nprediction scheme which is similar to Follow-the-Perturbed-Leader (FPL) and\nworks for a large class of loss functions, as well as a partial justification\nfor using probabilistic assumptions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Jan 2013 22:37:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-29"}

This fundamental result has an\ninteresting interpretation as a law of conservation of information flow.\nBuilding upon it, we derive several novel identities and inequalities, which\nallow us to prove some existing information inequalities under less restrictive\nassumptions. Finally, we establish new relationships between nested directed\ninformations inside a feedback loop. This yields a new and general\ndata-processing inequality for systems with feedback.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Jan 2013 02:00:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-29"}

This physics includes\nBardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer-like pairing, Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids, spin-charge\nseparation, Fulde-Ferrel-Larkin-Ovchinnikov-like pair correlations, quantum\ncriticality and scaling, polarons and the few-body physics of the trimer state\n(trions). The fascinating interplay between exactly solved models and\nexperimental developments in one dimension promises to yield further insight\ninto the exciting and fundamental physics of interacting Fermi systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Jan 2013 04:44:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 31 Jul 2013 09:34:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-02"}

In this paper, we aim to obtain a better\nunderstanding of symmetries of oriented matroids. First, we put focus on\nsymmetries of matroids, and give a general construction that generates a\n$3$-dimensional point configuration with a matroidal symmetry that cannot be\nrealized as a geometric symmetry. The construction is based on the observation\nthat every non-trivial rotation in the $2$-dimensional Euclidean space has a\nunique fixed point but that there is no corresponding property for matroids.\nThe construction suggests that the lack of the fixed point theorem generates a\nbig gap between matroidal symmetries and geometric symmetries of point\nconfigurations. Motivated by this insight, we study fixed-point properties for\nsymmetry groups of oriented matroids. For rotational symmetries of oriented\nmatroids, we prove a useful property, which corresponds to the uniqueness of\nfixed points (in the rank $3$ case). Using it, we classify rotational and full\nsymmetry groups of simple oriented matroids of rank $3$. In addition, we define\nfixed-point-admitting (FPA) property for subgroups of symmetry groups of\noriented matroids, and make classification of rotational symmetry groups with\nFPA property of simple acyclic oriented matroids of rank $4$.

After assuming two possible EEDs formed\nin different acceleration models: the shock accelerated power-law with\nexponential cut-off (PLC) EED and the stochastic turbulence accelerated\nlog-parabolic (LP) EED, we fit the observed SEDs of Mrk 421 in both low and\ngiant flare states by using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method which\nconstrains the model parameters in a more efficient way.

The parameters of the dust and the\ndust shell are constrained by comparing the SED and NIR intensity and\npolarisation data with the models. The polarisation in the envelope reaches 50\n-- 60 % and is nearly constant in the H and K_S bands in the observations. This\nweak wavelength dependence of the polarisation can be reproduced with a grain\nsize distribution function for the torus: 0.05 micron <= a with\nn(a)=a^{-(p=5.5)}exp(-a/{a_c=0.3 micron}). The power index p is significantly\nsteeper than that for interstellar dust. Similar results have also been found\nin some other PPNs and suggest that mechanisms that grind down large particles\nmay also have acted when the dust particles formed. The spectral opacity index\nbeta is found to be 0.6+/-0.5 from the millimeter fluxes. This low value\nindicates the presence of large dust grains in the torus. We discuss two\npossible dust models for the torus.

This interpretation\nrelies on the distribution on the boundary of a stopped random process with\nFeynman-Kac weights. Practical computations require in addition the explicit\napproximation of the normal derivative of the groundstate on the boundary. We\nthen propose to use this formulation in the case of the so-called fixed node\napproximation of fermion groundstates, defined by the bottom eigenelements of\nthe Schr\\\"odinger operator of a fermionic system with Dirichlet conditions on\nthe nodes (the set of zeros) of an initially guessed skew-symmetric function.\nWe show that the shape derivative of the fixed node energy vanishes if and only\nif either (i) the distribution on the nodes of the stopped random process is\nsymmetric; or (ii) the nodes are exactly the zeros of a skew-symmetric\neigenfunction of the operator. We propose an approximation of the shape\nderivative of the fixed node energy that can be computed with a Monte-Carlo\nalgorithm, which can be referred to as Nodal Monte-Carlo (NMC). The latter\napproximation of the shape derivative also vanishes if and only if either (i)\nor (ii) holds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Jan 2013 09:39:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-29"}

Their\nproperties divide weighted networks in two broad classes: one is characterized\nby small hierarchically nested holes, while the second displays larger and\nlonger living inhomogeneities.

We aim to model the spatial\nevolution of the charge and hydrogenation states of PAHs in PDRs. We focus on\nthe specific case of the north-west (NW) PDR of NGC 7023 and also discuss the\ncase of the diffuse interstellar medium (ISM). The physical conditions in NGC\n7023 NW are modelled using a state-of-the-art PDR code. We then use a new PAH\nchemical evolution model that includes recent experimental data on PAHs and\ndescribes multiphoton events. We consider a family of compact PAHs bearing up\nto 96 carbon atoms. The calculated ionization ratio is in good agreement with\nobservations in NGC 7023 NW. Within the PDR, PAHs evolve into three major\npopulations: medium-sized PAHs (50<Nc<90) are normally hydrogenated, larger\nPAHs (Nc>90) can be superhydrogenated, and smaller species (Nc<50) are fully\ndehydrogenated. In the cavity, where the fullerene C60 was recently detected,\nall the studied PAHs are found to be quickly fully dehydrogenated. PAH chemical\nevolution exhibits a complex non-linear behaviour as a function of the UV\nradiation field because of multiphoton events. Steady state for hydrogenation\nis reached on timescales ranging from less than a year for small PAHs, up to\n10000 years for large PAHs at Av=1. We identified critical reactions that need\nmore studies. Our new model allows us to rationalize the observational\nconstraints without any fitting parameter. PAHs smaller than 50 carbon atoms\nare not expected to survive in the NGC 7023 NW PDR. A similar conclusion is\nobtained for the diffuse ISM. Carbon clusters turn out to be end products of\nPAH photodissociation, and the evolution of these clusters needs to be\ninvestigated further to evaluate their impact on the chemical and physical\nevolution of PDRs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Jan 2013 10:26:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

In\nnetwork sciences mobility studies have become popular in the past few years,\nespecially using mobile phone location data. For preserving the customer\nprivacy, datasets furnished by telecom operators are anonymized. At the same\ntime, the large size of datasets often makes the task of calculating all\nobserved trajectories very difficult and time-consuming. One solution could be\nto sample users. However, the fact of not having information about the mobile\nuser makes the sampling delicate. Some researchers select randomly a sample of\nusers from their dataset. Others try to optimize this method, for example,\ntaking into account only users with a certain number or frequency of locations\nrecorded. At the first glance, the second choice seems to be more efficient:\nhaving more individual traces makes the analysis more precise. However, the\nmost frequently used CDR data (Call Detail Records) have location generated\nonly at the moment of communication (call, SMS, data connection). Due to this\nfact, users mobility patterns cannot be precisely built upon their\ncommunication patterns. Hence, these data have evident short-comings both in\nterms of spatial and temporal scale. In this paper we propose to estimate the\ncorrelation between the users communication and mo- bility in order to better\nassess the bias of frequency based sampling.

For the design\nof such telescopes, usually physics constrains the field-of-view, while the\nphoto-sensor size is defined by limited options. Including the effect of\nlight-concentrators in front of the photo sensor, it is demonstrated that these\nconstraints are enough to mutually constrain all other design parameters. The\ndependability of the various design parameters naturally arises once a\nrelationship between the value of the point-spread functions at the edge of the\nfield-of-view and the pixel field-of-view is introduced. To be able to include\nthis constraint into a system of equations, an analytical description for the\npoint-spread function of a tessellated Davies-Cotton reflector is derived from\nTaylor developments and ray-tracing simulations. Including higher order terms\nrenders the result precise on the percent level.\n  Design curves are provided within the typical phase space of Cherenkov\ntelescopes.

Allowing an immediate comparison of several options with identical\nphysics performance allows the determination of the most cost efficient\nsolution. Emphasize is given on the possible application of solid light\nconcentrators with their typically about two times better concentration\nallowing the use of small photo sensors such as Geiger-mode avalanche photo\ndiodes.

The diagrams of a web world are generalizations of graphs,\nand each is built on the same underlying graph. Instead of ordinary vertices\nthe diagrams have pegs, and edges incident to a peg have different heights on\nthe peg. The web world of a web diagram is the set of all web diagrams that\nresult from permuting the order in which endpoints of edges appear on a peg.\nThe motivation comes from particle physics, where web diagrams arise as\nparticular types of Feynman diagrams describing scattering amplitudes in\nnon-Abelian gauge (Yang-Mills) theories. To each web world we associate two\nmatrices called the web-colouring matrix and web-mixing matrix. The entries of\nthese matrices are indexed by ordered pairs of web diagrams (D_1,D_2), and are\ncomputed from those colourings of the edges of D_1 that yield D_2 under a\ntransformation determined by each colouring.\n  We show that colourings of a web diagram (whose constituent indecomposable\ndiagrams are all unique) that lead to a reconstruction of the diagram are\nequivalent to order-preserving mappings of certain partially ordered sets\n(posets) that may be constructed from the web diagrams. For web worlds whose\nweb graphs have all edge labels equal to 1, the diagonal entries of web-mixing\nand web-colouring matrices are obtained by summing certain polynomials\ndetermined by the descents in permutations in the Jordan-Holder set of all\nlinear extensions of the associated poset.

Assume that the two dimensional subspace\nH^{2,0}(X) + H^{0,2}(X), of the second cohomology of X with complex\ncoefficients, intersects trivially the integral cohomology. We prove that the\nlinear system of L is base point free and it induces a Lagrangian fibration on\nX. In particular, the line-bundle L is effective. A determination of the\nsemi-group of effective divisor classes on X follows, when X is projective. For\na generic such pair (X,L), not necessarily projective, we show that X is\nbimeromorphic to a Tate-Shafarevich twist of a moduli space of stable torsion\nsheaves, each with pure one dimensional support, on a projective K3 surface.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Jan 2013 15:58:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 24 Feb 2013 03:36:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 7 Nov 2013 21:14:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-11"}

Now, coming back to the finite dimensional case, these methods give a new\nlight on the very classical concept of 'numerical approximation' and suggest\nchanges in the habits. We show that for some kinds of approximations only an\nIto-like second order differential calculus is relevant to describe and\npropagate numerical errors through a mathematical model. We call these\nsituations strongly stochastic. The main point of this work is an argument\nbased on the arbitrary functions principle of Poincar\\'e-Hopf showing that the\nerrors due to measurements with graduated instruments are strongly stochastic.\nEventually we discuss the consequences of this phenomenon on the specification\nof an approximate numerical result.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Jan 2013 19:27:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-04"}

After equating the two quantum measurement\nprotocols, we then apply this equivalence to the black hole radiation. That is,\nthe black hole evaporation corresponds to the quantum measurement process and\nthe two evaporation approaches, the observable-based single-system and the\ntwo-system entanglement-based protocols, can be made equivalent using quantum\nmemory. In particular, the measurement choice, \\theta, with the memory state\ninside the horizon in the entanglement-based scheme is shown to correspond to\nthe observable of the measurement choice, \\theta, outside the horizon in the\nsingle-system protocol, that is, O_{\\theta}^{out} = Q_{\\theta}^{in}. This\nindicates that the black hole as quantum memory is filling up with negative\ninformation outside the horizon, and its entropy corresponds to the logarithm\nof a number of equally probable measurement choices.
