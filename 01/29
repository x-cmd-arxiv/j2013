Velocities of liquid structures were determined\nfrom time-resolved ultrafast shadow images, formed by an amplified two-pulse\nlaser source coupled to a double-frame camera. A statistical analysis of the\ndata over many injection events was undertaken to map velocities related to\nspray formation near the nozzle outlet as a function of time after start of\ninjection. These results reveal a strong asymmetry in the liquid profile of the\ntest injector, with distinct fast and slow regions on opposite sides of the\norifice. Differences of ~100 m/s can be observed between the 'fast' and 'slow'\nsides of the jet, resulting in different atomization conditions across the\nspray. On average, droplets are dispersed at a greater distance from the nozzle\non the 'fast' side of the flow, and distinct macrostructure can be observed\nunder the asymmetric velocity conditions. The changes in structural velocity\nand atomization behavior resemble flow structures which are often observed in\nthe presence of string cavitation produced under controlled conditions in\nscaled, transparent test nozzles. These observations suggest that widely used\ncommon-rail supply configurations and modern injectors can potentially generate\nasymmetric interior flows which strongly influence diesel spray morphology. The\nvelocimetry measurements presented in this work represent an effective and\nrelatively straightforward approach to identify deviant flow behavior in real\ndiesel sprays, providing new spatially resolved information on fluid structure\nand flow characteristics within the shear layers on the jet periphery.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Jan 2013 16:25:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-29"}

A novel subcarrier-pair based opportunistic DF relaying protocol is\nproposed. Specifically, user message bits are transmitted in two time slots. A\nsubcarrier in the first slot can be paired with a subcarrier in the second slot\nfor the DF relay-aided transmission to a user. In particular, the source and\nthe relay can transmit simultaneously to implement beamforming at the\nsubcarrier in the second slot. Each unpaired subcarrier in either the first or\nsecond slot is used for the source's direct transmission to a user. A benchmark\nprotocol, same as the proposed one except that the transmit beamforming is not\nused for the relay-aided transmission, is also considered. For each protocol, a\npolynomial-complexity algorithm is developed to find at least an approximately\noptimum resource allocation (RA), by using continuous relaxation, the dual\nmethod, and Hungarian algorithm. Instrumental to the algorithm design is an\nelegant definition of optimization variables, motivated by the idea of\nregarding the unpaired subcarriers as virtual subcarrier pairs in the direct\ntransmission mode. The effectiveness of the RA algorithm and the impact of\nrelay position and total power on the protocols' performance are illustrated by\nnumerical experiments. The proposed protocol always leads to a maximum WSR\nequal to or greater than that for the benchmark one, and the performance gain\nof using the proposed one is significant especially when the relay is in close\nproximity to the source and the total power is low.

We preform a\ndetailed analysis of measuring top-quark polarization in the production\nchannels $gb\\to tH^-$ and $g\\bar{b}\\to \\bar{t}H^+$. We calculate the helicity\namplitudes of the charged Higgs boson production and decay.Our calculation\nshows that the top-quark from the charged Higgs boson decay provides a good\nprobe for measuring $\\tan\\beta$, especially for the intermediate $\\tan\\beta$\nregion. On the contrary, the top-quark produced in association with the charged\nHiggs boson cannot be used to measure $\\tan\\beta$ because its polarization is\nhighly contaminated by the $t$-channel kinematics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Jan 2013 17:05:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Apr 2013 14:30:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-10"}

In many real-world\napplications, however, the linkage structure of the graphs is inherently\nuncertain. Therefore, existing measurements of interestingness based upon\ncertain graphs are unable to capture the structural uncertainty in these\napplications effectively. In this paper, we study the problem of discriminative\nsubgraph feature selection from uncertain graphs. This problem is challenging\nand different from conventional subgraph mining problems because both the\nstructure of the graph objects and the discrimination score of each subgraph\nfeature are uncertain. To address these challenges, we propose a novel\ndiscriminative subgraph feature selection method, DUG, which can find\ndiscriminative subgraph features in uncertain graphs based upon different\nstatistical measures including expectation, median, mode and phi-probability.\nWe first compute the probability distribution of the discrimination scores for\neach subgraph feature based on dynamic programming. Then a branch-and-bound\nalgorithm is proposed to search for discriminative subgraphs efficiently.\nExtensive experiments on various neuroimaging applications (i.e., Alzheimer's\nDisease, ADHD and HIV) have been performed to analyze the gain in performance\nby taking into account structural uncertainties in identifying discriminative\nsubgraph features for graph classification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Jan 2013 18:00:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-29"}

Here, we consider a dielectric jump between the\nwalls and a solvent in which charges are immersed, implying repulsive images.\nUsing recently developed series representations of lattice sums for Coulomb\nlaw, we derive the complete phase diagram. In contrast to the homogeneous\ndielectric case, the particles remain in a hexagonal Wigner monolayer up to a\ncertain distance between the walls. Beyond this distance, a bifurcation occurs\nto a sequence of Wigner bilayers, each layer having a nonzero spacing from the\nnearest wall. Another new phenomenon is that the ground-state energy as a\nfunction of the wall separation exhibits a global minimum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Jan 2013 18:04:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

We have used a Bayesian analysis in\nthe time domain, accelerated using the recently developed ABC-method which\nconsists of a form of lossy linear data compression. The TOAs were first\nprocessed with Tempo2, where the design matrix was extracted for use in a\nsubsequent Bayesian analysis. We used different noise models to analyse the\ndatasets: no red noise, red noise the same for all pulsars, and individual red\nnoise per pulsar. We sampled from the likelihood with four different samplers:\n\"emcee\", \"t-walk\", \"Metropolis-Hastings\", and \"pyMultiNest\". All but emcee\nagreed on the final result, with emcee failing due to artefacts of the\nhigh-dimensionality of the problem. An interesting issue we ran into was that\nthe prior of all the 36 (red) noise amplitudes strongly affects the results. A\nflat prior in the noise amplitude biases the inferred GWB amplitude, whereas a\nflat prior in log-amplitude seems to work well. This issue is only apparent\nwhen using a noise model with individually modelled red noise for all pulsars.\nOur results for the blind challenges are in good agreement with the injected\nvalues. For the GWB amplitudes we found h_c = 1.03 +/- 0.11 [10^{-14}], h_c =\n5.70 +/- 0.35 [10^{-14}], and h_c = 6.91 +/- 1.72 [10^{-15}], and for the GWB\nspectral index we found gamma = 4.28 +/- 0.20, gamma = 4.35 +/- 0.09, and gamma\n= 3.75 +/- 0.40. We note that for closed challenge 3 there was quite some\ncovariance between the signal and the red noise: if we constrain the GWB\nspectral index to the usual choice of gamma = 13/3, we obtain the estimates:\nh_c = 10.0 +/- 0.64 [10^{-15}], h_c = 56.3 +/- 2.42 [10^{-15}], and h_c = 4.83\n+/- 0.50 [10^{-15}], with one-sided 2 sigma upper-limits of: h_c <= 10.98\n[10^{-15}], h_c <= 60.29 [10^{-15}], and h_c <= 5.65 [10^{-15}].\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Jan 2013 20:56:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-29"}

Most current estimates of the\nboundaries of the HZ are based on 1-D, cloud-free, climate model calculations\nby Kasting et al.(1993). The inner edge of the HZ in Kasting et al.(1993) model\nwas determined by loss of water, and the outer edge was determined by the\nmaximum greenhouse provided by a CO2 atmosphere. A conservative estimate for\nthe width of the HZ from this model in our Solar system is 0.95-1.67 AU.\n  Here, an updated 1-D radiative-convective, cloud-free climate model is used\nto obtain new estimates for HZ widths around F, G, K and M stars. New H2O and\nCO2 absorption coefficients, derived from the HITRAN 2008 and HITEMP 2010\nline-by-line databases, are important improvements to the climate model.\nAccording to the new model, the water loss (inner HZ) and maximum greenhouse\n(outer HZ) limits for our Solar System are at 0.99 AU and 1.70 AU,\nrespectively, suggesting that the present Earth lies near the inner edge.\nAdditional calculations are performed for stars with effective temperatures\nbetween 2600 K and 7200 K, and the results are presented in parametric form,\nmaking them easy to apply to actual stars. The new model indicates that, near\nthe inner edge of the HZ, there is no clear distinction between runaway\ngreenhouse and water loss limits for stars with T_{eff} ~< 5000 K which has\nimplications for ongoing planet searches around K and M stars. To assess the\npotential habitability of extrasolar terrestrial planets, we propose using\nstellar flux incident on a planet rather than equilibrium temperature. Our\nmodel does not include the radiative effects of clouds; thus, the actual HZ\nboundaries may extend further in both directions than the estimates just given.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Jan 2013 20:57:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 Feb 2013 18:00:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

Contrasting these two numerical approaches,\nwe find significant physical differences in the thermodynamic history of\naccreted gas in haloes above 10^10.5 solar masses. In agreement with previous\nwork, GADGET simulations show a cold fraction near unity for galaxies forming\nin massive haloes, implying that only a small percentage of accreted gas heats\nto an appreciable fraction of the virial temperature during accretion. The same\ngalaxies in AREPO show a much lower cold fraction, <20% in haloes above 10^11\nsolar masses. This results from a hot gas accretion rate which, at this same\nhalo mass, is an order of magnitude larger than with GADGET, while the cold\naccretion rate is also lower. These discrepancies increase for more massive\nsystems, and we explain both as due to numerical inaccuracies in the standard\nformulation of SPH. We also observe that the relatively sharp transition from\ncold to hot mode dominated accretion, at a halo mass of ~10^11, is a\nconsequence of comparing past gas temperatures to a constant threshold value\nindependent of virial temperature. Examining the spatial distribution of\naccreting gas, we find that gas filaments in GADGET tend to remain collimated\nand flow coherently to small radii, or artificially fragment and form a large\nnumber of purely numerical \"blobs\". Similar gas streams in AREPO show increased\nheating and disruption at 0.25-0.5 virial radii and contribute to the hot gas\naccretion rate in a manner distinct from classical cooling flows.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Jan 2013 21:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-30"}

In a previous paper we showed that the luminosity\nof compact jets continuously launched due to accretion onto black holes in\nX-ray binaries (analogous to those that dominate the kinetic feedback from AGN)\ndo not appear to correlate with reported black hole spin measurements. It is\ntherefore unclear whether extraction of the black hole spin energy is the main\ndriver powering compact jets from accreting black holes. Occasionally, black\nhole X-ray binaries produce discrete, transient (ballistic) jets for a brief\ntime over accretion state changes. Here, we quantify the dependence of the\npower of these transient jets (adopting two methods to infer the jet power) on\nblack hole spin, making use of all the available data in the current\nliterature, which includes 12 BHs with both measured spin parameters and radio\nflares over the state transition.

Recently, many such\napplications generate data in the form of streams. Clustering massive, dynamic\ngraph streams is significantly challenging because of the complex structures of\ngraphs and computational difficulties of continuous data. Meanwhile, a large\nvolume of side information is associated with graphs, which can be of various\ntypes. The examples include the properties of users in social network\nactivities, the meta attributes associated with web click graph streams and the\nlocation information in mobile communication networks. Such attributes contain\nextremely useful information and has the potential to improve the clustering\nprocess, but are neglected by most recent graph stream mining techniques. In\nthis paper, we define a unified distance measure on both link structures and\nside attributes for clustering. In addition, we propose a novel optimization\nframework DMO, which can dynamically optimize the distance metric and make it\nadapt to the newly received stream data. We further introduce a carefully\ndesigned statistics SGS(C) which consume constant storage spaces with the\nprogression of streams. We demonstrate that the statistics maintained are\nsufficient for the clustering process as well as the distance optimization and\ncan be scalable to massive graphs with side attributes.

We find that UVB feedback: (i) delays the\nend stages of reionization by less than 0.5 in redshift; (ii) results in a more\nuniform distribution of HII regions, peaked on smaller-scales (with large-scale\nionization power suppressed by tens of percent); and (iii) suppresses the\nglobal photoionization rate per baryon by a factor of < 2 towards the end of\nreionization. However, the impact is modest, since the hydrodynamic response of\nthe gas to the UVB occurs on a time-scale comparable to reionization. In\nparticular, the popular approach of modeling UVB feedback with an instantaneous\ntransition in the minimum mass of star-forming galaxies, dramatically\noverestimates its importance. UVB feedback does not significantly affect\nreionization unless: (i) molecularly-cooled galaxies contribute significantly\nto reionization; or (ii) internal feedback processes strongly couple with UVB\nfeedback in the early Universe. Since both are considered unlikely, we conclude\nthat there is no significant self-regulation of reionization by UVB feedback.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Jan 2013 21:34:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

In the local universe\nsimilar-mass (within a factor of two) galaxies tend to be a factor of 4 to 5\nlarger. Dry minor mergers are known to drive the evolution of the size of a\ngalaxy without much increasing the mass, but it is unclear if the growth in\nsize is sufficient to explain the observations. We test the hypothesis that\ngalaxies grow through dry minor mergers by simulating merging galaxies with\nmass ratios of q=1:1 (equal mass) to q=1:160. In our N-body simulations the\ntotal mass of the parent galaxy doubles. We confirm that major mergers do not\ncause a sufficient growth in size. The observation can be explained with\nmergers with a mass ratio of q=1:5--1:10. Smaller mass ratios cause a more\ndramatic growth in size, up to a factor of ~17 for mergers with a mass ratio of\n1:80. For relatively massive minor mergers q ~> 1:20 the mass of the incoming\nchild galaxies tend to settle in the halo of the parent galaxy. This is caused\nby the tidal stripping of the child galaxies by the time they enter the central\nportion of the parent. When the accretion of minor galaxies becomes more\ncontinuous, when q <~ 1:40, the foreign mass tends to concentrate more in the\ncentral region of the parent galaxy. We speculate that this is caused by\ndynamic interactions between the child galaxies inside the merger remnant and\nthe longer merging times when the difference in mass is larger. These\ninteractions cause dynamical heating which results in accretion of mass inside\nthe galaxy core and a reduction of the parent's circular velocity and density.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Jan 2013 21:40:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

Assuming that meaning\ncannot be communicated, we extend Shannon's theory by defining mutual\nredundancy as a positional counterpart of the relational communication of\ninformation. Mutual redundancy indicates the surplus of meanings that can be\nprovided to the exchanges in reflexive communications. The information is\nredundant because based on \"pure sets,\" that is, without subtraction of mutual\ninformation in the overlaps. We show that in the three-dimensional case (e.g.,\nof a Triple Helix of university-industry-government relations), mutual\nredundancy is equal to mutual information (Rxyz = Txyz); but when the\ndimensionality is even, the sign is different.

Rule-based modeling overcomes this problem by representing\nmolecules as structured objects and encoding their interactions as\npattern-based rules. This greatly simplifies the process of model\nspecification, avoiding the tedious and error prone task of manually\nenumerating all species and reactions that can potentially exist in a system.\nFrom a simulation perspective, rule-based models can be expanded\nalgorithmically into fully-enumerated reaction networks and simulated using a\nvariety of network-based simulation methods, provided that the network is not\nexceedingly large.

The group A sources are further decomposed\nspectrally into thermal and non-thermal sources with different fractions in\ndifferent flux ranges. From their X-ray properties, we speculate that the group\nA non-thermal sources are mostly AGNs and the thermal sources are mostly white\ndwarf (WD) binaries such as magnetic and non-magnetic cataclysmic variables\n(CVs), pre-CVs, and symbiotic stars, whereas the group B and C sources are\nX-ray active stars in flares and quiescence, respectively.

The origin of this warm dust\ncan possibly be explained either by a collision between several bodies or by\ntransport from an outer belt. We present and analyse new far-IR Herschel/Pacs\nobservations, supplemented by ground-based data in the mid-IR (VLTI/Midi and\nVLT/Visir), for one of these rare systems: the 10-16 Myr old debris disk around\nHD 113766 A.

We underline the limitations of SED modelling and the need for\nspatially resolved observations.

The synchrotron emission follows both star-forming regions and the\nso-called magnetic arms present in the inter-arm regions. The synchrotron\nspectral index is steepest along the magnetic arms ($\\alpha_n \\sim 1$), while\nit is flat in places of giant H{\\sc ii} regions and in the center of the galaxy\n($\\alpha_n \\sim 0.6-0.7$). The map of $\\alpha_n$ provides an observational\nevidence for aging and energy loss of cosmic ray electrons propagating in the\ndisk of the galaxy. Variations in the synchrotron--FIR correlation across the\ngalaxy are shown to be a function of both star formation and magnetic fields.\nWe find that the synchrotron emission correlates better with cold rather than\nwith warm dust emission, when the interstellar radiation field is the main\nheating source of dust.

It has over 100 million active users\nwho post about 200 million tweets everyday. Phishers have started using Twitter\nas a medium to spread phishing because of this vast information dissemination.\nFurther, it is difficult to detect phishing on Twitter unlike emails because of\nthe quick spread of phishing links in the network, short size of the content,\nand use of URL obfuscation to shorten the URL. Our technique, PhishAri, detects\nphishing on Twitter in realtime. We use Twitter specific features along with\nURL features to detect whether a tweet posted with a URL is phishing or not.\nSome of the Twitter specific features we use are tweet content and its\ncharacteristics like length, hashtags, and mentions. Other Twitter features\nused are the characteristics of the Twitter user posting the tweet such as age\nof the account, number of tweets, and the follower-followee ratio. These\nTwitter specific features coupled with URL based features prove to be a strong\nmechanism to detect phishing tweets. We use machine learning classification\ntechniques and detect phishing tweets with an accuracy of 92.52%. We have\ndeployed our system for end-users by providing an easy to use Chrome browser\nextension which works in realtime and classifies a tweet as phishing or safe.\nWe show that we are able to detect phishing tweets at zero hour with high\naccuracy which is much faster than public blacklists and as well as Twitter's\nown defense mechanism to detect malicious content. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first realtime, comprehensive and usable system to\ndetect phishing on Twitter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Jan 2013 11:55:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-30"}

Some form\nof turbulent dynamo at bigger (and deeper) scales is favored. The comparison\nbetween the internetwork fields observed by Hinode and the magnetism inferred\nfrom Hanle measurements are converging towards a similar description. They are\nboth described as randomly oriented, largely transverse fields in the several\nhecto-Gauss range. These similarities are ever making more natural to assume\nthat they are the same. However, and because of the large voids of magnetic\nflux observed in the spatial distribution of the internetwork fields, it is\nargued that they are not likely to be generated by dynamo action in the\nintergranular lanes. It is concluded that if a dynamo is acting at granular\nscales, the end product might have not been observed yet at current spatial\nresolutions and sensitivities with the Zeeman effect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Jan 2013 14:35:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

Because of the large size mismatch between Li+\nand Ga3+/In3+ ions at the A site, the pyrochlore lattice, made up of Cr3+ ions\ncarrying spin 3/2, becomes an alternating array of small and large tetrahedra,\ni.e., a \"breathing\" pyrochlore lattice. We introduce a parameter, the breathing\nfactor Bf, which quantifies the degree of frustration in the pyrochlore\nlattice: Bf is defined as J'/J, where J' and J are nearest-neighbor magnetic\ninteractions in the large and small tetrahedra, respectively. LiGaCr4O8 with Bf\n~ 0.6 shows magnetic susceptibility similar to that of conventional Cr spinel\noxides such as ZnCr2O4. In contrast, LiInCr4O8 with a small Bf ~ 0.1 exhibits a\nspin-gap behavior in its magnetic susceptibility, suggesting a proximity to an\nexotic singlet ground state. Magnetic long-range order occurs at 13.8 and 15.9\nK for LiGaCr4O8 and LiInCr4O8, respectively, in both cases likely owing to the\ncoupling to structural distortions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Jan 2013 14:40:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

With a larger\nstatistical sample we can study the physical properties of asteroid\npopulations, such as main-belt asteroids or individual asteroid families, in\nmore detail. Shape models can also be used in combination with other types of\nobservational data (IR, adaptive optics images, stellar occultations), e.g., to\ndetermine sizes and thermal properties. We use all available photometric data\nof asteroids to derive their physical models by the lightcurve inversion method\nand compare the observed pole latitude distributions of all asteroids with\nknown convex shape models with the simulated pole latitude distributions.

In this method\nobservations from heliospheric images are constrained with in-situ plasma and\nfield data at 1 AU. These data are used to convert measured ICME elongations\ninto distance by applying the Harmonic Mean approach that assumes a spherical\nshape of the ICME front. We use synthetic white-light images, similar as\nobserved by STEREO-A/HI, for three different separation angles between remote\nand in-situ spacecraft, of 30{\\deg}, 60{\\deg}, and 90{\\deg}. To validate the\nresults of the method they are compared to the apex speed profile of the\nmodeled ICME, as obtained from a top view. This profile reflects the \"true\"\napex kinematics since it is not affected by scattering or projection effects.\nIn this way it is possible to determine the accuracy of the method for\nrevealing ICME propagation directions and kinematics. We found that the\ndirection obtained by the constrained Harmonic Mean method is not very\nsensitive to the separation angle (30{\\deg} sep: \\phi = W7; 60{\\deg} sep: \\phi\n= W12; 90{\\deg} sep: \\phi = W15; true dir.: E0/W0). For all three cases the\nderived kinematics are in a relatively good agreement with the real kinematics.\nThe best consistency is obtained for the 30{\\deg} case, while with growing\nseparation angle the ICME speed at 1 AU is increasingly overestimated (30{\\deg}\nsep: \\Delta V_arr ~-50 km/s, 60{\\deg} sep: \\Delta V_arr ~+75 km/s, 90{\\deg}\nsep: \\Delta V_arr ~+125 km/s).

We assume\nthe transmitter can generate an arbitrary current distribution inside a\nspherical region and the receive antennas are uniformly distributed on a bigger\nsphere surrounding the transmitter. The capacity is shown to be $(\\alpha P/N_0)\n\\log e$ [bits/sec] in the limit of large number of receive antennas, where $P$\nis the transmit power constraint, $\\alpha$ is the normalized density of the\nreceive antennas and $N_0$ is the noise power spectral density.

Second,\nthis result shows that the capacity is irrespective of the size of the region\ncontaining the transmitter. This is against some previous results that claimed\nthe maximum degrees of freedom is proportional to the surface area containing\nthe transmitter normalized by the square of the wavelength.

At a country level, some populations\nuse more water than they control because of their ability to import food and\nthe virtual water required for its production. Here, we investigate the\ndependence of demographic growth on available water resources for exporting and\nimporting nations. By quantifying the carrying capacity of nations based on\ncalculations of the virtual water available through the food trade network, we\npoint to the existence of a global water unbalance. We suggest that current\nexport rates will not be maintained and consequently we question the long-run\nsustainability of the food trade system as a whole. Water rich regions are\nlikely to soon reduce the amount of virtual water they export, thus leaving\nimport-dependent regions without enough water to sustain their populations. We\nalso investigate the potential impact of possible scenarios that might mitigate\nthese effects through (1) cooperative interactions among nations whereby water\nrich countries maintain a tiny fraction of their food production available for\nexport; (2) changes in consumption patterns; and (3) a positive feedback\nbetween demographic growth and technological innovations.
