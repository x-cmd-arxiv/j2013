For those generalized lognormal\ndistributions that are moment-indeterminate Stieltjes classes of\nmoment-equivalent distributions are presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Jan 2013 17:37:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-19"}

In gene expression models, the concept of\nbursting is a production of several molecules simultaneously and is generally\nrepresented as a compound Poisson process of random size. In a general\ntwo-dimensional birth and death discrete model, we prove that under specific\nassumptions and scaling (that are characteristics of the mRNA-protein system)\nan adiabatic reduction leads to a one-dimensional discrete-state space model\nwith bursting production. The burst term appears through the reduction of the\nfirst variable. In a two-dimensional continuous model, we also prove that an\nadiabatic reduction can be performed in a stochastic slow/fast system. In this\ngene expression model, the production of mRNA (the fast variable) is assumed to\nbe bursty and the production of protein (the slow variable) is linear as a\nfunction of mRNA. When the dynamics of mRNA is assumed to be faster than the\nprotein dynamics (due to a mRNA degradation rate larger than for the protein)\nwe prove that, with the appropriate scaling, the bursting phenomena can be\ntransmitted to the slow variable. We show that the reduced equation is either a\nstochastic differential equation with a jump Markov process or a deterministic\nordinary differential equation depending on the scaling that is appropriate.\n  These results are significant because adiabatic reduction techniques seem to\nhave not been applied to a stochastic differential system containing a jump\nMarkov process.

We\nfirst focus on measuring the delay performance of a very popular cloud storage\nservice Amazon S3. We establish that there is significant randomness in service\ntimes for reading and writing small and medium size objects when assigned\ndistinct keys. We further demonstrate that using erasure coding, parallel\nconnections to storage cloud and limited chunking (i.e., dividing the object\ninto a few smaller objects) together pushes the envelope on service time\ndistributions significantly (e.g., 76%, 80%, and 85% reductions in mean, 90th,\nand 99th percentiles for 2 Mbyte files) at the expense of additional storage\n(e.g., 1.75x). However, chunking and erasure coding increase the load and hence\nthe queuing delays while reducing the supportable rate region in number of\nrequests per second per node. Thus, in the second part of our paper we focus on\nanalyzing the delay performance when chunking, FEC, and parallel connections\nare used together.

BDPs are continuous-time Markov chains on the\nnon-negative integers and can be used to easily parameterize a rich variety of\nprobability distributions. Although the theoretical properties of general BDPs\nare well understood, traditionally statistical work on BDPs has been limited to\nthe simple linear (Kendall) process, which arises in ecology and evolutionary\napplications. Aside from a few simple cases, it remains impossible to find\nanalytic expressions for the likelihood of a discretely-observed BDP, and\ncomputational difficulties have hindered development of tools for statistical\ninference. But the gap between BDP theory and practical methods for estimation\nhas narrowed in recent years. There are now robust methods for evaluating\nlikelihoods for realizations of BDPs: finite-time transition, first passage,\nequilibrium probabilities, and distributions of summary statistics that arise\ncommonly in applications. Recent work has also exploited the connection between\ncontinuously- and discretely-observed BDPs to derive EM algorithms for maximum\nlikelihood estimation. Likelihood-based inference for previously intractable\nBDPs is much easier than previously thought and regression approaches analogous\nto Poisson regression are straightforward to derive. In this review, we outline\nthe basic mathematical theory for BDPs and demonstrate new tools for\nstatistical inference using data from BDPs. We give six examples of BDPs and\nderive EM algorithms to fit their parameters by maximum likelihood. We show how\nto compute the distribution of integral summary statistics and give an example\napplication to the total cost of an epidemic.

We simulate the nearby\n(radius 250 pc) part of this population, corresponding to the closest ~35 000\nblack holes, using current best estimates of the mass distribution of stellar\nmass black holes combined with two models for the velocity distribution of\nstellar-mass IBH which bracket likely possibilities. We distribute this\npopulation of objects appropriately within the different phases of the ISM and\ncalculate the Bondi-Hoyle accretion rate, modified by a further dimensionless\nefficiency parameter \\lambda. Assuming a simple prescription for radiatively\ninefficient accretion at low Eddington ratios, we calculate the X-ray\nluminosity of these objects, and similarly estimate the radio luminosity from\nrelations found empirically for black holes accreting at low rates. The latter\nassumption depends crucially on whether or not the IBH accrete from the ISM in\na manner which is axisymmetric enough to produce jets. Comparing the predicted\nX-ray fluxes with limits from hard X-ray surveys, we conclude that either the\nBondi-Hoyle efficiency parameter \\lambda, is rather small (< 0.01), the\nvelocities of the IBH are rather high, or some combination of both.

The aim of this paper is to investigate theoretically how\nSat can be utilized for the efficient solution of problems that are harder than\nNP or co-NP. In particular, we consider the fundamental reasoning problems in\npropositional disjunctive answer set programming (ASP), Brave Reasoning and\nSkeptical Reasoning, which ask whether a given atom is contained in at least\none or in all answer sets, respectively. Both problems are located at the\nsecond level of the Polynomial Hierarchy and thus assumed to be harder than NP\nor co-NP. One cannot transform these two reasoning problems into SAT in\npolynomial time, unless the Polynomial Hierarchy collapses. We show that\ncertain structural aspects of disjunctive logic programs can be utilized to\nbreak through this complexity barrier, using new techniques from Parameterized\nComplexity. In particular, we exhibit transformations from Brave and Skeptical\nReasoning to SAT that run in time O(2^k n^2) where k is a structural parameter\nof the instance and n the input size. In other words, the reduction is\nfixed-parameter tractable for parameter k. As the parameter k we take the size\nof a smallest backdoor with respect to the class of normal (i.e.,\ndisjunction-free) programs. Such a backdoor is a set of atoms that when deleted\nmakes the program normal. In consequence, the combinatorial explosion, which is\nexpected when transforming a problem from the second level of the Polynomial\nHierarchy to the first level, can now be confined to the parameter k, while the\nrunning time of the reduction is polynomial in the input size n, where the\norder of the polynomial is independent of k.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Jan 2013 02:29:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 May 2013 17:17:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-06"}

Second, there is of course also the well-known epistemic component\nof ASP, which was mainly emphasized in the early papers on stable model\nsemantics. To investigate whether this kind of knowledge can also, and in a\nsimilarly modular way, be added to classical logic, the language of Ordered\nEpistemic Logic was presented in recent work. However, this logic views the\nepistemic component as entirely separate from the inductive definition\ncomponent, thus ignoring any possible interplay between the two. In this paper,\nwe present a language that extends the inductive definition construct found in\nFO(ID) with an epistemic component, making such interplay possible.

We accomplish this by studying the strong\ngravitational lensing of S stars resulting from the assumption of a boson star\nin the Galactic Center. Boson stars have an extended mass distribution and are\ntransparent to electromagnetic radiation, giving rise to a radial caustic\ncurve. We calculate the brightness of images formed by stars crossing these\nradial caustics and show that a boson star would give rise to much brighter\nimages than a black hole with a similar mass and that those images would be\neasily bright enough to be detected with upcoming instruments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Jan 2013 02:33:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-09"}

A convolution technique is used to match point spread\nfunctions (PSFs) between images of the same field taken at different times\nprior to pixel-by-pixel subtraction. Particularly suitable for large-scale\nimages is a spatially-varying kernel, where the convolution is allowed to adapt\nto PSF changes as a function of position within the images. The most versatile\nbasis for fitting the spatially-varying kernel is the Dirac delta function.\nHowever, the convolution kernel based on the delta function does not\ndiscriminate between pixel scale noise variations and the intended stellar\npoint spread function signals. The situation can frequently lead to reduced\nsignal to noise ratios for variable objects detectable in the resulting\nsubtraction. This work presents a cross-correlation method for reducing noise\neffects on the delta function derived convolution kernels, thus yielding\nsignificantly improved signal to noise in the resulting subtraction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Jan 2013 05:05:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-09"}

Using it in Rubinstein and Sarnak's method estimates the\nlimiting logarithmic frequency of pi(x)>Li(x) as 0.00000026300 with only 5 zeta\nzeros used explicitly, and a reliable value between 0.000000262996732 and\n0.000000262996733 is obtained with fewer than 100 zeros. Accurate results for\n\"prime number races\" can usually be obtained with explicit use of only the\nfirst zero of each L-function involved, thus bringing out their dependence on\nthose zeros. For extreme deviations, the method of steepest descent can be\napplied, and the remainder approximated by an explicit formula together with a\nrapidly convergent series. This gives, for example, 8.649*10^(-12477) for the\nlogarithmic frequency of pi(x)>Li(x)+5*Li(sqrt(x)). The Monach - Lamzouri model\nof the extreme distribution is developed to give close agreement with these\nresults. The remainder can also be calculated explicitly as an asymptotic\nseries. This allows good modelling of non-extreme races and the calculation of\ndistributions by direct convolution. The three different methods agree to\nwithin 0.001% where they overlap in application. The distribution calculated\nfrom values of pi(x) for x<10^20 shows similar behaviour to the limiting\ndistribution, but is somewhat further from normal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Jan 2013 07:53:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-09"}

In such systems Kozai cycles can\nbe induced in the inner binary system during which the inner orbit eccentricity\nand the inclination between both binary orbits vary periodically. These cycles,\ncombined with tidal friction and gravitational wave emission, can significantly\naffect the inner binary evolution. To investigate these effects quantitatively\nwe perform a population synthesis study of triple systems and focus on\nevolutionary paths that lead to mergers of carbon-oxygen (CO) white dwarfs\n(WDs), which constitute an important candidate progenitor channel for type Ia\nsupernovae (SNe Ia). We approach this problem by Monte Carlo sampling from\nobservation-based distributions of systems within the primary mass range 1.0 -\n6.5 M_Sun and inner orbit semi-major axes a_1 and eccentricities e_1 satisfying\na_1 (1-e_1^2) > 12 AU, i.e. non-interacting in the absence of a tertiary\ncomponent. We evolve these systems by means of a newly developed algorithm that\ncouples secular triple dynamics with an existing binary population synthesis\ncode. We find that the tertiary significantly alters the inner binary evolution\nin about 24% of all sampled systems. In particular, we find several channels\nleading to CO WD mergers. Amongst these is a novel channel in which a collision\noccurs in wide inner binary systems as a result of extremely high\neccentricities induced by Kozai cycles. With assumptions on which CO WD mergers\nlead to a SN Ia explosion we estimate the SNe Ia delay time distribution\nresulting from triples and compare to a binary population synthesis study and\nto observations. Although we find that our triple rate is low, we have\ndetermined a lower limit of the triple-induced SNe Ia rate and further study is\nneeded that includes triples with initially tighter inner orbits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Jan 2013 10:13:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

We also consider stellar masses\nbetween 0.4 and 2 $M_\\odot$, with corresponding adjustments in the disk mass\nand temperature. The dead zone's size and shape are found using the Elsasser\nnumber criterion with conductivities including the contributions from ions,\nelectrons, and charged fractal dust aggregates. The charged species' abundances\nare found using the approach proposed by S. Okuzumi. The dead zone is in most\ncases defined by the ambipolar diffusion.

Furthermore, it is reasonable to include the exchange\nrules in the argument of the risk measure and so consider risk measures of\nset-valued portfolios. This situation includes the classical Kabanov's\ntransaction costs model, where the set-valued portfolio is given by the sum of\na random vector and an exchange cone, but also a number of further cases of\nadditional liquidity constraints.\n  We suggest a definition of the risk measure based on calling a set-valued\nportfolio acceptable if it possesses a selection with all individually\nacceptable marginals.

Nevertheless, density\nprofiles often rely either on the simplifying assumption of isothermality or on\nobservationally poorly constrained model temperature profiles. With the aim of\nbetter constraining the initial physical conditions in molecular cloud cores at\nthe onset of protostellar collapse, we initiated the Guaranteed Time Key\nProject (GTKP) \"The Earliest Phases of Star Formation\" (EPoS) with the Herschel\nsatellite. This paper gives an overview of the low-mass sources in the EPoS\nproject, including all observations, the analysis method, and the initial\nresults of the survey.

The dust emission maps are used to extract spatially\nresolved SEDs, which are then fit independently with modified blackbody curves\nto obtain line-of-sight-averaged dust temperature and column density maps. We\nfind that the thermal structure of all globules is dominated by external\nheating from the interstellar radiation field and moderate shielding by thin\nextended halos. All globules have warm outer envelopes (14-20 K) and colder\ndense interiors (8-12 K). The protostars embedded in some of the globules raise\nthe local temperature of the dense cores only within radii out to about 5000\nAU, but do not significantly affect the overall thermal balance of the\nglobules.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Jan 2013 11:36:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

Very important parameters\ndetermining the structure of disks, and hence the direction of migration, are\nthe viscosity and the adiabatic index. In this paper we investigate the\ninfluence of different viscosity prescriptions (alpha-type and constant) and\nadiabatic indices on disk structures and how this affects the migration rate of\nplanets embedded in such disks. We perform 3D numerical simulations of\naccretion disks with embedded planets. We use the explicit/implicit\nhydrodynamical code NIRVANA that includes full tensor viscosity and radiation\ntransport in the flux-limited diffusion approximation, as well as a proper\nequation of state for molecular hydrogen. The migration of embedded 20Earthmass\nplanets is studied. Low-viscosity disks have cooler temperatures and the\nmigration rates of embedded planets tend toward the isothermal limit. In these\ndisks, planets migrate inwards even in the fully radiative case. The effect of\noutward migration can only be sustained if the viscosity in the disk is large.\nOverall, the differences between the treatments for the equation of state seem\nto play a more important role in disks with higher viscosity. A change in the\nadiabatic index and in the viscosity changes the zero-torque radius that\nseparates inward from outward migration. For larger viscosities, temperatures\nin the disk become higher and the zero-torque radius moves to larger radii,\nallowing outward migration of a 20 Earth-mass planet to persist over an\nextended radial range. In combination with large disk masses, this may allow\nfor an extended period of the outward migration of growing protoplanetary\ncores.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Jan 2013 12:48:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-09"}

With the right\nfrequency and amplitude the heating can be enough to initiate a detonation,\nwhich can propagate backward and up the density gradient. We studied planar and\nspherical geometry. In the planar case we made a parametric study of the\nfrequency and amplitude. We found it possible to obtain a detonation for\nperturbations down to Mach number M=0.003.
