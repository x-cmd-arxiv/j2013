If a\ntransaction aborts, none of its instructions can affect other transactions.\n  The popular criterion of \\emph{opacity} requires that the views of aborted\ntransactions must also be consistent with the global sequential order\nconstituted by committed ones. This is believed to be important, since\ninconsistencies observed by an aborted transaction may cause a fatal\nirrecoverable error or waste of the system in an infinite loop. Intuitively, an\nopaque implementation must ensure that no intermediate view a transaction\nobtains before it commits or aborts can be affected by a transaction that has\nnot started committing yet, so called \\emph{deferred-update} semantics.\n  In this paper, we intend to grasp this intuition formally. We propose a\nvariant of opacity that explicitly requires the sequential order to respect the\ndeferred-update semantics.

In this paper, we analyze density evolution for\nprotograph LDPC codes over the binary erasure channel and show that their\nbit-error probability decreases double exponentially with the number of\niterations when the erasure probability is below the bit-error threshold and\nlong chain of degree-two variable nodes are avoided in the protograph. We\npresent deterministic constructions of such protograph LDPC codes with girth\nlogarithmic in blocklength, resulting in an exponential fall in bit-error\nprobability below the threshold. We provide optimized protographs, whose\nblock-error thresholds are better than that of the standard ensemble with\nminimum bit-node degree three. These protograph LDPC codes are theoretically of\ngreat interest, and have applications, for instance, in coding with strong\nsecrecy over wiretap channels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Jan 2013 00:17:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 3 Feb 2013 09:28:03 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 21 May 2013 05:17:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-22"}

Hence, it\nis well suited for resource-constrained wireless sensor networks. However, in\npractical cases where sensors observe discrete-time signals, the random\novershoot above or below the sampling thresholds considerably degrades the\nperformance of the considered detector. We propose, for systems with stringent\nenergy constraints, a novel approach to tackle this problem by encoding the\novershoot into the time delay between the sampling time and the transmission\ntime. Specifically, each sensor computes the local log-likelihood ratio (LLR)\nand samples it using level-triggered sampling. Then, it transmits a single\npulse to the fusion center (FC) after a transmission delay that is proportional\nto the overshoot, as in pulse position modulation (PPM). The FC, upon receiving\na bit decodes the corresponding overshoot and recovers the transmitted LLR\nvalue. It then updates the approximate global LLR and compares it with two\nthreshold to either make a decision or to continue the sequential process. We\nanalyze the asymptotic average detection delay performance of the proposed\nscheme. We then apply the proposed sequential scheme to target detection in\nwireless sensor networks under the four Swerling fluctuating target models. It\nis seen that the proposed sequential distributed detector offers significant\nperformance advantage over conventional decision fusion techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Jan 2013 02:59:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 22 Sep 2013 18:19:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 21 Jan 2014 17:09:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

With the a priori\nknowledge of suspect nodes and an observation of infected nodes, we construct a\nmaximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator to identify the rumor source using the\nsusceptible-infected (SI) model. The a priori suspect set and its associated\nconnectivity bring about new ingredients to the problem, and thus we propose to\nuse local rumor center, a generalized concept based on rumor centrality, to\nidentify the source from suspects. For regular tree-type networks of node\ndegree {\\delta}, we characterize Pc(n), the correct detection probability of\nthe estimator upon observing n infected nodes, in both the finite and\nasymptotic regimes.

In particular, it\ncompares two methods of transformation: the \"potential-moving\" approach most\nused in the period 1975-1980 and the \"rewiring method\" as it has been developed\nin the last five years. These methods both employ a parameter, called \\chi,\nthat measures the complexity of the localized stochastic variable forming the\nbasis of the analysis. Both methods are here exemplified by calculations in\nterms of fixed points for the smallest possible values of \\chi. These\ncalculations describe three models for two-dimensional systems: The Ising model\nsolved by Onsager, the tricritical point of that model, and the three-state\nPotts model. The older method, often described as lower bound renormalization\ntheory, provides a heuristic method giving reasonably accurate results for\ncritical indices at the lowest degree of complexity, i.e. \\chi=2. In contrast,\nthe rewiring method, employing \"singular value decomposition\", does not perform\nas well for low \\chi values but offers an error that apparently decreases\nslowly toward zero as \\chi is increased. It appears likely that no such\nimprovement occurs in the older approach.\n  A detailed comparison of the two methods is performed, with a particular eye\nto describing the reasons why they are so different. For example, the old\nmethod quite naturally employed fixed points for its analysis; these are hard\nto use in the newer approach. A discussion is given of why the fixed point\napproach proves to be hard in this context.\n  In the new approach the calculated the thermal critical indices are\nsatisfactory for the smallest values of \\chi but hardly improve as \\chi is\nincreased, while the magnetic critical indices do not agree well with the known\ntheoretical values.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Jan 2013 06:41:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

It is shown that to\nimplement the possible effect of space weather on the terrestrial harvests and\nprices, a simultaneous fulfillment of three conditions is required: 1)\nsensitivity of local weather (cloud cover, atmospheric circulation) to the\nstate of space weather; 2) sensitivity of the area of specific agricultural\ncrops to the weather anomalies (belonging to the area of risk farming); 3)\nrelative isolation of the market, making it difficult to damp the price hikes\nby the external food supplies. Four possible scenarios of the market response\nto the modulations of local terrestrial weather via the solar activity are\ndescribed. The data sources and analysis methods applied to detect this\nrelationship are characterized. We describe the behavior of 22 European markets\nduring the medieval period, in particular, during the Maunder minimum\n(1650-1715).
