In the relativistic heavy ion accelerators, specially\nthe RHIC and LHC colliders, it became possible to study not only fluids made of\nhadronic matter but also fluids of quarks and gluons. Part of the physics\nprogram of these machines is the observation of waves in this strongly\ninteracting medium. From the theoretical point of view, these waves are often\ntreated with li-nearized hydrodynamics. In this text we review the attempts to\ngo beyond linearization. We show how to use the Reductive Perturbation Method\nto expand the equations of (ideal and viscous) relativistic hydrodynamics to\nobtain nonlinear wave equations. These nonlinear wave equations govern the\nevolution of energy density perturbations (in hot quark gluon plasma) or baryon\ndensity perturbations (in cold quark gluon plasma and nuclear matter).\nDifferent nonlinear wave equations, such as the breaking wave, Korteweg-de\nVries and Burgers equations, are obtained from different equations of state\n(EOS). In nuclear matter, the Walecka EOS may lead to a KdV equation. We\nexplore equations of state such as those extracted from the MIT Bag Model and\nfrom QCD in the mean field theory approach. Some of these equations are\nintegrable and have analytical solitonic solutions. We derive these equations\nalso in spherical and cylindrical coordinates.

The topological spin $\\theta_a=2\\pi h_a$ is an\nimportant property of a topological quasi-particle, which is the Berry phase\nobtained in the adiabatic self-rotation of the quasi-particle by $2\\pi$. For\nchiral topological states with robust chiral edge states, another fundamental\ntopological property is the edge state chiral central charge $c$. In this paper\nwe propose a new approach to compute the topological spin and chiral central\ncharge in lattice models by defining a new quantity named as the momentum\npolarization. Momentum polarization is defined on the cylinder geometry as a\nuniversal subleading term in the average value of a \"partial translation\noperator\". We show that the momentum polarization is a quantum entanglement\nproperty which can be computed from the reduced density matrix, and our\nanalytic derivation based on edge conformal field theory shows that the\nmomentum polarization measures the combination $h_a-\\frac{c}{24}$ of\ntopological spin and central charge.

Lower bounds on\nthe two metrics under this model were derived previously; it has also been\nshown that these bounds are achievable for the amount of data-read and download\nwhen d=n-1, and for the amount of download alone when d<n-1.\n  In this paper, we complete this picture by proving the converse result, that\nwhen d<n-1, these lower bounds are strictly loose with respect to the amount of\nread required. The proof is information-theoretic, and hence applies to\nnon-linear codes as well. We also show that under two (practical) relaxations\nof the problem setting, these lower bounds can be met for both read and\ndownload simultaneously.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Dec 2012 19:22:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Apr 2013 05:49:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-15"}

Specifically, we find any\nnumber of vector-like messenger fields (allowed by GUT unification) compress\nthe predicted gaugino spectrum when their masses come from the Giudice-Masiero\nmechanism. This more compressed spectrum is less constrained by LHC searches\nand allows for lighter gluinos. In addition to the model, we present gaugino\npole mass equations that differ from (and correct) the original literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Dec 2012 20:34:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

The new design of the trap consisted of an array of microtraps\nwith substantially lower end electrodes potential than conventional\nPenning-Malmberg traps, which makes this trap quite portable.

A lot of\nresearch works have been done to address part of these problems, such as\nphotonics technology for bandwidth, 3D stacking for capacity, and NVM for power\nas well as many micro-architecture level innovations. Many of them need a\nmodification of current memory architecture, since the decades-old synchronous\nmemory architecture (SDRAM) has become an obstacle to adopt those advances.\nHowever, to the best of our knowledge, none of them is able to provide a\nuniversal memory interface that is scalable enough to cover all these problems.\n  In this paper, we argue that a message-based interface should be adopted to\nreplace the traditional bus-based interface in memory system. A novel message\ninterface based memory system (MIMS) is proposed. The key innovation of MIMS is\nthat processor and memory system communicate through a universal and flexible\nmessage interface. Each message packet could contain multiple memory requests\nor commands along with various semantic information. The memory system is more\nintelligent and active by equipping with a local buffer scheduler, which is\nresponsible to process packet, schedule memory requests, and execute specific\ncommands with the help of semantic information. The experimental results by\nsimulator show that, with accurate granularity message, the MIMS would improve\nperformance by 53.21%, while reducing energy delay product (EDP) by 55.90%, the\neffective bandwidth utilization is improving by 62.42%.

This thus shows\nthat, contrary to the established theory, bubble selection in a Hele-Shaw cell\ndoes not require surface tension.

In the present work, we track the H$_2$ mass fraction within our\ncosmological smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code GADGET-3 using an\nequilibrium analytic model by Krumholz et al. This model allows us to regulate\nthe star formation in our simulation by the local abundance of H$_2$ rather\nthan the total cold gas density, and naturally introduce the dependence of star\nformation on metallicity. We investigate implications of the equilibrium\nH$_2$-based SF model on galaxy population properties, such as the\nstellar-to-halo mass ratio (SHMR), baryon fraction, cosmic star formation rate\ndensity (SFRD), galaxy specific SFR, galaxy stellar mass functions (GSMF), and\nKennicutt-Schmidt (KS) relationship. The advantage of our work over the\nprevious ones is having a large sample of simulated galaxies in a cosmological\nvolume from high-redshift to $z=0$. We find that low-mass halos with\nM$_{DM}<10^{10.5}$ M$_\\odot$ are less efficient in producing stars in the\nH$_2$-based SF model at $z\\geq6$, which brings the simulations to a better\nagreement with observational estimates of SHMR and GSMF at the low-mass end.\nThis is particularly evident by a reduction in the number of low-mass galaxies\nat M$_\\star\\leq10^{8}$ M$_\\odot$ in the GSMF. The overall SFRD is also reduced\nat high-$z$ in the H$_2$ run, which results in slightly higher SFRD at\nlow-redshift due to more abundant gas available for star formation at later\ntimes.

The important case of $F$-minimization has\nbecome of particular interest, for which the exact reconstruction condition\n(ERC) in the noiseless setting can be precisely characterized by the null space\nproperty (NSP). However, little work has been done concerning its robust\nreconstruction condition (RRC) in the noisy setting. We look at the null space\nof the measurement matrix as a point on the Grassmann manifold, and then study\nthe relation between the ERC and RRC sets, denoted as $\\Omega_J$ and\n$\\Omega_J^r$, respectively. It is shown that $\\Omega_J^r$ is the interior of\n$\\Omega_J$, from which a previous result of the equivalence of ERC and RRC for\n$\\ell_p$-minimization follows easily as a special case. Moreover, when $F$ is\nnon-decreasing, it is shown that\n$\\overline{\\Omega}_J\\setminus\\interior(\\Omega_J)$ is a set of measure zero and\nof the first category. As a consequence, the probabilities of ERC and RRC are\nthe same if the measurement matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ is randomly generated according\nto a continuous distribution.

This symmetry was studied in weak\ninteraction where it is fully violated, but it is poorly known in the strong\nand electromagnetic interactions.\n  To this end, in this thesis we investigated eta->pi+pi-pi0 and eta->pi0 e+e-\ndecays, which might violate charge conjugation symmetry. The violation of C\nsymmetry in eta->pi+pi-pi0 process could manifest itself as an asymmetry\nbetween energy spectra of charged pions. The eta->pi0 e+e- decay is forbidden\nby C symmetry in the first order of electromagnetic interaction, with the\nbranching ratio on a level of 10^-8. Therefore, observation of a larger\nbranching ratio could indicate a mechanism involving first order\nelectromagnetic interaction violating charge conjugation.\n  Both decays were investigated by means of the WASA-at-COSY detector operating\nat the COSY synchrotron at the Forchungszentrum Julich in Germany. The eta\nmeson was produced via pp->pp eta reaction at the proton beam momentum of\n2.14GeV/c. In total around 5x10^7 eta mesons were collected.\n  As a result of the analysis conducted in the framework of this thesis a\nDalitz Plot distribution for the eta->pi+pi-pi0 decay was obtained. From this\ndistribution we extracted asymmetry parameters sensitive to C symmetry\nviolation for different isospin values of the final state and we have\nestablished that all are consistent with zero within the obtained accuracy.\n  For the eta->pi0 e+e- decay we have not observe signal and thus we estimated\nan upper limit for the branching ratio. The established upper limit amounts to\n$BR(eta->pi0 e+e-)<3.7x10^-5 at the 90% confidence level.

Quantum energy\nteleportation (QET) is protocols for extraction of the zero-point energy out of\none subsystem using information of a remote measurement of another subsystem.\nFrom an operational viewpoint of protocol users, QET can be regarded as an\neffective rapid energy transportation without breaking all physical laws\nincluding causality and local energy conservation.
