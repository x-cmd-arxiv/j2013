In such systems, the same d- or\nf-electrons tend to form magnetically ordered states and participate in\nbuilding up a high density of states at the Fermi level, which is responsible\nfor the superconductivity. Charge-density-wave (CDW) is another fascinating\ncollective quantum phenomenon in some low dimensional materials, like the\nprototypical transition-metal poly-chalcogenides, in which CDW instability is\nfrequently found to accompany with superconducting transition at low\ntemperatures. Remarkably, similar to the antiferromagnetic superconductors,\nsuperconductivity can also be achieved upon suppression of CDW order via\nchemical doping or applied pressure in 1T-TiSe2. However, in these CDW\nsuperconductors, the two ground states are believed to occur in different parts\nof Fermi surface (FS) sheets, derived mainly from chalcogen p-states and\ntransition metal d-states, respectively.

In ITER-type fusion reactors, such\npopulations can be generated by fusion reactions or auxiliary heating. The\nelectron-driven fishbone mode results from the resonant interaction of the\ninternal kink mode with the slow toroidal precessional motion of energetic\nelectrons and is frequently observed in present-day tokamaks with Electron\nCyclotron Resonance Heating or Lower Hybrid Current Drive. In Tore Supra,\nelectron-driven fishbones are observed during LHCD-powered discharges in which\na high-energy tail of the electronic distribution function is created. Although\nthe destabilization of those modes is related to the existence of a fast\nparticle population, the modes are observed at a frequency that is lower than\nexpected. The linear stability analysis of electron-driven fishbone modes is\nthe main focus of this thesis. The fishbone dispersion relation is derived in a\nform that accounts for the contribution of the parallel motion of passing\nparticles to the resonance condition. The MIKE code is developed to compute and\nsolve the dispersion relation of electron-driven fishbones. The code is\nsuccessfully benchmarked against theory using simple analytical distributions.\nUsing the code MIKE with parametric distributions and equilibria, we show that\nboth barely trapped and barely passing electrons resonate with the mode and can\ndrive it unstable. More deeply trapped and passing electrons have a\nnon-resonant effect on the mode that is, respectively, stabilizing and\ndestabilizing. MIKE simulations using complete ECRH-like distribution functions\nshow that energetic barely passing electrons can contribute to drive a mode\nunstable at a relatively low frequency.

Stars are more often found in\nmultiple systems, the more massive they are. A complete knowledge of the\nmultiplicity of high-mass stars over the full range of orbit separations is\nthus essential to understand their still debated formation process.\nObservations of the Orion Nebula Cluster can help to answer the question about\nthe origin and evolution of multiple stars. Earlier studies provide a good\nknowledge about the multiplicity of the stars at very small (spectroscopic) and\nlarge separations (AO, speckle) and thus make the ONC a good target for such a\nproject. We used the NIR interferometric instrument AMBER at VLTI to observe a\nsample of bright stars in the ONC.

Our observations resolve the known multiple systems\n\\theta 1 Ori C and \\theta 1 Ori A and provide new orbit points, which confirm\nthe predicted orbit and the determined stellar parameters for \\theta 1 Ori C.\nCombining AMBER and NACO data for \\theta 1 Ori A we were able to follow the\nmotion of the companion from 2003 to 2011. We furthermore find hints for a\ncompanion around \\theta 1 Ori D and a previously unknown companion to NU Ori.\nWith a probability of ~90% we can exclude further companions with masses of > 3\nMsun around our sample stars for separations between ~2 mas and ~110 mas. We\nconclude that the companion around \\theta 1 Ori A is most likely physically\nrelated to the primary star. The newly discovered possible companions further\nincrease the multiplicity in the ONC. For our sample of two O and three B-type\nstars we find on average 2.5 known companions per primary, which is around five\ntimes more than for low-mass stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Jan 2013 16:37:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

The lack of knowledge of photospheric parameters and the level of\nchromospheric activity in young low-mass pre-main sequence stars introduces\nuncertainties when measuring mass accretion rates in accreting (Class II) Young\nStellar Objects. A detailed investigation of the effect of chromospheric\nemission on the estimates of mass accretion rate in young low-mass stars is\nstill missing. This can be undertaken using samples of young diskless (Class\nIII) K and M-type stars. Aims. Our goal is to measure the chromospheric\nactivity of Class III pre main sequence stars to determine its effect on the\nestimates of accretion luminosity (Lacc) and mass accretion rate (Macc) in\nyoung stellar objects with disks. Methods. Using VLT/X-Shooter spectra we have\nanalyzed a sample of 24 non-accreting young stellar objects of spectral type\nbetween K5 and M9.5. We identify the main emission lines normally used as\ntracers of accretion in Class II objects, and we determine their fluxes in\norder to estimate the contribution of the chromospheric activity to the line\nluminosity. Results. We have used the relationships between line luminosity and\naccretion luminosity derived in the literature for Class II objects to evaluate\nthe impact of chromospheric activity on the accretion rate measurements. We\nfind that the typical chromospheric activity would bias the derived accretion\nluminosity by Lacc,noise< 10-3Lsun, with a strong dependence with the Teff of\nthe objects. The noise on Macc depends on stellar mass and age, and the typical\nvalues of log(Macc,noise) range between -9.2 to -11.6Msun/yr. Conclusions.\nValues of Lacc< 10-3Lsun obtained in accreting low-mass pre main sequence stars\nthrough line luminosity should be treated with caution as the line emission may\nbe dominated by the contribution of chromospheric activity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Jan 2013 17:03:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

Powerful AGN jets transform the central\ngalaxies into red extended and dispersion-dominated galaxies. This\nmorphological transformation of disc galaxies into elliptical galaxies is\ndriven by the efficient quenching of the in situ star formation due to AGN\nfeedback, which transform these galaxies into systems built up by accretion.\nFor galaxies mainly formed by accretion, the proportion of stars deposited\nfarther away from the centre increases, and galaxies have larger sizes.

The spin-flip scattering is\ncharacterized by its dependence on the incident and scattered light\npolarization as well as on the magnetic field strength and orientation. Model\nschemes of electric-dipole allowed spin-flip Raman processes in the exciton\ncomplexes are compared to the experimental observations, from which we find\nthat lowering of the exciton symmetry, time of carrier spin relaxation, and\nmixing between electron states and, respectively, light- and heavy-hole states\nplay an essential role in the scattering. At the exciton resonance, anisotropic\nexchange interaction induces heavy-hole spin-flip scattering, while acoustic\nphonon interaction is mainly responsible for the electron spin-flip. In\nresonance with the positively and negatively charged excitons, anisotropic\nelectron-hole exchange as well as mixed electron states allow spin-flip\nscattering. Variations in the resonant excitation energy and lattice\ntemperature demonstrate that localization of resident electrons and holes\ncontrols the Raman process probability and is also responsible for symmetry\nreduction. We show that the intensity of the electron spin-flip scattering is\nstrongly affected by the lifetime of the exciton complex and in tilted magnetic\nfields by the angular dependence of the anisotropic electron-hole exchange\ninteraction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Jan 2013 20:02:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 16 Mar 2013 18:43:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

During the time lapse, 10807 independent measurements of the\nsolar diameter were made, Eastwards and Westwards from the local meridian and\nevenly distributed. An image treatment has been devised to account for the\ncamera dark current and flat field, using IRAF routines. A study of the\nobservational conditions upon the final outcome was made. The mean temperature\nat the observation is shown as the most influential parameter upon the final\nresult. Next to it also the temperature variation, the Fried's factor, and the\nstandard deviation of the reflected parabola presented a minor and complex\ndegree of influence. The derived corrections are of the order of hundredths of\narc seconds, thus being tenfold smaller than the typical error of one\nobservation.

In the realistic scenario, where the hot gas is\ncooling, while heated and stirred on large scales, the accretion rate is\nboosted up to two orders of magnitude compared with the Bondi prediction. The\ncause is the nonlinear growth of thermal instabilities, leading to the\ncondensation of cold clouds and filaments when t_cool/t_ff < 10. Subsonic\nturbulence of just over 100 km/s (M > 0.2) induces the formation of thermal\ninstabilities, even in the absence of heating, while in the transonic regime\nturbulent dissipation inhibits their growth (t_turb/t_cool < 1). When heating\nrestores global thermodynamic balance, the formation of the multiphase medium\nis violent, and the mode of accretion is fully cold and chaotic. The recurrent\ncollisions and tidal forces between clouds, filaments and the central clumpy\ntorus promote angular momentum cancellation, hence boosting accretion. On\nsub-pc scales the clouds are channelled to the very centre via a funnel. A good\napproximation to the accretion rate is the cooling rate, which can be used as\nsubgrid model, physically reproducing the boost factor of 100 required by\ncosmological simulations, while accounting for fluctuations. Chaotic cold\naccretion may be common in many systems, such as hot galactic halos, groups,\nand clusters, generating high-velocity clouds and strong variations of the AGN\nluminosity and jet orientation. In this mode, the black hole can quickly react\nto the state of the entire host galaxy, leading to efficient self-regulated AGN\nfeedback and the symbiotic Magorrian relation. During phases of overheating,\nthe hot mode becomes the single channel of accretion (with a different cuspy\ntemperature profile), though strongly suppressed by turbulence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Jan 2013 21:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Apr 2013 21:42:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

In this paper, we introduce an architecture for real-time\nvideo transmission over multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless\ncommunication systems using loss visibility side information. We quantify the\nperceptual importance of a packet through the packet loss visibility and use\nthe loss visibility distribution to provide a notion of relative packet\nimportance. To jointly achieve video quality and low latency, we define the\noptimization objective function as the throughput weighted by the loss\nvisibility of each packet, a proxy for the total perceptual value of successful\npackets per unit time. We solve the problem of mapping video packets to MIMO\nsubchannels and adapting per-stream rates to maximize the proposed objective.\nWe show that the solution enables jointly reaping gains in terms of improved\nvideo quality and lower latency. Optimized packet-stream mapping enables\ntransmission of more relevant packets over more reliable streams while unequal\nmodulation opportunistically increases the transmission rate on the stronger\nstreams to enable low latency delivery of high priority packets. We extend the\nsolution to capture codebook-based limited feedback and MIMO mode adaptation.\nResults show that the composite quality and throughput gains are significant\nunder full channel state information as well as limited feedback. Tested on\nH.264-encoded video sequences, for a 4x4 MIMO with 3 spatial streams, the\nproposed architecture achieves 8 dB power reduction for the same video quality\nand supports 2.4x higher throughput due to unequal modulation.

Protoplanet migration models generally assume disk masses\nlow enough that the disk's self-gravity can be neglected. However, disk\ninstability requires a disk massive enough to be marginally gravitationally\nunstable (MGU). Even for core accretion, a FU Orionis outburst may require a\nbrief MGU disk phase. We present a new set of three dimensional, gravitational\nradiation hydrodynamics models of MGU disks with multiple protoplanets, which\ninteract gravitationally with the disk and with each other, including disk gas\nmass accretion. Initial protoplanet masses are 0.01 to 10 $M_\\oplus$ for core\naccretion models, and 0.1 to 3 $M_{Jup}$ for Nice scenario models, starting on\ncircular orbits with radii of 6, 8, 10, or 12 AU, inside a 0.091 $M_\\odot$ disk\nextending from 4 to 20 AU around a $1 M_\\odot$ protostar.

The code is based on the so-called Riccati method, a\nnumerical algorithm that has been successfully applied to a variety of stellar\npulsators, and which doesn't suffer of the major drawbacks of commonly used\nshooting and relaxation schemes. Here we present an extension of the Riccati\nmethod to investigate dynamic tides in close binaries.

In theory, torque exchange between these moons and\nring particles leads to radial drift. We predict that moons with Hill radii r_H\n~ 2-24 km should migrate through the A ring in 1000 yr. In this size range,\nmoons orbiting in an empty gap or in a full ring eventually migrate at the same\nrate. Smaller moons or moonlets -- such as the propellers (e.g., Tiscareno et\nal. 2006) -- are trapped by diffusion of disk material into corotating orbits,\ncreating inertial drag. Larger moons -- such as Pan or Atlas -- do not migrate\nbecause of their own inertia. Fast migration of 2-24 km moons should eliminate\nintermediate-size bodies from the A ring and may be responsible for the\nobserved large-radius cutoff of r_H ~ 1-2 km in the size distribution of the A\nring's propeller moonlets. Although the presence of Daphnis (r_H ~ 5 km) inside\nthe Keeler gap challenges this scenario, numerical simulations demonstrate that\norbital resonances and stirring by distant, larger moons (e.g., Mimas) may be\nimportant factors. For Daphnis, stirring by distant moons seems the most\npromising mechanism to halt fast migration. Alternatively, Daphnis may be a\nrecent addition to the ring that is settling into a low inclination orbit in\n~10^3 yr prior to a phase of rapid migration.

This paper presents a novel low-complexity encoding algorithm\nfor quasi-cyclic (QC) codes based on matrix transformation. First, a message\nvector is encoded into a transformed codeword in the transform domain. Then,\nthe transmitted codeword is obtained from the transformed codeword by the\ninverse Galois Fourier transform. For binary QC codes, a simple and fast\nmapping is required to post-process the transformed codeword such that the\ntransmitted codeword is binary as well.

Comparing the results with those of the random phase\napproximation or the fluctuation exchange approximation in which vertex\ncorrections are ignored, we discuss how the vertex corrections affect the\npairing instability of La$_2$CuO$_4$ and the dominant pairing symmetry of\nLaFeAsO.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Jan 2013 07:55:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-16"}

The function\nunderlying the inferred strong constraint appears to be separate from splicing\nenhancers, nucleosome positioning, and the translational optimization\ngenerating canonical codon bias. The fraction of synonymous sites under strong\nconstraint within a gene correlates well with gene expression, particularly in\nthe mid-late embryo, pupae, and adult developmental stages. Genes enriched in\nstrongly constrained synonymous sites tend to be particularly functionally\nimportant and are often involved in key developmental pathways.

While PPM and its variations have great advantages in many contexts,\nthis type of modulation is vulnerable to loss of synchronization, potentially\ncausing a severe error floor or throughput penalty even when little or no noise\nis assumed. Another disadvantage is that this type of modulation typically\noffers no error correction mechanism on its own, making them sensitive to\nintersymbol interference and environmental noise. In this paper we propose a\ncoding theoretic variation of PPM that allows for significantly more efficient\nsymbol and frame synchronization as well as strong error correction. The\nproposed scheme can be divided into a synchronization layer and a modulation\nlayer. This makes our technique compatible with major existing techniques such\nas standard PPM, multipluse PPM, and expurgated PPM as well in that the scheme\ncan be realized by adding a simple synchronization layer to one of these\nstandard techniques. We also develop a generalization of expurgated PPM suited\nfor the modulation layer of the proposed self-synchronizing modulation scheme.\nThis generalized PPM can also be used as stand-alone error-correcting PPM with\na larger number of available symbols.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Jan 2013 14:51:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 5 May 2013 03:19:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-20"}

With respect to\nvariations of the observed profiles with 35 d phase, we find that there is a\nclear evolution of the shape of the pulse profiles (flux versus pulse phase), a\nmoderate increase of the maximum cyclotron line energy (found around pulse\nphase 0.7), but no significant evolution of the shape of the pulse phase\nprofiles of the cyclotron line energy, the spectral power law index or the iron\nline intensity. The variation of spectral parameters as a function of the pulse\nphase provides important information about the system: 1. the disappearance of\nthe Fe line flux near the highest continuum flux may be an indication of a\nhollow cone geometry of the accretion structure; ii. the apparent\nnon-dependence of the cyclotron line energy profiles on 35 d phase provides a\nnew possibility to test the model of free precession of the neutron star,\nproposed to be responsible for the systematic variations in the pulse profiles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Jan 2013 15:10:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

These near-infrared observations are vital for determining the\nenergy budgets of hot Jupiters, since they probe the planet's spectral energy\ndistribution near its peak. The aim of this work is to measure the Ks-band\nsecondary eclipse depth of WASP-33b, the first planet discovered to transit an\nA-type star. This planet receives the highest level of irradiation of all\ntransiting planets discovered to date. Furthermore, its host-star shows\npulsations and is classified as a low-amplitude delta-Scuti. As part of our\nGROUnd-based Secondary Eclipse (GROUSE) project we have obtained observations\nof two separate secondary eclipses of WASP-33b in the Ks-band using the LIRIS\ninstrument on the William Herschel Telescope (WHT). The telescope was\nsignificantly defocused to avoid saturation of the detector for this bright\nstar (K~7.5). To increase the stability and the cadence of the observations,\nthey were performed in staring mode. We collected a total of 5100 and 6900\nframes for the first and the second night respectively, both with an average\ncadence of 3.3 seconds. On the second night the eclipse is detected at the\n12-sigma level, with a measured eclipse depth of 0.244+0.027-0.020 %. This\neclipse depth corresponds to a brightness temperature of 3270+115-160 K. The\nmeasured brightness temperature on the second night is consistent with the\nexpected equilibrium temperature for a planet with a very low albedo and a\nrapid re-radiation of the absorbed stellar light. For the other night the short\nout-of-eclipse baseline prevents good corrections for the stellar pulsations\nand systematic effects, which makes this dataset unreliable for eclipse depth\nmeasurements. This demonstrates the need of getting a sufficient out-of-eclipse\nbaseline.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Jan 2013 15:14:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-16"}
