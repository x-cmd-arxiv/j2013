Abell 3376 is a nearby\n(z=0.046) massive galaxy cluster whose bullet-shaped X-ray emission indicates\nthat it may have undergone a recent collision. It displays a pair of Mpc-scale\nradio relics and its brightest cluster galaxy is located 970 h_70^-1 kpc away\nfrom the peak of X-ray emission, where the second brightest galaxy lies. We\nattempt to recover the dynamical history of Abell 3376. We perform a set of\nN-body adiabatic hydrodynamical simulations using the SPH code Gadget-2. These\nsimulations of binary cluster collisions are aimed at exploring the parameter\nspace of possible initial configurations. By attempting to match X-ray\nmorphology, temperature, virial mass and X-ray luminosity, we set approximate\nconstraints on some merger parameters. Our best models suggest a collision of\nclusters with mass ratio in the range 1/6-1/8, and having a subcluster with\ncentral gas density four times higher than that of the major cluster. Models\nwith small impact parameter (b<150 kpc), if any, are preferred.

The coated\nconductors were characterized in the pristine state and after irradiation to\nthe ITER design fluence.

We perform extensive\nsimulations to quantify the dropout-selection completenesses and measurement\nbiases and uncertainties in two-dimensional size and magnitude bins, and\ntransform the theoretical size-luminosity distribution to the expected\ndistribution for the observed data. Using maximum-likelihood estimator (MLE),\nwe find that the Schechter function parameters for B-dropouts are\n\\alpha=-1.68^{+0.068}_{-0.095}, M*=-20.60^{+0.13}_{-0.17}, and\n\\phi*=1.79^{+0.32}_{-0.52} x 10^{-3} Mpc^{-3}.

In this type of model, the elasticity of the\nnetwork derives from the entropic changes arising from a displacement of the\nnetwork junction positions. The shortcoming of this approach is clear from the\nobservation that unswollen rubbery materials are nearly incompressible,\nreflecting the existence of strong intermolecular interactions that restrict\nthe polymer chains to an exploration of their local tube-like molecular\nenvironments. The imposition of a deformation of these solid rubbery materials\nthen necessitates a consideration of how the local molecular packing\nconstraints become modified under deformation and the impact of these changes\non the macroscopic elasticity of the material as a whole. Many researchers have\nstruggled with this difficult problem, in the present paper we focus on the\nsimple localization model of rubber elasticity of Gaylord and Douglas, which\nprovides a simple minimal model for the network elasticity of rubbers having\nstrong intermolecular interactions in the dense polymer state. Particular\nemphasis is given in the implications of this model in describing how network\nelasticity changes with swelling by a solvent, a phenomenon where large\ndeviations from classical elasticity have been observed and a situation\nrelevant to numerous applications involving rubbery materials. We also discuss\nthe nature of entanglement based on the same packing picture and deduce general\nrelationships for entanglement in terms of molecular parameters and we find\nthat our predictions accord with recent experimental correlations relating\nchain molecular structure to the entanglement molecular mass\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Jan 2013 18:15:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-21"}

However, the\ntypical L* satellite galaxy resides in much lower mass galaxy groups, where the\nprocesses capable of altering their evolution are generally weaker and have had\nless time to operate. To investigate the extent to which satellite and central\ngalaxy evolution differs, we separately model the stellar mass - halo mass (M*\n-Mh) relation for these two populations over the redshift interval 0 < z < 1.\nThis relation for central galaxies is constrained by the galaxy stellar mass\nfunction while the relation for satellite galaxies is constrained against\nrecent measurements of the galaxy two-point correlation function (2PCF). At z ~\n0 the satellites, on average, have ~10% larger stellar masses at fixed peak\nsubhalo mass compared to central galaxies of the same halo mass.

This allows for an abstract formulation and programming of\ninference algorithms, including those derived within information field theory.\nThus, NIFTY permits its user to rapidly prototype algorithms in 1D, and then\napply the developed code in higher-dimensional settings of real world problems.\nThe set of spaces on which NIFTY operates comprises point sets, n-dimensional\nregular grids, spherical spaces, their harmonic counterparts, and product\nspaces constructed as combinations of those. The functionality and diversity of\nthe package is demonstrated by a Wiener filter code example that successfully\nruns without modification regardless of the space on which the inference\nproblem is defined.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Jan 2013 21:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 5 Jun 2013 17:24:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-06"}

It has been suggested that this accretion proceeds along narrow\nstreams that might also directly drive the turbulence in galactic gas,\ndynamical disturbances, and bulge formation. In cosmological simulations,\nhowever, it is impossible to isolate and hence disentangle the effect of\naccretion from internal instabilities and mergers. Moreover, in most\ncosmological simulations, the phase structure and turbulence in the ISM arising\nfrom stellar feedback are treated in a sub-grid manner, so that feedback cannot\ngenerate ISM turbulence. In this paper we therefore test the effects of cold\nstreams in extremely high-resolution simulations of otherwise isolated galaxy\ndisks using detailed models for star formation and feedback; we then include or\nexclude mock cold flows falling onto the galaxies with accretion rates,\nvelocities and geometry set to maximize their effect on the disk. We find: (1)\nTurbulent velocity dispersions in gas disks are identical with or without the\ncold flow; the energy injected by the flow is dissipated where it meets the\ndisk. (2) In runs without stellar feedback, the presence of a cold flow has\nessentially no effect on runaway local collapse, resulting in star formation\nrates (SFRs) that are far too large. (3) Disks in runs with feedback and cold\nflows have higher SFRs, but only insofar as they have more gas. (4) Because\nflows are extended relative to the disk, they do not trigger strong resonant\nresponses and so induce weak morphological perturbation (bulge formation via\ninstabilities is not accelerated). (5) However, flows can thicken the disk by\ndirect contribution of out-of-plane streams. We conclude that while inflows are\ncritical over cosmological timescales to determine the supply and angular\nmomentum of gas disks, they have weak instantaneous dynamical effects on\ngalaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Jan 2013 21:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Jul 2013 10:02:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-13"}

The proximity postulate manifestly contradicts\nthe idea that interior information is redundant with information in Hawking\nradiation, which is very far from the black hole.

Because of their large day-night temperature differences,\ncondensable species that are stable in the gas phase on the dayside, such as\nTiO and silicates, may condense and gravitationally settle on the nightside.\nAtmospheric circulation may counterbalance this tendency to gravitationally\nsettle. This three dimensional (3D) mixing of chemical species has not\npreviously been studied for hot Jupiters, yet it is crucial to assess the\nexistence and distribution of TiO and silicates in the atmospheres of these\nplanets. We perform 3D global circulation models of HD209458b including passive\ntracers that advect with the 3D flow, including a source/sink on the nightside\nto represent condensation and gravitational settling of haze particles. We show\nthat global advection patterns produce strong vertical mixing that can keep\ncondensable species lofted as long as they are trapped in particles of sizes of\na few microns or less on the night side. We show that vertical mixing results\nnot from small-scale convection but from the large-scale circulation driven by\nthe day-night heating contrast. Although this vertical mixing is not diffusive\nin any rigorous sense, a comparison of our results with idealized diffusion\nmodels allows a rough estimate of the vertical diffusion coefficient.\nKzz=5x10**4/Sqrt(Pbar) m2/s can be used in 1D models of HD 209458b. Moreover,\nour models exhibit strong spatial and temporal variability in the tracer\nconcentration that could result in observable variations during transit or\nsecondary eclipse measurements. Finally, we apply our model to the case of TiO\nin HD209458b and show that the day-night cold trap would deplete TiO if it\ncondenses into particles bigger than a few microns on the planet's night side,\nmaking it unable to create the observed stratosphere of the planet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Jan 2013 23:23:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 Sep 2013 09:06:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

The most attractive scenario for the origin of such a\nlarge scale field is the advection of the field by the gas in the accretion\ndisk from the interstellar medium or a companion star. However, it is realized\nthat outward diffusion of the accreted field is fast compared to the inward\naccretion velocity in a geometrically thin accretion disk if the value of the\nPrandtl number Pm is around unity. In this work, we revisit this problem\nconsidering the angular momentum of the disk is removed predominantly by the\nmagnetically driven outflows. The radial velocity of the disk is significantly\nincreased due to the presence of the outflows. Using a simplified model for the\nvertical disk structure, we find that even moderately weak fields can cause\nsufficient angular momentum loss via a magnetic wind to balance outward\ndiffusion. There are two equilibrium points, one at low field strengths\ncorresponding to a plasma-beta at the midplane of order several hundred, and\none for strong accreted fields, beta~1. We surmise that the first is relevant\nfor the accretion of weak, possibly external, fields through the outer parts of\nthe disk, while the latter one could explain the tendency, observed in full 3D\nnumerical simulations, of strong flux bundles at the centers of disk to stay\nconfined in spite of strong MRI turbulence surrounding them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Jan 2013 08:33:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

Such emission has been seen\npreviously in the compact group HCG 92 (Stephan's Quintet), and was shown to be\nassociated with the dissipation of mechanical energy associated with a\nlarge-scale shock caused when one group member collided, at high velocity, with\ntidal debris in the intragroup medium. Similarly, shock excitation or turbulent\nheating is likely responsible for the enhanced H2 emission in the compact group\ngalaxies, since other sources of heating (UV or X-ray excitation from star\nformation or AGN) are insufficient to account for the observed emission. The\ngroup galaxies fall predominantly in a region of mid-infrared color-color space\nidentified by previous studies as being connected to rapid transformations in\nHCG galaxy evolution. Furthermore, the majority of H2-enhanced galaxies lie in\nthe optical \"green valley\" between the blue cloud and red-sequence, and are\nprimarily early-type disk systems.

The transverse force from\nfree bulk quasiparticles on the vortex, both in the Bose and the Fermi liquid,\noriginates from the Aharonov--Bohm effect. However, in the Fermi liquid one\nshould take into account peculiarities of the Aharonov--Bohm effect for BCS\nquasiparticles described by two-component spinor wave functions. There is no\nconnection between the transverse force (either from free bulk quasiparticles\nor from vortex-core bound quasiparticles) and the spectral flow in the vortex\ncore in superfluid Fermi liquid, in contrast to widely known claims. In fact,\nthere is no steady spectral flow in the core of the moving vortex, and the\nanalogy with the Andreev bound states in the SNS junction, where the spectral\nflow is really possible, is not valid in this respect.\n  The role of the backflow on the vortex mass is clarified.

In order to\ndetermine the extent to which side chain flexibility is involved in ligand\nbinding, a knowledge-based approach was taken. A database composed of examples\nof protein structures in the presence or absence of a given ligand is used to\nanalyze which side chains undergo side chain conformational changes. Such an\nanalysis has determined that up to 40% of binding site do not present side\nchain conformational changes. A total of three residues undergoing side chain\nconformational changes encompass approximately 85% of the binding sites\nstudied. When analyzing the propensities of different amino acids to undergo\nside chain conformational changes we find that there are considerable\ndifferences between different amino acids. A support vector machine learning\napproach was used to create a classifier system utilizing information about the\nsolvent accessible area as well as flexibility scale value of each specific\nside chain to be predicted together with its neighboring side chains. An\naccuracy level of 70% is reached using this approach. The fact that a small\nnumber of residues undergo side chain conformational changes in the majority of\nbinding sites makes it feasible to introduce side chain flexibility in docking\nsimulations. An algorithm has been developed for introducing side chain\nflexibility utilizing a hybrid genetic-algorithm/exhaustive-search procedure\nand a surface complementarity based scoring function. This approach is\nimplemented in the software tool FlexAID. FlexAID utilizes a rotamer library to\ncreate alternative conformations for a list of residues that are exhaustively\nsearched during the docking simulation. The performance of FlexAID in rigid\nlocal as well as global simulations falls in the 70-80% range for both local\nand global simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Jan 2013 14:15:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-22"}
