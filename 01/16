There is, however a scenario\nunder which a detectable signal could have been missed given the search method\nemployed by the analysis, and it would have been found using an alternate\nmethod. The alternate method depends on the hypothesis that two of the neutrino\nmass eigenstates have masses 4.0 eV and 21.4 eV which was inferred from an\nanalysis of the SN 1987A data. Although one might argue that the hypothesis of\nsuch large neutrino masses is remote, there is a way they could be compatible\nwith observed constraints on neutrino masses involving a third tachyonic\n($m^2<0$) eigenstate, plus three sterile neutrinos. Given the importance of a\npositive supernova search result, and the ease of conducting it using existing\nSK data, there would seem to be little reason not to do it.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Jan 2013 16:03:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Feb 2013 13:28:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-13"}

Such statements would be natural candidates for being added as\naxioms, but how can we obtain them? One classical (and well studied) approach\nis to add to some theory T an axiom that claims the consistency of T. In this\npaper we discuss another approach motivated by Chaitin's version of G\u007f\\\"odel's\ntheorem where axioms claiming the randomness (or incompressibility) of some\nstrings are probabilistically added, and show that it is not really useful, in\nthe sense that this does not help us to prove new interesting theorems. This\nresult answers a question recently asked by Lipton. The situation changes if we\ntake into account the size of the proofs: randomly chosen axioms may help\nmaking proofs much shorter, unless NP=PSPACE. We then study the axiomatic power\nof the statements of type \"the Kolmogorov complexity of x exceeds n\" in\ngeneral. They are \\Pi_1 (universally quantified) statements of Peano\narithmetic. We show that by adding all true statements of this type, we obtain\na theory that proves all true \\Pi_1-statements, and also provide a more\ndetailed classification. In particular, to derive all true \\Pi_1-statements it\nis sufficient to add one statement of this type for each n (or even for\ninfinitely many n) if strings are chosen in a special way. On the other hand,\none may add statements of this type for most x of length n (for every n) and\nstill obtain a weak theory. We also study other logical questions related to\n\"random axioms\". Finally, we consider a theory that claims Martin-L\u007f\\\"of\nrandomness of a given infinite binary sequence. This claim can be formalized in\ndifferent ways.

Our photometry\nis supplemented by 2MASS and WISE near-IR and mid-IR magnitudes and then used\nto obtain more accurate effective temperatures and extinctions. For V2253 Oph\nand IT Com, we found their spectral energy distributions consistent with pure\nphotospheric emission. For IS Vir, we detect a marginal mid-IR excess which\nhints towards a dust disk. The orbital and rotational planes of IT Com appear\nto be coplanar, contrary to previous findings in the literature. We apply a\nmultiple frequency analysis technique to determine photometric periods, and\npossibly changes of periods, ranging from days to decades. New rotational\nperiods of 21.55+-0.03d, 65.1+-0.3d, and 23.50+-0.04d were determined for V2253\nOph, IT Com, and IS Vir, respectively.

However at higher temperatures, the EAM\npotential yields a surface melting at $\\simeq 700$ K very low with respect to\nthe experimental bulk melting at $\\simeq 1235$ K while the GP yields a surface\nmelting at $\\simeq 1000$ K closer to the bulk one. In addition, we observe with\nthe EAM potential an anomalous thermal expansion, i. e. the surface contraction\nbecomes a surface dilatation with respect to the bulk, at $\\simeq 900$ K. The\nGupta potential does not show this behavior.We compare our results with\ndifferent experimental and numerical results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Jan 2013 19:42:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

In spite of good performance for datasets of reasonable\nsize, the method proposed in \\cite{Van13} suffers from a serious drawback when\nthe sample size becomes large as it is based on the optimization of a contrast\nfunction whose pointwise computation requires O(n^2) operations.

The intriguing scenario of a star cluster forming\nthrough a single starburst has thereby been challenged. Choosing the case of\nthe R136 cluster of the Large Magellanic Cloud, the most cited one in this\ncontext, we perform direct N-body computations that mimic the early evolution\nof this cluster including the gas-removal phase (on a thermal timescale). Our\ncalculations show that under plausible initial conditions as consistent from\nobservational data, a large fraction (> 60%) of a gas-expelled, expanding\nR136-like cluster is bound to regain dynamical equilibrium by its current age.\nTherefore, the recent measurements of velocity dispersion in the inner regions\nof R136, that indicate that the cluster is in dynamical equilibrium, are\nconsistent with an earlier substantial gas expulsion of R136 followed by a\nrapid re-virialization (in approx. 1 Myr). Additionally, we find that the less\nmassive Galactic NGC 3603 Young Cluster (NYC), with a substantially longer\nre-virialization time, is likely to be found deviated from dynamical\nequilibrium at its present age (approx. 1 Myr). The recently obtained stellar\nproper motions in the central part of the NYC indeed suggest this and are\nconsistent with the computed models. This work significantly extends previous\nmodels of the Orion Nebula Cluster which already demonstrated that the\nre-virialization time of young post-gas-expulsion clusters decreases with\nincreasing pre-expulsion density.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Jan 2013 21:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

A QSL has been predicted to have a host of exotic\nproperties, including fractionalized excitations and long-range quantum\nentanglement. Despite the numerous theoretical studies, experimental\nrealization of a QSL has proved to be challenging due to the lack of candidate\nmaterials. The triangular organic salts EtMe3Sb[Pd(dmit)2]2 and\n{\\kappa}-(BEDT-TTF)2Cu2(CN)3, and kagome ZnCu3(OH)6Cl2 (Herbertsmithite) have\nrecently emerged as promising candidates of exhibiting a QSL state, but the\nnature of their ground states is still elusive. Here we studied a large-area\nhigh-quality single crystal of Herbertsmithite by means of time-domain\nterahertz (THz) spectroscopy. We observed in the low-frequency (0.6-2.2 THz)\noptical conductivity evidence for the nature of the spin system. In particular,\nthe in-plane absorption spectrum exhibits a unique frequency dependence that\ncan be described by a power-law with an exponent of approximately 1.4, in sharp\ncontrast with the {\\omega}^4 dependence expected for an ordered Mott insulator.\nThe absorption is also found to increase as the temperature decreases, a\nbehavior unexpected for conventional insulators. Such features are consistent\nwith recent theory based on the interactions between the charge and spin\ndegrees of freedom in a QSL system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Jan 2013 21:01:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Jan 2013 14:57:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-25"}

These slightly higher quantum states are described by\nelementary excitations and dictate the response of the system under external\nstimuli. The spectrum of these excitations, obtained typically from inelastic\nneutron and x-ray scattering, is the spatial and temporal Fourier transform of\nthe density-density correlation function of the system, which dictates how a\nperturbation propagates in space and time. As frequency-domain measurements do\nnot generally contain phase information, time-domain measurements of these\nfluctuations could yield a more direct method for investigating the excitations\nof solids and their interactions both in equilibrium and far-from equilibrium.\nHere we show that the diffuse scattering of femtosecond x-ray pulses produced\nby a free electron laser (FEL) can directly measure these density-density\ncorrelations due to lattice vibrations in the time domain. We obtain\nspectroscopic information of the lattice excitations with unprecedented\nmomentum- and frequency- resolution, without resolving the energy of the\noutgoing photon. Correlations are created via an acoustic analog of the\ndynamical Casimir effect, where a femtosecond laser pulse slightly quenches the\nphonon frequencies, producing pairs of squeezed phonons at momenta +q and -q.\nThese pairs of phonons manifest as macroscopic, time-dependent coherences in\nthe displacement correlations that are then probed directly by x-ray\nscattering. Since the time-dependent correlations are preferentially created in\nregions of strong electron-phonon coupling, the time-resolved approach is\nnatural as a spectroscopic tool of low energy collective excitations in solids,\nand their microscopic interactions, both in linear response and beyond.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Jan 2013 21:07:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-17"}

A fundamental question is how to efficiently extract genomic\nand epigenomic variants of clinical utility which will provide information for\noptimal wellness and interference strategies. Traditional paradigm for\nidentifying variants of clinical validity is to test association of the\nvariants. However, significantly associated genetic variants may or may not be\nusefulness for diagnosis and prognosis of diseases. Alternative to association\nstudies for finding genetic variants of predictive utility is to systematically\nsearch variants that contain sufficient information for phenotype prediction.\nTo achieve this, we introduce concepts of sufficient dimension reduction and\ncoordinate hypothesis which project the original high dimensional data to very\nlow dimensional space while preserving all information on response phenotypes.\nWe then formulate clinically significant genetic variant discovery problem into\nsparse SDR problem and develop algorithms that can select significant genetic\nvariants from up to or even ten millions of predictors with the aid of dividing\nSDR for whole genome into a number of subSDR problems defined for genomic\nregions. The sparse SDR is in turn formulated as sparse optimal scoring\nproblem, but with penalty which can remove row vectors from the basis matrix.\nTo speed up computation, we develop the modified alternating direction method\nfor multipliers to solve the sparse optimal scoring problem which can easily be\nimplemented in parallel.

Using the\ndensity-matrix renormalization group (DMRG), we obtained the zero temperature\nphase diagram of the model, as well as various correlation functions in each\nphase. Importantly, for a certain range of parameters the model exhibits a\nquasi-long-range spiral (QS) order. To understand the DMRG results, we\nconstruct a mean-field theory based on a Schwinger fermion decomposition of the\nS=1 spins, from which we argue that the QS phase corresponds to a phase in\nproximity to the spin Bose metal state proposed by D.

We use detailed N-body+radiative\ntransfer simulations to follow inhomogeneous reionization of the intergalactic\nmedium (IGM). For the first time we take into account the \"self-regulation\" of\nreionization: star formation in low-mass dwarf galaxies (10^8 M_\\sun \\lesssim M\n\\lesssim 10^9 M_\\sun) or minihalos (10^5 M_\\sun \\lesssim M \\lesssim 10^8\nM_\\sun) is suppressed if these halos form in the regions that were already\nionized or Lyman-Werner dissociated. Some previous work suggested that the\namplitude of the kSZ power spectrum from the EOR can be described by a\ntwo-parameter family: the epoch of half ionization and the duration of\nreionization. However, we argue that this picture applies only to simple forms\nof the reionization history which are roughly symmetric about the\nhalf-ionization epoch. In self-regulated reionization, the universe begins to\nbe ionized early, maintains a low level of ionization for an extended period,\nand then finishes reionization as soon as high-mass atomically-cooling halos\ndominate. While inclusion of self-regulation affects the amplitude of the kSZ\npower spectrum only modestly (\\sim 10 %), it can change the duration of\nreionization by a factor of more than two. We conclude that the simple\ntwo-parameter family does not capture the effect of a physical, yet complex,\nreionization history caused by self-regulation. When added to the\npost-reionization kSZ contribution, our prediction for the total kSZ power\nspectrum is below the current upper bound from the South Pole Telescope.\nTherefore, the current upper bound on the kSZ effect from the EOR is consistent\nwith our understanding of the physics of reionization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Jan 2013 07:29:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

In February 2012,\nSCUBA-2 began a series of unique legacy surveys for the JCMT community. These\nsurveys will take 2.5 years and the results are already providing complementary\ndata to the shorter wavelength, shallower, larger-area surveys from Herschel.\nThe SCUBA-2 surveys will also provide a wealth of information for further study\nwith new facilities such as ALMA, and future telescopes such as CCAT and SPICA.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Jan 2013 10:53:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-09"}

Ignoring the possible effects of growth, which is not expected to be\nsignificant at low redshifts, we present an extended analysis of the BAOs using\nthe sFB formalism by taking into account the role of non-linearities and linear\nredshift distortions in the oscillations observed in the galaxy power spectrum.\nThe sFB power spectrum has both radial and tangential dependence and it has\nbeen shown that in the limit that we approach a deep survey the sFB power\nspectrum is purely radial and collapses to the Cartesian Fourier power\nspectrum. This radialisation of information is shown to hold even in the\npresence of redshift space distortions (RSD) and 1-loop corrections to the\ngalaxy power spectrum albeit with modified tangential and radial dependence.

The sodium photon return varies by a factor of three to four\nover a year, and can change by a factor of two over a night. In addition, the\ncomparison of the photon returns obtained in 2001 with those measured a decade\nlater using GeMS shows a significant difference in laser format efficiencies.\nWe find that the temporal power spectrum of the sodium mean altitude follows a\nlinear trend, in good agreement with the results reported by Pfrommer & Hickson\n(2010).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Jan 2013 13:56:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-17"}

For most stars, gravitational redshifts, convective blueshifts, and\ntransverse stellar motion are the dominant contributors. We provide theoretical\ncorrections for the net velocity shifts due to convection expected for the\nmeasurements from the Gaia Radial Velocity Spectrometer (RVS). We used a set of\nthree-dimensional time-dependent simulations of stellar surface convection\ncomputed with CO5BOLD to calculate spectra of late-type stars in the Gaia RVS\nrange and to infer the net velocity offset that convective motions will induce\nin radial velocities derived by cross-correlation. The net velocity shifts\nderived by cross-correlation depend both on the wavelength range and spectral\nresolution of the observations. Convective shifts for Gaia RVS observations are\nless than 0.1 km/s for late-K-type stars, and they increase with stellar mass,\nreaching about 0.3 km/s or more for early F-type dwarfs. This tendency is the\nresult of an increase with effective temperature in both temperature and\nvelocity fluctuations in the line-forming region. Our simulations also indicate\nthat the net RVS convective shifts can be positive (i.e. redshifts) in some\ncases. Overall, the blueshifts weaken slightly with increasing surface gravity,\nand are enhanced at low metallicity. Gravitational redshifts amount up to 0.7\nkm/s and dominate convective blueshifts for dwarfs, but become much weaker for\ngiants.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Jan 2013 14:41:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

The function of controlled\ncontrolled gate is simply a three-qubit controlled unitary gate and can be\nintuitively explained as follows: the gate will output the states of the two\ncontrol qubit directly, and apply the given one-qubit unitary $u$ on the target\nqubit only if both the states of the control are $\\ket{1}$.

By performing extensive Monte Carlo\ncalculations, we show that the phase transition is characterized by critical\nexponents {\\beta}=0.54(1) and {\\nu} =1.5(1), which differ from the existing\nmean-field-type prediction. We furthermore extend the model by introducing a\ncontrarian type that tries to have neighbors with the opposite opinion, and\nshow that the critical behavior still belongs to the same universality class\nirrespective of such contrarians' fraction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Jan 2013 23:24:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-22"}

However\nthey are consistent with the aether-related Lorentz-Poincare's interpretation\nthat allows absolute simultaneity. We thus strongly challenge the fundamental\nstatus of Lorentz invariance and hence break the basic argument against de\nBroglie-Bohm realistic quantum theory. We argue that both de Broglie-Bohm and\nLorentz-Poincare theories are capable of providing a real synthesis of quantum\nand relativity theories. The synthesis is of such kind that quantum theory\nappears the most fundamental physical theory for which relativity is only a\nlimiting case. In accordance with this hierarchy, quantum theory naturally\nresolves the problem of aether in Lorentz-Poincare's relativity. The aether\ncould be a deeper Bohm-type undivided quantum pre-space, the relevance of which\ndirectly follows from our observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Jan 2013 10:20:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

In this paper we\npropose a novel view of this pipeline based on kernel methods and Nystrom\nsampling. In particular, we focus on the coding of a data point with a local\nrepresentation based on a dictionary with fewer elements than the number of\ndata points, and view it as an approximation to the actual function that would\ncompute pair-wise similarity to all data points (often too many to compute in\npractice), followed by a Nystrom sampling step to select a subset of all data\npoints.\n  Furthermore, since bounds are known on the approximation power of Nystrom\nsampling as a function of how many samples (i.e. dictionary size) we consider,\nwe can derive bounds on the approximation of the exact (but expensive to\ncompute) kernel matrix, and use it as a proxy to predict accuracy as a function\nof the dictionary size, which has been observed to increase but also to\nsaturate as we increase its size.
