One of\nthe main results (Theorem 2) is a normal form theorem in Poisson geometry,\nwhich is the Poisson-geometric version of the Local Reeb Stability (from\nfoliation theory) and of the Slice Theorem (from equivariant geometry). The\nresult generalizes Conn's theorem from fixed points to arbitrary symplectic\nleaves. We present two proofs of this result: a geometric one relying heavily\non the theory of Lie algebroids and Lie groupoids (similar to the new proof of\nConn's theorem by Crainic and Fernandes), and an analytic one using the\nNash-Moser fast convergence method (more in the spirit of Conn's original\nproof). The analytic approach gives much more, we prove a local rigidity result\n(Theorem 4) around compact Poisson submanifolds, which is the first of this\nkind in Poisson geometry. Theorem 4 has a surprising application to the study\nof smooth deformation of Poisson structures: in Theorem 5 we compute the\nPoisson-moduli space around the Lie-Poisson sphere (i.e. the invariant unit\nsphere inside the linear Poisson manifold corresponding to a compact semisimple\nLie algebra). This is the first such computation of a Poisson moduli space in\ndimension greater or equal to 3 around a degenerate (i.e. non-symplectic)\nPoisson structure. Other results presented in the thesis are: a new proof to\nthe existence of symplectic realizations (Theorem 0), a normal form theorem for\nsymplectic foliations (Theorem 1), a formal normal form/rigidity result around\nPoisson submanifolds (Theorem 3), and a general construction of tame homotopy\noperators for Lie algebroid cohomology (the Tame Vanishing Lemma). We also\nrevisit Conn's theorem and a theorem of Hamilton on rigidity of foliations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Jan 2013 16:17:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Jan 2013 03:40:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-24"}

Our initial setup consists of a Keplerian disk attached to\na non-rotating star. In a previous work, we found that in hydrodynamical\nsimulations, sound waves excited by shear in the BL were able to efficiently\ntransport angular momentum and drive mass accretion onto the star. Here we\nconfirm that in MHD simulations, waves serve as an efficient means of angular\nmomentum transport in the vicinity of the BL, despite the magnetorotational\ninstability (MRI) operating in the disk. In particular, the angular momentum\ncurrent due to waves is at times larger than the angular momentum current due\nto MRI. Our results suggest that angular momentum transport in the BL and its\nvicinity is a global phenomenon occurring through dissipation of waves and\nshocks. This point of view is quite different from the standard picture of\ntransport by a local anomalous turbulent viscosity. In addition to angular\nmomentum transport, we also study magnetic field amplification within the BL.\nWe find that the field is indeed amplified in the BL, but only by a factor of a\nfew and remains subthermal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Jan 2013 16:55:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

Our\nsimulations reveal that while a water molecule forms, on average, two strong\ndonor and two strong acceptor bonds, there is a significant asymmetry in the\nenergy of these contacts. We demonstrate that this asymmetry is a result of\nsmall instantaneous distortions of hydrogen bonds, which appear as fluctuations\non a timescale of hundreds of femtoseconds around the average symmetric\nstructure.

Ambiguous volatility implies market incompleteness that rules out\nperfect hedging. Consequently, hedging arguments determine prices only up to\nintervals.

This work improves upon the original discriminatory channel estimation\n(DCE) scheme proposed by Chang et al where multiple stages of feedback and\nretraining were used. While most studies on physical layer secrecy are under\nthe information-theoretic framework and focus directly on the data transmission\nphase, studies on DCE focus on the training phase and aim to provide a\npractical signal processing technique to discriminate between the channel\nestimation performances at LR and UR. A key feature of DCE designs is the\ninsertion of artificial noise (AN) in the training signal to degrade the\nchannel estimation performance at UR. To do so, AN must be placed in a\ncarefully chosen subspace based on the transmitter's knowledge of LR's channel\nin order to minimize its effect on LR. In this paper, we adopt the idea of\ntwo-way training that allows both the transmitter and LR to send training\nsignals to facilitate channel estimation at both ends. Both reciprocal and\nnon-reciprocal channels are considered and a two-way DCE scheme is proposed for\neach scenario. {For mathematical tractability, we assume that all terminals\nemploy the linear minimum mean square error criterion for channel estimation.\nBased on the mean square error (MSE) of the channel estimates at all\nterminals,} we formulate and solve an optimization problem where the optimal\npower allocation between the training signal and AN is found by minimizing the\nMSE of LR's channel estimate subject to a constraint on the MSE achievable at\nUR.

As part of\nthe \"Water In Star-forming regions with Herschel\" (WISH) key program, water and\nother important molecules, such as CO and OH, have been observed in 51 embedded\nyoung stellar objects (YSOs). The studied sample covers a range of luminosities\nfrom <1 to >10^5 L_sol. Aims; We analyse the CO line emission towards a large\nsample of protostars in terms of both line intensities and profiles. Methods;\nHerschel-HIFI spectra of the 12CO 10-9, 13CO 10-9 and C18O 5-4, 9-8 and 10-9\nlines are analysed for a sample of 51 YSOs. In addition, JCMT spectra of 12CO\n3-2 and C18O 3-2 extend this analysis to cooler gas components. Results; All\nobserved CO and isotopologue spectra show a strong linear correlation between\nthe logarithms of the line and bolometric luminosities across six orders of\nmagnitude on both axes. This suggests that the high-J CO lines primarily trace\nthe amount of dense gas associated with YSOs. This relation can be extended to\nlarger (extragalactic) scales. The majority of the detected 12CO line profiles\ncan be decomposed into a broad and a narrow Gaussian component, while the C18O\nspectra are mainly fitted with a single Gaussian. A broadening of the line\nprofile is also observed from pre-stellar cores to embedded protostars, which\nis due mostly to non-thermal motions (turbulence/infall). The widths of the\nbroad 12CO 3-2 and 10-9 velocity components correlate with those of the narrow\nC18O 9-8 profiles, suggesting that the entrained outflowing gas and envelope\nmotions are related independent of the mass of the protostar. These results\nindicate that physical processes in protostellar envelopes have similar\ncharacteristics across the studied luminosity range.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Jan 2013 14:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

In this\ncomputational model we give several new results that improve over the previous\nstate-of-the-art. Our main result is a novel conditional gradient algorithm for\nsmooth and strongly convex optimization over polyhedral sets that performs only\na single linear optimization step over the domain on each iteration and enjoys\na linear convergence rate. This gives an exponential improvement in convergence\nrate over previous results.\n  Based on this new conditional gradient algorithm we give the first algorithms\nfor online convex optimization over polyhedral sets that perform only a single\nlinear optimization step over the domain while having optimal regret\nguarantees, answering an open question of Kalai and Vempala, and Hazan and\nKale. Our online algorithms also imply conditional gradient algorithms for\nnon-smooth and stochastic convex optimization with the same convergence rates\nas projected (sub)gradient methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Jan 2013 15:54:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Jan 2013 22:32:09 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 8 Feb 2013 17:06:16 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 19 Mar 2013 20:49:45 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sun, 15 Sep 2013 10:50:33 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Fri, 14 Aug 2015 18:02:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-17"}

A specific form of the potential and\nappropriate values of the parameters allow to obtain early tachyonic dark\nmatter with $\\omega_{T} \\approx 0$ in recent Universe as well. On the other\nhand, related to the structure of the field equations describing the dynamics\nof the background we assumed the form of non-gravitational interaction to be\ngiven in advance. A sing changeable interaction between dark energy and dark\nmatter is also included due to a huge interest towards it in recent literature.\nPossible future finite time singularities for cansidered models have been\ndetermined to finalize the paper. The study shows that in case of\nnon-interacting model, the fate of the Universe will be either Type II~(The\nSudden Singularity), or Type IV~(Generalized Sudden Singularity) singularity.\nOn the other hand, the consideration of $Q=3 b H \\rho_{de}$ non-gravitational\ninteraction in addition to Type II and Type IV singularities will induce also\nType V~($\\omega$-singularity) singularity. Whilst in the model with $Q=3 b q H\n\\rho_{de}$ non-gravitational interaction only Type IV singularity will be\nobserved. Moreover, $2$ forms of the scale factor has been considered\nseparately allowing analytically obtain the behavior of the cosmological\nparameters without specifying an explicit form of the potential for tachyonic\nmatter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Jan 2013 12:51:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Aug 2017 09:54:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-16"}
