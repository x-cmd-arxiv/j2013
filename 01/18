This model relies on a non-stationary gaussian process that\nexhibits aging behavior. It turns out that its properties, over any finite time\ninterval, are very close to continuous cascade models. These latter models are\nindeed well known to reproduce faithfully the main stylized facts of financial\ntime series. However, it involve a large scale parameter (the so-called\n\"integral scale\" where the cascade is initiated) that is hard to interpret in\nfinance. Moreover the empirical value of the integral scale is in general\ndeeply correlated to the overall length of the sample. This feature is\nprecisely predicted by our model that turns out, as illustrated on various\nexamples from daily stock index data, to quantitatively reproduce the empirical\nobservations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Jan 2013 17:17:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

Specifically, the\ndistribution of contracted and stretched bond lengths due to the presence of\ndefects, and hopping energies for low-energy electrons, i.e. the 2pz electrons,\nshow two different patterns for the two types of defects.

The light curve variability time scale is an\ninteresting parameter which most models attribute to a physical origin e.g.,\ncentral engine activity, clumpy circumburst medium, or relativistic turbulence.\nWe develop a statistical method to estimate the GRB minimum variability time\nscale (MVT) for long and short GRBs detected by GBM. We find that the MVT of\nshort bursts is distinctly shorter than that for long GRBs supprting the\npossibility of a more compact central engine of the former. We find that MVT\nestimated by this method is consistent with the shortest rise time of the\nfitted pulses. Hence we use the fitted pulse rise times to study the evolution\nof burst variability time scale. Variability time is in turn related to the\nminimum bulk Lorentz factor. Using this we relate the GRB spectral evolution to\nthe evolution of the variability time scale. %Gamma-ray burst (GRB) light\ncurves are believed to result from internal shocks reflecting the activities of\nthe GRB central engine. %Hence their temporal deconvolution studies can\npotentially lead to the understanding of the evolution of the minimum\nvariability %time scales which in turn is related to the minimum bulk Lorentz\nfactor.

Most of the\nMAC protocols proposed in the literature employ Common Control Channel (CCC) to\nmanage the resources among Cognitive Radio (CR) users. Control channel\nsaturation in case of large number of CR users is one of the main drawbacks of\nthe CCC based MAC protocols. In contrast with CCC based MAC protocols, DSAT-MAC\nprotocol is based on the TDMA mechanism, without using any CCC for control\ninformation exchange. The channels are divided into time slots and CR users\nsend their control or data packets over their designated slot. The protocol\nensures that no slot is left vacant.

The protocol includes the provision for Quality of Service, where\nreal-time and safety critical data is transmitted with highest priority and\nleast delay. The protocol also ensures a fair sharing of available spectrum\namong the CR users, with the mechanism to regulate the transmission of\nmalicious nodes.

More precisely, we address the\nproblem of computing p-values for single regression coefficients.\n  On one hand, we develop a general upper bound on the minimax power of tests\nwith a given significance level. On the other, we prove that this upper bound\nis (nearly) achievable through a practical procedure in the case of random\ndesign matrices with independent entries. Our approach is based on a debiasing\nof the Lasso estimator. The analysis builds on a rigorous characterization of\nthe asymptotic distribution of the Lasso estimator and its debiased version.\nOur result holds for optimal sample size, i.e., when $n$ is at least on the\norder of $s_0 \\log(p/s_0)$.\n  We generalize our approach to random design matrices with i.i.d. Gaussian\nrows $x_i\\sim N(0,\\Sigma)$. In this case we prove that a similar distributional\ncharacterization (termed `standard distributional limit') holds for $n$ much\nlarger than $s_0(\\log p)^2$.\n  Finally, we show that for optimal sample size, $n$ being at least of order\n$s_0 \\log(p/s_0)$, the standard distributional limit for general Gaussian\ndesigns can be derived from the replica heuristics in statistical physics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Jan 2013 21:16:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 24 May 2013 07:02:40 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 4 Feb 2014 04:05:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-05"}

An 89 MeV $^{21}$Na radioactive ion beam\nwas produced at the CNS Radioactive Ion Beam Separator and bombarded an 8.8\nmg/cm$^2$ thick polyethylene target.

Initial measurements using\nback-gated field-effect transistor (FET) structures on SiO2 yielded mobility of\n1-50 cm^2/Vs for few-layer MoS2[1, 2]. Initial measurements using back-gated\nfield-effect transistor (FET) structures on SiO2 yielded mobility of 1-50\ncm^2/Vs for few-layer MoS2[1, 2]. However, greatly increased mobility - as high\nas 900 cm^2/Vs - was recently reported for monolayer MoS2 by Radisavljevic, et\nal.[Ref. 3; see also Refs. 4-6], and for multilayer MoS2 by others[7, 8], in\ndevices covered by a high-kappa dielectric layer and a metal top gate. Similar\nincreases were reported for electrolyte top-gated MoS2[9]. A puzzling common\naspect of these reports is that the double-gated devices consistently show much\nhigher mobility when measured using the weakly-coupled back gate (typically 300\nnm of SiO2) than using the strongly-coupled top gate. While this difference\nmight be attributed to a different quality of the top and bottom surfaces, the\nlarge discrepancy motivates close examination of the measurement techniques to\nrule out spurious effects. Notably, it has been shown that the mobility may be\ngreatly overestimated in this geometry[10, 11].

Instead of\nusing Euclidean distances \"d\" as in Szekely et al, we use \"similarity\", which\ncan be defined as \"exp(-d/s)\", where the scaling parameter s>0 controls how\nrapidly the similarity falls off with distance. Scale parameters are chosen by\nmaximizing the similarity correlation. The motivation for using \"similarity\"\noriginates in spectral clustering theory (see e.g. Ng et al 2001, Advances in\nNeural Information Processing Systems 14: 849-856). We show that a particular\nform of similarity correlation is asymptotically equivalent to distance\ncorrelation for large values of the scale parameter. Furthermore, we extend\nsimilarity correlation to coherence between complex valued vectors, including\nits partitioning into real and imaginary contributions. Several toy examples\nare used for comparing distance and similarity correlations. For instance,\npoints on a noiseless straight line give distance and similarity correlation\nvalues equal to 1; but points on a noiseless circle produces near zero distance\ncorrelation (dCorr=0.02) while the similarity correlation is distinctly non\nzero (sCorr=0.36).

Many complex diseases such as type 1 and 2\ndiabetes, autism, bipolar disorder, allergies, Alzheimer disease, and some\ncancers show significantly higher concordance in monozygotic (MZ) twins than in\ndizygotic twins (DZ) or parent-child pairs, suggesting their etiology is\nstrongly influenced by genetics. Preventing these diseases based on genetic\ndata alone is frequently impossible. We hypothesize that the incidence of\ncomplex diseases could be significantly reduced in the future through a\nstrategy based on time-separated twinning. This strategy involves the\ncollection and fertilization of human oocytes followed by several rounds of\nartificial twinning. If preimplantation genetic screening (PGS) reports no\naneuploidy or known Mendelian disorders, one of the MZ siblings would be\nimplanted and the remaining embryos cryoconserved. Once the health of the adult\nMZ sibling(s) is established, subsequent parenthood with the cryoconserved\ntwins could substantially lower the incidence of hereditary disorders with\nMendelian or complex etiology. The proposed method of artificial twinning has\nthe potential to alleviate suffering and reduce the negative social impact\ninduced by dysgenic effects associated with known and unknown genetic factors.\nTime-separated twinning has the capacity to prevent further accumulation of the\ngenetic load and to provide source of isogenic embryonic stem cells for future\nregenerative therapies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Jan 2013 05:25:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-21"}

Low Mach numbers may in particular lead to the\nwell-known, incompressible Kolmogorov turbulence, while for high Mach numbers,\nwe are in the highly compressible regime, thus close to Burgers turbulence. In\nthis study, we explore whether in this large range of conditions, a universal\nbehavior can be expected. Our starting point are previous investigations in the\nkinematic regime. Here, analytic studies based on the Kazantsev model have\nshown that the behavior of the dynamo depends significantly on Pm and the type\nof turbulence, and numerical simulations indicate a strong dependence of the\ngrowth rate on the Mach number of the flow. Once the magnetic field saturates\non the current amplification scale, backreactions occur and the growth is\nshifted to the next-larger scale. We employ a Fokker-Planck model to calculate\nthe magnetic field amplification during the non-linear regime, and find a\nresulting power-law growth that depends on the type of turbulence invoked. For\nKolmogorov turbulence, we confirm previous results suggesting a linear growth\nof magnetic energy. For more general turbulent spectra, where the turbulent\nvelocity v_t scales with the characteristic length scale as u_\\ell\\propto\n\\ell^{\\vartheta}, we find that the magnetic energy grows as\n(t/T_{ed})^{2\\vartheta/(1-\\vartheta)}, with t the time-coordinate and T_{ed}\nthe eddy-turnover time on the forcing scale of turbulence. For Burgers\nturbulence, \\vartheta=1/2, a quadratic rather than linear growth may thus be\nexpected, and a larger timescale until saturation is reached.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Jan 2013 13:02:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

Skiplists are widely used in practice\nbecause they offer a performance comparable to balanced binary trees, and can\nbe implemented more efficiently. To achieve this performance, most\nimplementations dynamically increment the height (the number of levels).\nSkiplists are difficult to reason about because of the dynamic size (number of\nnodes) and the sharing between the different layers. Furthermore, reasoning\nabout dynamic height adds the challenge of dealing with arbitrary many levels.\n  The first contribution of this paper is the theory TSL that allows to express\nthe heap memory layout of a skiplist of arbitrary height.

This is the fact that the concrete implementation of the\nrestrictions on paths over an interval of time corresponds, in an operator\nlanguage, to sharp monitoring at every moment of time in the given time\ninterval. Such processes suffer from the quantum Zeno effect -- the continual\nmonitoring of a quantum system in a Hilbert subspace prevents its state from\nleaving that subspace. As a consequence, path integral amplitudes defined in\nthis seemingly obvious way have physically and intuitively unreasonable\nproperties and in particular, no sensible classical limit. In this paper we\ndescribe this frequently-occurring but little-appreciated phenomenon in some\ndetail, showing clearly the connection with the quantum Zeno effect. We then\nshow that it may be avoided by implementing the restriction on paths in the\npath integral in a \"softer\" way. The resulting amplitudes then involve a new\ncoarse graining parameter, which may be taken to be a timescale $\\eps$,\ndescribing the softening of the restrictions on the paths. We argue that the\ncomplications arising from the Zeno effect are then negligible as long as $\\eps\n>> 1/ E$, where $E$ is the energy scale of the incoming state. Our criticisms\nof path integral constructions largely apply to approaches to quantum theory\nsuch as the decoherent histories approach or quantum measure theory, which do\nnot specifically involve measurements.

We\nstudy a certain class of idempotent elements E in the multiplier algebra of the\ntensor product of B with C, called separability idempotents. The conditions\ninclude the existence of non-degenerate anti-homomorphisms from B to M(C) and\nfrom C to M(B), the multiplier algebras of C and B respectively. They are\ncalled the antipodal maps. There also exist what we call distinguished linear\nfunctionals. They are unique and faithful in the regular case. The notion is\nmore restrictive than what is generally considered in the case of\n(finite-dimensional) algebras with identity. The separability idempotents we\nconsider in this paper are of a Frobenius type. It seems to be quite natural to\nconsider this type of separability idempotents in the case of non-degenerate\nalgebras possibly without an identity. One example is coming from a discrete\nquantum group A. Here we take B=C=A and E is the image under the coproduct of\nh, where h is the normalized cointegral. The antipodal maps coincide with the\noriginal antipode and the distinguished linear functionals are the integrals.\nAnother example is obtained from a weak multiplier Hopf algebra A. Now B and C\nare the images of the source and target maps. For E we take the canonical\nidempotent. Again the antipodal maps come from the antipode of the weak\nmultiplier Hopf algebra.
