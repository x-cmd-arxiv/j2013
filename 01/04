A second,\ndeterministic model transfers information directly from a first atom onto a\ncavity photon, which carries it over an optical channel to a second atom; a\nprototype with neutral atoms has recently been demonstrated. In both cases, the\ncentral challenge is to find an efficient transfer process that preserves the\ncoherence of the quantum state. Here, following the second scheme, we map the\nquantum state of a single ion onto a single photon within an optical cavity.\nUsing an ion allows us to prepare the initial quantum state in a deterministic\nway, while the cavity enables high-efficiency photon generation. The mapping\nprocess is time-independent, allowing us to characterize the interplay between\nefficiency and fidelity.

Establishing the multiplicity of O-type stars is the first step\ntowards accurately determining their stellar parameters. Moreover, the\ndistribution of the orbital parameters provides observational clues to the way\nthat O-type stars form and to the interactions during their evolution. Aims.\nOur objective is to constrain the multiplicity of a sample of O-type stars\nbelonging to poorly investigated OB associations in the Cygnus complex and for\nthe first time to provide orbital parameters for binaries identified in our\nsample. Such information is relevant to addressing the issue of the binarity in\nthe context of O-type star formation scenarios. Methods. We performed a\nlong-term spectroscopic survey of nineteen O-type stars. We searched for radial\nvelocity variations to unveil binaries on timescales from a few days up to a\nfew years, on the basis of a large set of optical spectra. Results. We confirm\nthe binarity for four objects: HD193443, HD228989, HD229234 and HD194649. We\nderive for the first time the orbital solutions of three systems, and we\nconfirm the values of the fourth, showing that these four systems all have\norbital periods shorter than 10 days. Besides these results, we also detect\nseveral objects that show non-periodic line profile variations in some of their\nspectral lines. These variations mainly occur in the spectral lines, that are\ngenerally affected by the stellar wind and are not likely to be related to\nbinarity. Conclusions. The minimal binary fraction in our sample is estimated\nto be 21%, but it varies from one OB association to the next. Indeed, 33% of O\nstars belonging to CygOB1 are binary systems, 0% in CygOB3, 0% in CygOB8, and\n33% in CygOB9. Our spectroscopic investigation also stresses the absence of\nlong-period systems among the stars in our sample...\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Jan 2013 16:45:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

Finally, by the\nextension of the time reparametrization symmetry to all of the temporal hidden\nvariables, we treat the issue of time reversal symmetry breaking as the\nspontaneous breaking of this extended time reparametrization symmetry. The\nclassification of unitary time-dependent processes and the geometrizations of\nunitary and non-unitary time evolutions using the language of the derived\ncategory are also investigated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Jan 2013 17:08:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 25 Feb 2013 14:54:05 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 31 Mar 2013 14:53:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

The balance of supply and demand of electric energy is one of the\nmost important requirements of MG management. In this paper, we present a novel\nframework for smart energy management based on the concept of\nquality-of-service in electricity (QoSE). Specifically, the resident\nelectricity demand is classified into basic usage and quality usage. The basic\nusage is always guaranteed by the MG, while the quality usage is controlled\nbased on the MG state. The microgrid control center (MGCC) aims to minimize the\nMG operation cost and maintain the outage probability of quality usage, i.e.,\nQoSE, below a target value, by scheduling electricity among renewable energy\nresources, energy storage systems, and macrogrid. The problem is formulated as\na constrained stochastic programming problem. The Lyapunov optimization\ntechnique is then applied to derive an adaptive electricity scheduling\nalgorithm by introducing the QoSE virtual queues and energy storage virtual\nqueues. The proposed algorithm is an online algorithm since it does not require\nany statistics and future knowledge of the electricity supply, demand and price\nprocesses. We derive several \"hard\" performance bounds for the proposed\nalgorithm, and evaluate its performance with trace-driven simulations. The\nsimulation results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed electricity\nscheduling algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Jan 2013 18:30:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-04"}

Using generalised geometry, we find that timelike U-dualities, despite\nprevious conjectures, do not change the signature of the spacetime.\nFurthermore, we prove that the spacetime signature must be $(-,+,...,+)$ when\nthe U-duality modular group is either $\\frac{SL(2)\\times SL(3)}{SO(1,1)\\times\nSO(2,1)}$ or $\\frac{SL(5)}{SO(3,2)}$. We find that for some dual solutions it\nis necessary to include a trivector field which is related to the existence of\nnon-geometric fluxes in lower dimensions. In the second part of the paper, we\nexplicitly study the action of the dualities on supergravity solutions\ncorresponding to M2-branes. For a finite range of the transformation, the\naction of $SL(2)\\otimes SL(3)$ on the worldvolume of uncharged M2-branes\ncharges them while it changes the charge of extreme M2-branes. It thus acts as\na Harrison transformation. At the limits of the range, we obtain the\n\"subtracted geometries\" which correspond to an infinite Harrison boost. Outside\nthis range the trivector field becomes non-zero and we obtain a dual solution\nthat cannot be uniquely written in terms of a metric, 3-form and trivector.\nInstead it corresponds to a family of solutions linked by a local SO(1,1)\nrotation. The SL(5) duality is used to act on a smeared extreme M2-brane giving\na brane-like solution carrying momentum in the transverse direction that the\nbrane was delocalised along.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Jan 2013 20:33:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 11 Aug 2013 13:36:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 27 Nov 2013 14:17:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-28"}

This method, however, relies on the assumption\nthat the baryon fraction in clusters agrees with the cosmic value\nOmega_b/Omega_m, and does not differ from one system to another. We test this\nhypothesis by measuring the gas mass fraction over the entire cluster volume in\na sample of local clusters. Combining the SZ thermal pressure from Planck and\nthe X-ray gas density from ROSAT, we measured for the first time the average\ngas fraction (fgas) out to the virial radius and beyond in a large sample of\nclusters. We also obtained azimuthally-averaged measurements of the gas\nfraction for 18 individual systems, which we used to compute the scatter of\nfgas around the mean value at different radii and its dependence on the\ncluster's temperature. The gas mass fraction increases with radius and reaches\nthe cosmic baryon fraction close to R200. At R200, we measure\nfgas,200=0.176+/-0.009. We find significant differences between the baryon\nfraction of relaxed, cool-core (CC) systems and unrelaxed, non-cool core (NCC)\nclusters in the outer regions. In average, the gas fraction in NCC clusters\nslightly exceeds the cosmic baryon fraction, while in CC systems the gas\nfraction converges to the expected value when accounting for the stellar\ncontent, without any evidence for variations from one system to another. We\nfind that fgas estimates in NCC systems slightly disagree with the cosmic value\napproaching R200. This result could be explained either by a violation of the\nassumption of hydrostatic equilibrium or by an inhomogeneous distribution of\nthe gas mass. Conversely, cool-core clusters are found to provide reliable\nconstraints on fgas at overdensities >200, which makes them suitable for\ncosmological studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Jan 2013 21:00:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Oct 2015 08:43:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-08"}

This allows accurate forward modeling\nof the effects of data reduction on simulated disk images, and thus direct\ncomparison with the imaged disk. The resulting best-fit values and well-fitting\nintervals for the model parameters are a surface brightness power-law slope of\nS_out = -3.2 [-3.6,-2.9], an inclination of i = 84{\\deg} [81{\\deg},86{\\deg}], a\nhigh Henyey-Greenstein forward-scattering parameter of g = 0.45 [0.35, 0.60],\nand a non-significant disk-star offset of u = 3.0 [-1.5, 7.5] AU = 24 [-13, 61]\nmas along the line of nodes.

After a perigalactic pass, a cluster re-captures previously unbound\nstars, and the tidal shock at perigalacticon has the effect of energizing inner\nregion stars to larger orbits. Therefore, instead of the limiting radius being\nimposed at perigalacticon, it more nearly traces the instantaneous tidal radius\nof the cluster at any point in the orbit.

The rotational transitions of the carbon\nmonoxide (CO) molecule provide an excellent probe of the gas excitation\nconditions in these galaxies. In this paper we present the results from the gas\nexcitation sample of the Evolution of molecular Gas in Normal Galaxies (EGNoG)\nsurvey at the Combined Array for Research in Millimeter-wave Astronomy (CARMA).\nThis subset of the full EGNoG sample consists of four galaxies at z~0.3 with\nstar formation rates of 40-65 M_Sun yr^-1 and stellar masses of ~2x10^11 M_Sun.\nUsing the 3 mm and 1 mm bands at CARMA, we observe both the CO(1-0) and CO(3-2)\ntransitions in these four galaxies in order to probe the excitation of the\nmolecular gas. We report robust detections of both lines in three galaxies (and\nan upper limit on the fourth), with an average line ratio, r_31 = L'_CO(3-2) /\nL'_CO(1-0), of 0.46 \\pm 0.07 (with systematic errors \\lesssim 40%), which\nimplies sub-thermal excitation of the CO(3-2) line. We conclude that the\nexcitation of the gas in these massive, highly star-forming galaxies is\nconsistent with normal star-forming galaxies such as local spirals, not\nstarbursting systems like local ultra-luminous infrared galaxies. Since the\nEGNoG gas excitation sample galaxies are selected from the main sequence of\nstar-forming galaxies, we suggest that this result is applicable to studies of\nmain sequence galaxies at intermediate and high redshifts, supporting the\nassumptions made in studies that find molecular gas fractions in star forming\ngalaxies at z~1-2 to be an order of magnitude larger than what is observed\nlocally.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Jan 2013 21:02:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

This evolution has led to the development of\nadvanced calibration techniques that ensure the delivery of accurate results at\nthe lowest possible computational cost. However, the performance of such\ncalibration techniques is still limited by the compact, bright sources in the\nsky, used as calibrators. It is important to have a bright enough source that\nis well distinguished from the background noise level in order to achieve\nsatisfactory results in calibration. We present \"clustered calibration\" as a\nmodification to traditional radio interferometric calibration, in order to\naccommodate faint sources that are almost below the background noise level into\nthe calibration process. The main idea is to employ the information of the\nbright sources' measured signals as an aid to calibrate fainter sources that\nare nearby the bright sources. In the case where we do not have bright enough\nsources, a source cluster could act as a bright source that can be\ndistinguished from background noise. We construct a number of source clusters\nassuming that the signals of the sources belonging to a single cluster are\ncorrupted by almost the same errors, and each cluster is calibrated as a single\nsource, using the combined coherencies of its sources simultaneously. This\nupgrades the power of an individual faint source by the effective power of its\ncluster. We give performance analysis of clustered calibration to show the\nsuperiority of this approach compared to the traditional unclustered\ncalibration.

One\ntype of variability is possibly connected with the accretion of matter through\nthe Rayleigh-Taylor instability that occurs at the interface between an\naccretion disc and a stellar magnetosphere. In this regime, matter accretes in\nseveral temporarily formed accretion streams or `tongues' which appear in\nrandom locations, and produce stochastic photometric and line variability. We\nuse the results of global three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations of\nmatter flows in both stable and unstable accretion regimes to calculate\ntime-dependent hydrogen line profiles and study their variability behaviours.\nIn the stable regime, some hydrogen lines (e.g. H-beta, H-gamma, H-delta,\nPa-beta and Br-gamma) show a redshifted absorption component only during a\nfraction of a stellar rotation period, and its occurrence is periodic. However,\nin the unstable regime, the redshifted absorption component is present rather\npersistently during a whole stellar rotation cycle, and its strength varies\nnon-periodically. In the stable regime, an ordered accretion funnel stream\npasses across the line of sight to an observer only once per stellar rotation\nperiod while in the unstable regime, several accreting streams/tongues, which\nare formed randomly, pass across the line of sight to an observer. The latter\nresults in the quasi-stationarity appearance of the redshifted absorption\ndespite the strongly unstable nature of the accretion. In the unstable regime,\nmultiple hot spots form on the surface of the star, producing the stochastic\nlight curve with several peaks per rotation period. This study suggests a CTTS\nthat exhibits a stochastic light curve and a stochastic line variability, with\na rather persistent redshifted absorption component, may be accreting in the\nunstable accretion regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Jan 2013 22:18:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 25 Feb 2013 17:08:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

We find that if ~30% of the strong MgII systems\ntowards QSOs are missing from the observed samples, then GRBs and QSOs would\nhave comparable numbers of absorbers per unit redshift.

These highly prompt SEPs are believed to be\naccelerated directly by the flare, rather than by the CME shock, although the\nprecise mechanism by which the particles are accelerated remains controversial.\nWhatever their origin, within the magnetic geometry of the standard\neruptive-flare model, the accelerated particles should remain trapped in the\nclosed magnetic fields of the coronal flare loops and the ejected flux rope. In\nthis case the particles would reach the Earth only after a delay of many hours\nto a few days, when the bulk ejecta arrive at Earth. We propose that the\nexternal magnetic reconnection intrinsic to the breakout model for CME\ninitiation can naturally account for the prompt escape of flare-accelerated\nenergetic particles onto open interplanetary magnetic flux tubes. We present\ndetailed 2.5D MHD simulations of a breakout CME/flare event with a background\nisothermal solar wind. Our calculations demonstrate that if the event occurs\nsufficiently near a coronal-hole boundary, interchange reconnection between\nopen and closed field can occur, which allows particles from deep inside the\nejected flux rope to access solar wind field lines soon after eruption.

This possibility gives rise to the probability of a bouncing\nuniverse. As will be shown in the article that a simple Lee-Wick radiation is\nnot enough to produce a bounce. There can be two possibilities which can\nproduce a bounce in the Lee-Wick radiation phase. One requires a cold dark\nmatter candidate to trigger the bounce and the other possibility requires the\nbouncing temperature to be fine tuned such as all the Lee-Wick partners of the\nstandard fields are not thermalized at the bounce temperature.

After extending a well-known bar framework and stress\ncondition to strict jamming, we prove that a packing with period Lambda is\nconsistently strictly jammed if and only if it is strictly jammed with respect\nto Lambda and consistently periodically jammed. We next extend a result about\nrigid unit mode spectra in crystallography to characterize periodic jamming on\nsublattices.

Sixteen optical fibres\ncollect light from a 5.0 arcsecond^2 area of sky and reformat it into the\nequivalent of a 0.6 arcsecond wide slit, delivering a spectral resolution of R\n= 70000 and up to twice as much flux as the standard 1 arcsecond slit of the\nCoud\\'e train. CYCLOPS2 also adds support for simultaneous ThAr wavelength\ncalibration via a dedicated fibre. CYCLOPS2 consists of three main components,\nthe fore-optics unit, fibre bundle and slit unit. The fore optics unit\nincorporates magnification optics and a lenslet array and is designed to mount\nto the CURE Cassegrain instrument interface, which provides acquisition,\nguiding and calibration facilities. The fibre bundle transports the light from\nthe Cassegrain focus to the UCLES spectrograph at Coud\\'e and also includes a\nfibre mode scrambler.

By filtering out the\nairglow emission lines at high resolution before the light enters the\nspectrograph this technique prevents scattering from the emission lines into\ninterline regions, thereby reducing the background at all wavelengths. In order\nto take full advantage of this sky background reduction the spectrograph must\nhave very low instrumental backgrounds so that it remains sky noise limited.\nBoth simulations and real world experience with the prototype GNOSIS system\nshow that existing spectrographs, designed for higher sky background levels,\nwill be unable to fully exploit the sky background reduction. We therefore\npropose PRAXIS, a spectrograph optimised specifically for this purpose. The\nPRAXIS concept is a fibre fed, fully cryogenic, fixed format spectrograph for\nthe J and H-bands. Dark current will be minimised by using the best of the\nlatest generation of NIR detectors while thermal backgrounds will be reduced by\nthe use of a cryogenic fibre slit. Optimised spectral formats and the use of\nhigh throughput volume phase holographic gratings will further enhance\nsensitivity. Our proposal is for a modular system, incorporating exchangeable\nfore-optics units, integral field units and OH suppression units, to allow\nPRAXIS to operate as a visitor instrument on any large telescope and enable new\ndevelopments in FBG OH suppression to be incorporated as they become available.\nAs a high performance fibre fed spectrograph PRAXIS could also serve as a\ntestbed for other astrophotonic technologies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Jan 2013 06:59:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Jan 2013 04:40:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-08"}

When analyzing such\ndata, parametric models are often too inflexible while non-parametric\nprocedures tend to be non-robust because of insufficient data on these high\ndimensional spaces. When dealing with these types of data, it is often the case\nthat most of the variability tends to lie along a few directions, or more\ngenerally along a much smaller dimensional subspace of the feature space. Hence\na class of regression models is proposed that flexibly learn about this\nsubspace while simultaneously performing dimension reduction in classification.\nThis methodology, allows the cell probabilities to vary non-parametrically\nbased on a few coordinates expressed as linear combinations of the predictors.\nAlso, as opposed to many black-box methods for dimensionality reduction, the\nproposed model is appealing in having clearly interpretable and identifiable\nparameters which provide insight into which predictors are important in\ndetermining accurate classification boundaries. Gibbs sampling methods are\ndeveloped for posterior computations. The estimated cell probabilities are\ntheoretically shown to be consistent, and real data applications are included\nto support the findings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Jan 2013 07:19:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-07"}

We express the absolute\nposition of the sensors as an affine function of the Stiefel manifold and\npropose a simple least-squares (LS) estimator as well as a constrained total\nleast-squares (CTLS) estimator to jointly estimate the orientation and the\nposition of the rigid body. To account for the perturbations of the sensors, we\nalso propose a constrained total least-squares (CTLS) estimator. Analytical\nclosed-form solutions for the proposed estimators are provided. Simulations are\nused to corroborate and analyze the performance of the proposed estimators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Jan 2013 10:34:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 17 Mar 2013 18:17:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-19"}

Therefore, a Boltzmann probability distribution on\nthe countable set of forests in the graph is defined so that large (high-cost)\nforests occur with a low probability while short (low-cost) forests occur with\na high probability. Then, the SoF density index of a node is defined as the\nexpected outdegree of this node in a non-trivial tree of the forest, thus\nproviding a measure of density around that node. Following the matrix-forest\ntheorem, and a statistical physics framework, it is shown that the SoF density\nindex can be easily computed in closed form through a simple matrix inversion.\nExperiments on artificial and real data sets show that the proposed index\nperforms well on finding dense regions, for graphs of various origins.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Jan 2013 13:56:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-07"}

We show that\nthe extremes of so-called physical observables are distributed according to the\nclassical generalised Pareto distribution and derive explicit expressions for\nthe scaling and the shape parameter. In particular, we derive that the shape\nparameter does not depend on the chosen observables, but only on the partial\ndimensions of the invariant measure on the stable, unstable, and neutral\nmanifolds. The shape parameter is negative and is close to zero when\nhigh-dimensional systems are considered. This result agrees with what was\nderived recently using the generalized extreme value approach. Combining the\nresults obtained using such physical observables and the properties of the\nextremes of distance observables, it is possible to derive estimates of the\npartial dimensions of the attractor along the stable and the unstable\ndirections of the flow. Moreover, by writing the shape parameter in terms of\nmoments of the extremes of the considered observable and by using linear\nresponse theory, we relate the sensitivity to perturbations of the shape\nparameter to the sensitivity of the moments, of the partial dimensions, and of\nthe Kaplan-Yorke dimension of the attractor.

In this paper, we consider two\nimportant generalizations of $k$-center, the matroid center problem and the\nknapsack center problem. Both problems are motivated by recent content\ndistribution network applications. Our contributions can be summarized as\nfollows:\n  1. We consider the matroid center problem in which the centers are required\nto form an independent set of a given matroid. We show this problem is NP-hard\neven on a line. We present a 3-approximation algorithm for the problem on\ngeneral metrics. We also consider the outlier version of the problem where a\ngiven number of vertices can be excluded as the outliers from the solution. We\npresent a 7-approximation for the outlier version.\n  2. We consider the (multi-)knapsack center problem in which the centers are\nrequired to satisfy one (or more) knapsack constraint(s). It is known that the\nknapsack center problem with a single knapsack constraint admits a\n3-approximation. However, when there are at least two knapsack constraints, we\nshow this problem is not approximable at all. To complement the hardness\nresult, we present a polynomial time algorithm that gives a 3-approximate\nsolution such that one knapsack constraint is satisfied and the others may be\nviolated by at most a factor of $1+\\epsilon$.

The popular explanation in terms of 'ambiguity aversion' is not\ncompletely accepted. As a consequence, uncertainty is still problematical in\neconomics. To overcome these difficulties a distinction between 'risk' and\n'ambiguity' has been introduced which depends on the existence of a\nKolmogorovian probabilistic structure modeling these uncertainties. On the\nother hand, evidence of everyday life suggests that context plays a fundamental\nrole in human decisions under uncertainty. Moreover, it is well known from\nphysics that any probabilistic structure modeling contextual interactions\nbetween entities structurally needs a non-Kolmogorovian framework admitting a\nquantum-like representation. For this reason, we have recently introduced a\nnotion of 'contextual risk' to mathematically capture situations in which\nambiguity occurs. We prove in this paper that the contextual risk approach can\nbe applied to the Ellsberg paradox, and elaborate a sphere model within our\n'hidden measurement formalism' which reveals that it is the overall conceptual\nlandscape that is responsible of the disagreement between actual human\ndecisions and the predictions of expected utility theory, which generates the\nparadox.
