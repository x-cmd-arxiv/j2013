This consistent behavior strongly contrasts with\nthe difference in communication abilities between the individuals. Guided by\nthis universal feature, physicists have proposed that solely alignment rules at\nthe individual level could account for the emergence of unidirectional motion\nat the group level. This hypothesis has been supported by agent-based\nsimulations. However, more complex collective behaviors have been\nsystematically found in experiments including the formation of vortices,\nfluctuating swarms, clustering and swirling. All these model systems\npredominantly rely on actual collisions to display collective motion. As a\nresult, the potential local alignment rules are entangled with more complex,\noften unknown, interactions. The large-scale behavior of the populations\ntherefore depends on these uncontrolled microscopic couplings. Here, we\ndemonstrate a new phase of active matter. We reveal that dilute populations of\nmillions of colloidal rollers self-organize to achieve coherent motion along a\nunique direction, with very few density and velocity fluctuations. Identifying\nthe microscopic interactions between the rollers allows a theoretical\ndescription of this polar-liquid state. Comparison of the theory with\nexperiment suggests that hydrodynamic interactions promote the emergence of\ncollective motion either in the form of a single macroscopic flock at low\ndensities, or in that of a homogenous polar phase at higher densities.\nFurthermore, hydrodynamics protects the polar-liquid state from the giant\ndensity fluctuations. Our experiments demonstrate that genuine physical\ninteractions at the individual level are sufficient to set homogeneous active\npopulations into stable directed motion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Nov 2013 16:39:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-11"}

Periodically, the\ninformation must be synchronized, or reconciled. One can place this problem in\nthe theoretical framework of {\\em set reconciliation}: two parties $A_1$ and\n$A_2$ each hold a set of keys, named $S_1$ and $S_2$ respectively, and the goal\nis for both parties to obtain $S_1 \\cup S_2$. Typically, set reconciliation is\ninteresting algorithmically when sets are large but the set difference\n$|S_1-S_2|+|S_2-S_1|$ is small. In this setting the focus is on accomplishing\nreconciliation efficiently in terms of communication; ideally, the\ncommunication should depend on the size of the set difference, and not on the\nsize of the sets.\n  In this paper, we extend recent approaches using Invertible Bloom Lookup\nTables (IBLTs) for set reconciliation to the multi-party setting.

Further, our approach\ncan function even if the number of parties is not exactly known in advance, and\nin many cases can be used to determine which parties contain keys not in the\njoint union.

TIGER, a data analysis\npipeline which builds Bayesian evidence to support or question the validity of\nGR, has been written and tested. In particular, it was shown recently that data\nfrom the LIGO and Virgo detectors will allow to detect deviations from GR\nsmaller than can be probed with Solar System tests and pulsar timing\nmeasurements or not accessible with conventional tests of GR. However, evidence\nfrom several detections is required before a deviation from GR can be\nconfidently claimed. An interesting consequence is that, should GR not be the\ncorrect theory of gravity in its strong field regime, using standard GR\ntemplates for the matched filter analysis of interferometer data will introduce\nbiases in the gravitational wave measured parameters with potentially\ndisastrous consequences on the astrophysical inferences, such as the\ncoalescence rate or the mass distribution.

An unpumped\nSQUID acts as an inductance, the Josephson inductance, whereas a flux-pumped\nSQUID develops an additional, parallel element which we have coined the\n``pumpistor.''

For concreteness we assume the\nlatter to be characterized by an SO(5)/SO(4) symmetry with fermionic resonances\nin the SO(4) singlet and fourplet representations. Singlet partners dominantly\ndecay to a Higgs boson and jets. As no dedicated searches are currently looking\nfor these final states, singlet partners can still be rather light. Conversely,\nsome fourplet partners dominantly decay to an electroweak gauge boson and a\njet, a signature which has been analyzed at the LHC. To constrain the parameter\nspace of this scenario we have reinterpreted various LHC analyses. In the limit\nof first two generation degeneracy, as in minimal flavor violation or\nU(2)-symmetric flavor models, fourplet partners need to be relatively heavy,\nwith masses above 1.8 TeV, or the level of compositeness needs to be rather\nsmall. The situation is rather different in models that deviate from the first\ntwo generation degeneracy paradigm, as the charm parton distribution functions\nare suppressed relative to the up quark ones. The right-handed charm quark can\nbe composite and its partners being as light as 600 GeV, while the right-handed\nup quark needs either to be mostly elementary or to have its partners as heavy\nas 2 TeV. Models with fully composite singlet fermions are also analyzed,\nleading to similar conclusions. Finally, we consider the case where both the\nfourplet and the singlet states are present. In this case the bounds could be\nsignificantly weaken due to a combination of smaller production rates and the\nopening of new channels including cascade processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Nov 2013 21:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

We find that the M_star-M_halo relation is insensitive to numerical\ndetails, but is sensitive to the feedback physics.

The galaxy-averaged Kennicutt\nrelation is very different from the numerically imposed law for converting gas\ninto stars in the simulation, and is instead determined by self-regulation via\nstellar feedback.

The challenge\nlies in the gap between their overwhelming complexity and the limited database\nknowledge of non-professional users. If writing structured queries over simple\ntables is difficult, complex graphs are only harder to query. As an initial\nstep toward improving the usability of knowledge graphs, we propose to query\nsuch data by example entity tuples, without requiring users to form complex\ngraph queries. Our system, GQBE (Graph Query By Example), automatically derives\na weighted hidden maximal query graph based on input query tuples, to capture a\nuser's query intent. It efficiently finds and ranks the top approximate answer\ntuples. For fast query processing, GQBE only partially evaluates query graphs.\nWe conducted experiments and user studies on the large Freebase and DBpedia\ndatasets and observed appealing accuracy and efficiency. Our system provides a\ncomplementary approach to the existing keyword-based methods, facilitating\nuser-friendly graph querying.

The ability\nto benefit from such predictions depends not only on the ability to recognize\npatters in history, but also on the range of actions available to the decision\nmaker.\n  We assume there are two possible states of the world. The decision maker is a\ngambler who has to bet a certain amount of money on the bits of an announced\nbinary sequence of states.

It is crucial to understand that\nwhether the accelerating expansion of our universe at present is driven by an\nunknown energy component (Dark Energy) or a modification to general relativity\n(Modified Gravity). In this paper we study the coupled dark energy models, in\nwhich the quintessence scalar field nontrivially couples to the cold dark\nmatter, with the strength parameter of interaction $beta$. Using the Planck\ndata alone, we obtain that the strength of interaction between dark sectors is\nconstrained as $beta < 0.102$ at $95%$ confidence level, which is tighter than\nthat from the WMAP9 data alone. Combining the Planck data with other probes,\nlike the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO), Type-Ia supernovae ``Union2.1\ncompilation'' and the CMB lensing data from Planck measurement, we find the\ntight constraint on the strength of interaction $beta < 0.052$ ($95%$ C.L.).\nInterestingly, we also find a non-zero coupling $beta = 0.078 pm 0.022$ ($68%$\nC.L.) when we use the Planck, the ``SNLS'' supernovae samples, and the prior on\nthe Hubble constant from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) together.

It is shown that the new method\nsystematically leads to lower error levels regardless of the type of material.\nPros and cons of the new method vs. direct methods are also discussed,\ndemonstrating its efficiency in easily extracting mechanical properties with an\nenhanced confidence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Nov 2013 07:05:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Apr 2014 13:30:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-14"}

One critical mechanism was\nfound as that the atomized liquid metal microdroplets can be quickly oxidized\nin the air due to its large specific surface area, resulting in a significant\nincrease of the adhesive capacity and thus firm deposition of the ink to the\nsubstrate. This study established a generalized way for pervasively and\ndirectly printing electronics on various substrates which are expected to be\nsignificant in a wide spectrum of electrical engineering areas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Nov 2013 11:14:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

However, most existing models are\nadapted from biological epidemic ones. Although biological epidemic models can\ncertainly be adapted to capture some computer virus spreading scenarios\n(especially when the so-called homogeneity assumption holds), the problem of\ncomputer virus spreading is not well understood because it has many important\nperspectives that are not necessarily accommodated in the biological epidemic\nmodels. In this paper we initiate the study of such a perspective, namely that\nof adaptive defense against epidemic spreading in arbitrary networks. More\nspecifically, we investigate a non-homogeneous\nSusceptible-Infectious-Susceptible (SIS) model where the model parameters may\nvary with respect to time. In particular, we focus on two scenarios we call\nsemi-adaptive defense and fully-adaptive} defense, which accommodate implicit\nand explicit dependency relationships between the model parameters,\nrespectively. In the semi-adaptive defense scenario, the model's input\nparameters are given; the defense is semi-adaptive because the adjustment is\nimplicitly dependent upon the outcome of virus spreading. For this scenario, we\npresent a set of sufficient conditions (some are more general or succinct than\nothers) under which the virus spreading will die out; such sufficient\nconditions are also known as epidemic thresholds in the literature. In the\nfully-adaptive defense scenario, some input parameters are not known (i.e., the\naforementioned sufficient conditions are not applicable) but the defender can\nobserve the outcome of virus spreading. For this scenario, we present adaptive\ncontrol strategies under which the virus spreading will die out or will be\ncontained to a desired level.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Nov 2013 15:24:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 2 Apr 2016 03:48:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-08"}
