However, the\ncosmological principle of Universal homogeneity and isotropy has always been in\nquestion, since structures as large as the survey size have always been found\nas the survey size has increased. Until now, the largest known structure in our\nUniverse is the Sloan Great Wall (SGW), which is more than 400 Mpc long and\nlocated approximately one billion light-years away. Here we report the\ndiscovery of a structure at least six times larger than the Sloan Great Wall\nthat is suggested by the distribution of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Gamma-ray\nbursts are the most energetic explosions in the Universe. They are associated\nwith the stellar endpoints of massive stars and are found in and near distant\ngalaxies. Therefore, they are very good indicators of the dense part of the\nUniverse containing normal matter. As of July 2012, 283 GRB redshifts have been\nmeasured. If one subdivides this GRB sample into nine radial parts and compares\nthe sky distributions of these subsamples (each containing 31 GRBs), one can\nobserve that the fourth subsample (1.6 < z < 2.1) differs significantly from\nthe others in that many of the GRBs are concentrated in the same angular area\nof the sky. Using the two-dimensional Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, the significance\nof this observation is found to be less than 0.05 per cent. Fourteen out of the\n31 Gamma-Ray Bursts in this redshift band are concentrated in approximately 1/8\nof the sky. The binomial probability to find such a deviation is p=0.0000055.\nThis huge structure lies ten times farther away than the Sloan Great Wall, at a\ndistance of approximately ten billion light-years. The size of the structure\ndefined by these GRBs is about 2000-3000 Mpc, or more than six times the size\nof the largest known object (SGW) in the Universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Nov 2013 16:06:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-06"}

We choose isotopes of three rare-earth elements\n(W, Ho, Gd), which are known to be nearly perfect rotors, to perform a\nconsistent test of our conjecture on integrated cross sections as well as on\nangular distributions for elastic and inelastic neutron scattering. When doing\nthis we employ the well-established Koning-Delaroche global spherical potential\nand experimentally determined deformations without any adjustments. We observe\na dramatically improved agreement with experimental data compared to spherical\noptical model calculations. The effect of changing the OMP radius to preserve\nvolume integral is moderate but visibly improves agreement at lower incident\nenergies. We find that seven collective states need to be considered for the\ncoupled-channel calculations to converge. Our results for total, elastic,\ninelastic, and capture cross sections, as well as elastic and inelastic angular\ndistributions are in remarkable agreement with experimental data. This result\nconfirms that the adiabatic assumption holds and can extend applicability of\nthe global spherical OMP to rotational nuclei in the rare-earth region,\nessentially without any free parameter. Thus, quite reliable coupled-channel\ncalculations can be performed on such nuclei even when the experimental data,\nand consequently a specific coupled-channel potential, are not available.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Nov 2013 16:55:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 6 Feb 2014 21:00:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

In principle, it can be\nevaluated using known pedigrees, as IBD segments are by definition inherited\nwithout recombination down a family tree. We extracted 25,432 genotyped\nEuropean individuals containing 2,952 father-mother-child trios from the\n23andMe, Inc. dataset. We then used GERMLINE, a widely used IBD detection\nmethod, to detect IBD segments within this cohort. Exploiting known familial\nrelationships, we identified a false positive rate over 67% for 2-4 centiMorgan\n(cM) segments, in sharp contrast with accuracies reported in simulated data at\nthese sizes. Nearly all false positives arose from the allowance of haplotype\nswitch errors when detecting IBD, a necessity for retrieving long (> 6 cM)\nsegments in the presence of imperfect phasing. We introduce HaploScore, a\nnovel, computationally efficient metric that scores IBD segments proportional\nto the number of switch errors they contain. Applying HaploScore filtering to\nthe IBD data at a precision of 0.8 produced a 13-fold increase in recall when\ncompared to length-based filtering.

In practice the unknown field is\ndiscretized resulting in a problem in $\\mathbb{R}^N$, with an understanding\nthat refining the discretization, that is increasing $N$, will often be\ndesirable. In the context of Bayesian inversion this situation suggests the\nimportance of two issues: (i) defining hyper-parameters in such a way that they\nare interpretable in the continuum limit $N \\to \\infty$ and so that their\nvalues may be compared between different discretization levels; (ii)\nunderstanding the efficiency of algorithms for probing the posterior\ndistribution, as a function of large $N.$ Here we address these two issues in\nthe context of linear inverse problems subject to additive Gaussian noise\nwithin a hierarchical modelling framework based on a Gaussian prior for the\nunknown field and an inverse-gamma prior for a hyper-parameter, namely the\namplitude of the prior variance. The structure of the model is such that the\nGibbs sampler can be easily implemented for probing the posterior distribution.\nSubscribing to the dogma that one should think infinite-dimensionally before\nimplementing in finite dimensions, we present function space intuition and\nprovide rigorous theory showing that as $N$ increases, the component of the\nGibbs sampler for sampling the amplitude of the prior variance becomes\nincreasingly slower.

Clearly what we know about our planet will\nbe our guideline for the characterization of such planets. But the Earth has\nbeen inhabited for at least 3.8 Ga, and its appearance has changed with time.\nHere, we have studied the Earth during the Archean eon, 3.0 Ga ago. At that\ntime one of the more widespread life forms on the planet were purple bacteria.\nThese bacteria are photosynthetic microorganisms and can inhabit both aquatic\nand terrestrial environments. Here, we used a radiative transfer model to\nsimulate the visible and near-IR radiation reflected by our planet, taking into\naccount several scenarios regarding the possible distribution of purple\nbacteria over continents and oceans. We find that purple bacteria have a\nreflectance spectrum which has a strong reflectivity increase, similar to the\nred edge of leafy plants, although shifted redwards. This feature produces a\ndetectable signal in the disk-averaged spectra of our planet, depending on\ncloud amount and on purple bacteria concentration/distribution.

Binary hardening rates are also\nsubstantially lower than would be expected if the binary loss cone remained\nfull, as it would be if the orbits supplying stars to the binary were being\nefficiently replenished. The difference in binary hardening rates between the\nspherical and nonspherical models is less than a factor of two even in the\nsimulations with the largest N. By studying the orbital populations of our\nmodels, we conclude that the rate of supply of stars to the binary via draining\nof centrophilic orbits is indeed expected to be much lower than the\nfull-loss-cone rate, consistent with our simulations. We argue that the\nbinary's evolution in the simulations is driven in roughly equal amounts by\ncollisional and collisionless effects, even at the highest N-values currently\naccessible. While binary hardening rates would probably reach a limiting value\nfor large N, our results suggest that we cannot approach that rate with\ncurrently available algorithms and computing hardware. The extrapolation of\nresults from N-body simulations to real galaxies is therefore not\nstraightforward, casting doubt on recent claims that triaxiality or axisymmetry\nalone are capable of solving the final-parsec problem in gas-free galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Nov 2013 19:15:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Apr 2014 08:18:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

In this work, we provide analytic expressions\nfor five other effects which induce AP deviations: the photo-blend, -spot,\n-timing, -duration and -mass effects. We find that these effects can easily\nreproduce large AP deviations and so we caution that extracting the\neccentricity distribution is only viable with careful consideration of the\nprior distributions for these other effects.

This\nlatter result shows that the assumptions underlying the analytic model for the\nphoto-eccentric effect break down for close-in, highly-eccentric planets,\nmeaning that extreme care must be taken in this regime.

The processes of denitrification and anaerobic ammonium\noxidation (anammox) remove N from estuaries by producing di-nitrogen gas, and\neach can be coupled to N recycling pathways such as nitrification and\ndissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA). Environmental conditions in\nestuaries influence sedimentary N cycling processes; therefore, seawater\nintrusion may affect the coupling of N cycling processes in the freshwater\nportions of estuaries. This study investigated the potential effects of\nseawater intrusion on these process couplings through a comparative modeling\napproach. We applied environ analysis, a form of ecological network analysis,\nto two N cycling mass-balance network models constructed at freshwater\n(oligohaline) and saltwater (polyhaline) sites in the Cape Fear River Estuary,\nNorth Carolina. We used a space-for-time substitution to predict the effects of\nseawater intrusion on the sedimentary N cycle. Further, we conducted an\nuncertainty analysis using linear inverse modeling to evaluate the effects of\nparameterization uncertainty on model results. Nitrification coupled to both\ndenitrification and anammox was 2.5 times greater in the oligohaline model,\nwhile DNRA coupled to anammox was 2.7 times greater in the polyhaline model.\nHowever, the total amount of N2 gas produced relative to the nitrogen inputs to\neach network was 4.7% and 4.6% at the oligohaline and polyhaline sites,\nrespectively. These findings suggest that changes in water chemistry from\nseawater intrusion may favor direct over coupled nitrogen removal, but may not\nsubstantially change the N removal capacity of the sedimentary microbial\nprocesses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Nov 2013 19:32:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-16"}

The complex\nmulti-band nature of these materials makes the interplay of superconductivity\nwith spin and orbital dynamics very intriguing, leading to very material\ndependent magnetic excitations, and pairing symmetries. Here we use\nfirst-principles many-body method, including ab initio determined two-particle\nvertex function, to study the spin dynamics and superconducting pairing\nsymmetry in a large number of iron-based superconductors. In iron compounds\nwith high transition temperature, we find both the dispersive high-energy spin\nexcitations, and very strong low energy commensurate or nearly commensurate\nspin response, suggesting that these low energy spin excitations play the\ndominate role in cooper pairing. We find three closely competing types of\npairing symmetries, which take a very simple form in the space of active iron\n$3d$ orbitals, and differ only in the relative quantum mechanical phase of the\n$xz$, $yz$ and $xy$ orbital contributions. The extensively discussed s$^{+-}$\nsymmetry appears when contributions from all orbitals have equal sign, while\nthe opposite sign in $xz$ and $yz$ orbitals leads to the $d$ wave symmetry. A\nnovel orbital antiphase $s^{+-}$ symmetry emerges when $xy$ orbital has\nopposite sign to $xz$ and $yz$ orbitals.

Two strong shocks propagate at a constant velocity (which is\na small fraction of the velocity of the approaching stars) from the contact\nsurface toward the center of each star. The shocked region near the contact\nsurface has a planar symmetry and a uniform pressure. The density vanishes at\nthe (Lagrangian) surface of contact and the speed of sound diverges there. The\ntemperature, however, reaches a finite value, since as the density vanishes,\nthe finite pressure is radiation dominated. For Carbon-Oxygen white dwarfs\ncollisions this temperature is too low for any appreciable nuclear burning at\nearly times. The divergence of the speed of sound limits numerical studies of\nstellar collisions, as it makes convergence tests exceedingly expensive unless\ndedicated schemes are used.

By\nevaluating these corrections both in the bulk and in the CFT explicitly we show\nthat this expectation is indeed true.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Nov 2013 21:06:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 Apr 2014 05:50:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-15"}

For heavy quarks,\nwe employ the relativistic heavy quark (RHQ) action which can control large\ndiscretization errors introduced by large quark mass $m_Q$. The\nspin-independent central $Q\\bar{Q}$ potential for the charmonium system yields\nthe \"Coulomb plus linear'' behavior with good scaling and small volume\ndependence. We explore the quark mass dependence over the wide mass range from\nthe charm to beyond the bottom region, and then demonstrate that the\nspin-independent central $Q\\bar{Q}$ potential in the $m_Q \\to \\infty$ limit is\nfairly consistent with the static $Q\\bar{Q}$ potential obtained from Wilson\nloops. The spin-spin potential at finite quark mass provides a repulsive\ninteraction with a finite range, which becomes narrower as the quark mass\nincreases. We also discuss the applicability of the $1/m_Q$ expansion approach\nfor the spin-spin potential.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Nov 2013 23:59:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-26"}

Most of the\nliterature that addresses these questions assumes complete information: agents\nknow in advance the value of linking to other agents, even with agents they\nhave never met and with whom they have had no previous interaction (direct or\nindirect). This paper addresses the same questions under what seems to us to be\nthe much more natural assumption of incomplete information: agents do not know\nin advance -- but must learn -- the value of linking to agents they have never\nmet. We show that the assumption of incomplete information has profound\nimplications for the process of network formation and the topology of networks\nthat ultimately form. Under complete information, the networks that form and\nare stable typically have a star, wheel or core-periphery form, with high-value\nagents in the core. Under incomplete information, the presence of positive\nexternalities (the value of indirect links) implies that a much wider\ncollection of network topologies can emerge and be stable. Moreover, even when\nthe topologies that emerge are the same, the locations of agents can be very\ndifferent. For instance, when information is incomplete, it is possible for a\nhub-and-spokes network with a low-value agent in the center to form and endure\npermanently: an agent can achieve a central position purely as the result of\nchance rather than as the result of merit. Perhaps even more strikingly: when\ninformation is incomplete, a connected network could form and persist even if,\nwhen information were complete, no links would ever form, so that the final\nform would be a totally disconnected network. All of this can occur even in\nsettings where agents eventually learn everything so that information, although\ninitially incomplete, eventually becomes complete.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Nov 2013 01:30:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 10 Nov 2013 01:59:34 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 20 Nov 2013 23:20:54 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 20 Mar 2014 00:07:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-21"}

We call\nthis model the `EMMS-based turbulence model', and use it to construct the\ncorresponding turbulent viscosity coefficient. To validate the EMMS-based\nturbulence model, it is used to simulate two classical benchmark problems,\nlid-driven cavity flow and turbulent flow with forced convection in an empty\nroom. The numerical results show that the EMMS-based turbulence model improves\nthe accuracy of turbulence modeling due to it considers the principle of\ncompromise in competition between viscosity and inertia.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Nov 2013 02:19:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-20"}

It is well known that step-size is a critical parameter\nwhich controls three aspects: algorithm stability, estimation performance and\ncomputational cost.

However, most of the works are focused on the simple,\nthree-node model with two-way relaying, not taking into account the fact that\nthere can be other neighboring nodes that can cause/receive interference. The\nway to deal with this problem in distributed wireless networks is usage of\nMAC-layer mechanisms that make a spatial reservation of the shared wireless\nmedium, similar to the well-known RTS/CTS in IEEE 802.11 wireless networks. In\nthis paper, we investigate two-way relaying in presence of interfering nodes\nand usage of spatial reservation mechanisms. Specifically, we introduce a\nreserved area in order to protect the nodes involved in two-way relaying from\nthe interference caused by neighboring nodes. We analytically derive the\nend-to-end rate achieved by PLNC considering the impact of interference and\nreserved area. A relevant performance measure is data rate per unit area, in\norder to reflect the fact that any spatial reservation blocks another data\nexchange in the reserved area. The numerical results carry a cautionary message\nthat the gains brought by PLNC over one-way relaying may be vanishing when the\ntwo-way relaying is considered in a broader context of a larger wireless\nnetwork.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Nov 2013 09:57:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-18"}

Self-sustained activity states\nemerge when a small fraction of the synapses is strong enough to significantly\ninfluence the firing probability of a neuron, consistent with the recently\nproposed long-tailed distribution of synaptic weights. During self-sustained\nactivity, each neuron exhibits highly irregular firing patterns, similar to\nexperimentally observed activity.

As a very active star, AB Dor A shows frequent X-ray flaring, but,\nin the long XMM-Newton observations a kind of basal state is attained very\noften. This basal state probably varies with the photospheric activity-cycle of\nAB Dor A which has a period of ~17 years, but, the X-ray variability amounts at\nmost to a factor of ~2, which is, much lower than the typical cycle amplitudes\nfound on the Sun.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Nov 2013 13:15:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

However,\nmethods to quantify the influence of specific individuals on the behaviour of\nother group members and the direction of information flow in moving group, are\nlacking on the level of empirical studies and theoretical models. Using high\nspatio-temporal resolution GPS trajectories of foraging meerkats, Suricata\nsuricatta, we provide an information-theoretic framework to identify dynamical\ncoupling between animals independent of their relative spatial positions. Based\non this identification, we then compare designations of individuals as either\ndrivers or responders against designations provided by the relative spatial\nposition. We find that not only does coupling occur both from the frontal to\nthe trailing individuals and vice versa, but also that the coupling direction\nis a non-linear function of the relative position. This provides evidence for\n(i) intermittent fluctuation of the coupling strength and (ii) alternation in\nthe coupling direction within foraging meerkat pairs. The framework we\nintroduce allows for a detailed description of the dynamical patterns of mutual\ninfluence between all pairs of individuals within moving animal groups. We\nargue that applying an information-theoretic perspective to the study of\ncoordinated phenomena in animal groups will eventually help to understand cause\nand effect in collective behaviour.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Nov 2013 15:15:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-07"}

Under the presence of external electric fields\na rearrangement of $RA$ emission spectra is possible to associate with\nmanifestations of the Stark effect. The threshold for electric field ionization\nof $RA$ is $E\\approx3\\cdot10^{4}$ V/cm for states with $n>10$. This means that\nthe emission of $RA$ with $n\\ge10$ is effectively blocked for such fields. In\nthe region of lower electric field intensities the double Stark resonance (or\nF\\\"{o}rster resonance) becomes a key player. On this basis it is established\nthe fact that the static magnetic or electric fields may strongly affect the\nradiative constants of optical transitions in the vicinity of the F\\\"{o}ster\nresonance resulting, for instance, in an order of magnitude reduction of the\nintensity in some lines.

Problems occur at frequencies beyond those that define the first\npass band, associated in part with the difficulty of assigning a unique\nwavenumber to the wave. This problem is examined, paying careful attention to\nthe requirements of causality and passivity. The transmission of waves into a\nhalf-space is discussed by studying the impedance of the half-space, both\ndirectly and in the \"effective medium\" approximation, and an alternative way of\nlooking at this problem, based on construction of the Green's function, is\ndeveloped.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Nov 2013 19:26:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-18"}

Greedy recommendation,\nhowever, is suboptimal over the long term: it does not actively gather\ninformation on user preferences and fails to recommend novel songs that are\npotentially interesting. A successful recommender system must balance the needs\nto explore user preferences and to exploit this information for recommendation.\nThis paper presents a new approach to music recommendation by formulating this\nexploration-exploitation trade-off as a reinforcement learning task called the\nmulti-armed bandit. To learn user preferences, it uses a Bayesian model, which\naccounts for both audio content and the novelty of recommendations. A\npiecewise-linear approximation to the model and a variational inference\nalgorithm are employed to speed up Bayesian inference. One additional benefit\nof our approach is a single unified model for both music recommendation and\nplaylist generation. Both simulation results and a user study indicate strong\npotential for the new approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Nov 2013 12:20:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-26"}
