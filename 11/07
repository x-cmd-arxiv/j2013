The second version, established\nfar more recently by Cappelletti-Montano, De Nicola, and Yudin, holds for the\nDe Rham cohomology of a compact Sasakian manifold. In the current paper, using\nthe formalism of odd dimensional symplectic geometry, we prove a Hard Lefschetz\ntheorem for a compact $K$-contact manifold, which implies immediately that the\ntwo existing versions of Hard Lefschetz theorems are mathematically equivalent\nto each other.\n  Our method sheds new light on the Hard Lefschetz property of a Sasakian\nmanifold.

When data from\nmultiple related gene expression studies are available, separately analyzing\neach study is not an ideal strategy as it may fail to detect important genes\nwith consistent but relatively weak differential signals in multiple studies.\nJointly modeling all data allows one to borrow information across studies to\nimprove the analysis. However, a simple concordance model, in which each gene\nis assumed to be differential in either all studies or none of the studies, is\nincapable of handling genes with study-specific differential expression.

As a\nconsequence we greatly enlarge the number of genera $k$ for which the bound\n$SR_h(k) \\geq SR(k) \\gtrsim \\frac{4}{9\\pi} \\frac{\\log(k)^2}{k}$ is valid and\nshow that that $SR_h(k) \\leq \\frac{(\\log(195k)+8)^2}{\\pi(k-1)}$ for all $k \\geq\n76$. In Section 3 we expand on this idea. There we construct product manifolds\nwith large systolic ratio from lower dimensional manifolds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Nov 2013 17:12:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 25 Nov 2013 13:50:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 23 Dec 2013 16:11:07 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 20 May 2018 21:12:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-22"}

Louis de Broglie considers two solutions to the Schr\\\"odinger\nequation, a singular and physical wave u representing the particle (soliton\nwave) and a regular wave representing probability (statistical wave). We return\nto the idea of two solutions, but in the form of an interpretation of the wave\nfunction based on two different preparations of the quantum system. We\ndemonstrate the necessity of this double interpretation when the particles are\nsubjected to a semi-classical field by studying the convergence of the\nSchr\\\"odinger equation when the Planck constant tends to 0. For this\nconvergence, we reexamine not only the foundations of quantum mechanics but\nalso those of classical mechanics, and in particular two important paradox of\nclassical mechanics: the interpretation of the principle of least action and\nthe the Gibbs paradox. We find two very different convergences which depend on\nthe preparation of the quantum particles: particles called indiscerned\n(prepared in the same way and whose initial density is regular, such as atomic\nbeams) and particles called discerned (whose density is singular, such as\ncoherent states). These results are based on the Minplus analysis, a new branch\nof mathematics that we have developed following Maslov, and on the Minplus path\nintegral which is the analog in classical mechanics of the Feynman path\nintegral in quantum mechanics. The indiscerned (or discerned) quantum particles\nconverge to indiscerned (or discerned) classical particles and we deduce that\nthe de Broglie-Bohm pilot wave is the correct interpretation for the\nindiscerned quantum particles (wave statistics) and the Schr\\\"odinger\ninterpretation is the correct interpretation for discerned quantum particles\n(wave soliton).

This system is revealed to be one of the rare examples\nwhere both glassy states of matter, a structurally disordered supercooled\nliquid and an orientationally disordered plastic crystal, can be prepared in\nthe same material. Both disordered states can be easily supercooled, finally\narriving at a structural-glass or a glassy-crystal state. Detailed\ninvestigations using broadband dielectric spectroscopy enable a comparison of\nthe glassy dynamics in both phases. Just as previously demonstrated for\nsupercooled-liquid and plastic-crystalline ethanol, our experiments reveal very\nsimilar relaxational behavior and glass temperatures of both disordered states.\nThus the prominent role of orientational degrees of freedom in the glass\ntransition, suggested on the basis of the findings for ethanol, is fully\ncorroborated by the present work. Moreover, the fragilities of both phases are\ndetermined and compared for different mixtures. The findings can be well\nunderstood within an energy-landscape based explanation of fragility.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Nov 2013 18:05:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-05"}

We first explore the range of\nGRB phenomena that the propeller could potentially reproduce, using a series of\ntemplate light curves to devise a classification scheme based on phenomology.\nWe then obtain fits to the light curves of 9 GRBs with EE, simultaneously\nfitting both the propeller and the magnetic dipole spin-down and finding\ntypical disc masses of a few $10^{-3}$ $M_{\\odot}$ to a few $10^{-2}$\n$M_{\\odot}$. This is done for ballistic, viscous disc and exponential accretion\nrates. We find that the conversion efficiency from kinetic energy to EM\nemission for propellered material needs to be $\\gtrsim 10\\%$ and that the best\nfitting results come from an exponential accretion profile.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Nov 2013 21:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

Magnetic\nspin-down deposits a large fraction of the rotational energy from the magnetar\nbehind the small quantity of mass ejected during the merger. This has the\npotential for creating a bright transient that could be useful for determining\nwhether a NS or black hole was formed in the merger. We investigate the\nexpected signature of such an event, including for the first time the important\nimpact of electron/positron pairs injected by the millisecond magnetar into the\nsurrounding nebula.

Distributional semantics presupposes that the meanings of words are\na function of their occurrences in textual contexts. It models words as\ndistributions over these contexts and represents them as vectors in high\ndimensional spaces. The problem of compositionality for such models concerns\nitself with how to produce representations for larger units of text by\ncomposing the representations of smaller units of text.\n  This thesis focuses on a particular approach to this compositionality\nproblem, namely using the categorical framework developed by Coecke, Sadrzadeh,\nand Clark, which combines syntactic analysis formalisms with distributional\nsemantic representations of meaning to produce syntactically motivated\ncomposition operations. This thesis shows how this approach can be\ntheoretically extended and practically implemented to produce concrete\ncompositional distributional models of natural language semantics. It\nfurthermore demonstrates that such models can perform on par with, or better\nthan, other competing approaches in the field of natural language processing.\n  There are three principal contributions to computational linguistics in this\nthesis. The first is to extend the DisCoCat framework on the syntactic front\nand semantic front, incorporating a number of syntactic analysis formalisms and\nproviding learning procedures allowing for the generation of concrete\ncompositional distributional models. The second contribution is to evaluate the\nmodels developed from the procedures presented here, showing that they\noutperform other compositional distributional models present in the literature.\nThe third contribution is to show how using category theory to solve linguistic\nproblems forms a sound basis for research, illustrated by examples of work on\nthis topic, that also suggest directions for future research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Nov 2013 22:06:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-08"}

Our main result is that even relatively\ndense clouds that are radiatively heated (i.e., with significant absorption\nopacity) do not move as a whole instead they undergo a very rapid and major\nevolution in its shape, size and physical properties. In particular, the cloud\nand its remnants become optical thin within less than one sound crossing time\nand before they can travel over a significant distance (a distance of a few\nradii of the initial cloud). We also found that a cloud can be accelerated as a\nwhole under quite extreme conditions, e.g., the opacity must be dominated by\nscattering. However, the acceleration due to the radiation force is relatively\nsmall and unless the cloud is optically thin the cloud quickly changes its size\nand shape. We discuss implications for the modelling and interpetation broad\nline regions of active galactic nuclei.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Nov 2013 22:20:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

However, similar to other covering problems, minimum hub cover is\nNP-hard, and thus is a natural candidate for optimization.

For instance, a distributed storage system storing multiple replicas of\nthe data can serve a request from any of the multiple servers that store the\nrequested data, or a computational task may be performed in a compute-cluster\nby any one of multiple processors. In such systems, the latency of serving the\nrequests may potentially be reduced by sending \"redundant requests\": a request\nmay be sent to more servers than needed, and it is deemed served when the\nrequisite number of servers complete service. Such a mechanism trades off the\npossibility of faster execution of at least one copy of the request with the\nincrease in the delay due to an increased load on the system. Due to this\ntradeoff, it is unclear when redundant requests may actually help. Several\nrecent works empirically evaluate the latency performance of redundant requests\nin diverse settings.\n  This work aims at an analytical study of the latency performance of redundant\nrequests, with the primary goals of characterizing under what scenarios sending\nredundant requests will help (and under what scenarios they will not help), as\nwell as designing optimal redundant-requesting policies. We first present a\nmodel that captures the key features of such systems. We show that when service\ntimes are i.i.d. memoryless or \"heavier\", and when the additional copies of\nalready-completed jobs can be removed instantly, redundant requests reduce the\naverage latency. On the other hand, when service times are \"lighter\" or when\nservice times are memoryless and removal of jobs is not instantaneous, then not\nhaving any redundancy in the requests is optimal under high loads.
