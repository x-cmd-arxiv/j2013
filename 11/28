Aperture mass statistics are an appropriate\nchoice for 3rd-order statistics due to their simple form and their ability to\nseparate E- and B-modes of the shear. However, it has been demonstrated that\n2nd-order aperture mass statistics suffer from E-/B-mode mixing because it is\nimpossible to reliably estimate the shapes of close pairs of galaxies.

The slope is independent of morphology, incidence of bars,\nabsolute magnitude or mass. Only those galaxies with evidence of interactions\nand/or clear merging systems present a significant shallower gradient,\nconsistent with previous results. The majority of the 94 galaxies with H ii\nregions detected beyond 2 disk effective radii present a flattening in the\noxygen abundance. The flattening is statistically significant. We cannot\nprovide with a conclusive answer regarding the origin of this flattening.\nHowever, our results indicate that its origin is most probably related to the\nsecular evolution of galaxies.

The overall ellipticity/triangularity of events is\nvaried by selecting on the eccentricities $\\epsilon_n$ or the magnitudes of the\nflow vector $q_n$ for n=2 and 3, respectively. The responses of the $v_n$, the\nevent-plane correlations, and the rapidity fluctuations, to the change in\n$\\epsilon_n$ and $q_n$ are then systematized. Strong positive correlations are\nobserved among all even harmonics $v_2, v_4$, and $v_6$ (all increase with\n$q_2$), between $v_2$ and $v_5$ (both increase with $q_2$) and between $v_3$\nand $v_5$ (both increase with $q_3$), consistent with the effects of nonlinear\ncollective response.

In this thesis such\nclassification is generalized to manifolds of arbitrary dimension and\nsignature. This is accomplished by interpreting the Weyl tensor as a linear\noperator on the bundle of p-forms, for any p, and computing the Jordan\ncanonical form of this operator. Throughout this work the spaces are assumed to\nbe complexified, so that different signatures correspond to different reality\nconditions, providing a unified treatment. A higher-dimensional generalization\nof the so-called self-dual manifolds is also investigated.\n  The most important result related to the Petrov classification is the\nGoldberg-Sachs theorem. Here are presented two partial generalizations of such\ntheorem valid in even-dimensional manifolds. One of these generalizations\nstates that certain algebraic constraints on the Weyl operator imply the\nexistence of an integrable maximally isotropic distribution. The other version\nof the generalized Goldberg-Sachs theorem states that these algebraic\nconstraints imply the existence of a null congruence whose optical scalars obey\nspecial restrictions.\n  On the pursuit of these results the spinorial formalism in 6 dimensions was\ndeveloped from the very beginning, using group representation theory. Since the\nspinors are full of geometric significance and are suitable tools to deal with\nisotropic structures, it should not come as a surprise that they provide a\nfruitful framework to investigate the issues treated on this thesis.

How to characterize concordant signals between two rank lists is\na common problem with many applications. One example is measuring the\nreproducibility between two replicate experiments. Another is to characterize\nthe interaction and co-binding between two transcription factors (TF) based on\nthe overlap between their binding sites. As an exploratory tool, the simple\nVenn diagram approach can be used to show the common loci between two lists.\nHowever, this approach does not account for changes in overlap with decreasing\nranks, which may contain useful information for studying similarities or\ndissimilarities of the two lists. The recently proposed irreproducible\ndiscovery rate (IDR) approach compares two rank lists using a copula mixture\nmodel. This model considers the rank correlation between two lists. However, it\nonly analyzes the genomic loci that appear in both lists, thereby only\nmeasuring signal concordance in the overlapping set of the two lists. When two\nlists have little overlap but loci in their overlapping set have high\nconcordance in terms of rank, the original IDR approach may misleadingly claim\nthat the two rank lists are highly reproducible when they are indeed not. In\nthis article, we propose to address the various issues above by translating the\nproblem into a bivariate survival problem. A survival copula mixture model is\ndeveloped to characterize concordant signals in two rank lists. The\neffectiveness of this approach is demonstrated using both simulations and real\ndata.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Nov 2013 20:48:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-28"}

At high z the magnetic energy density in the\nradio lobes of powerful radio-loud quasars can be exceeded by the energy\ndensity of the CMB (because of its (1+z)^4 dependance). In this case,\nrelativistic electrons cool preferentially by scattering off CMB photons,\nrather than by synchrotron. Thus, sources sharing the same intrinsic properties\nhave different extended radio and X-ray luminosities when located at different\nz: more distant sources are less luminous in radio and more luminous in X-rays\nthan their closer counterparts. Instead, in compact regions where the local\nmagnetic field still exceeds the CMB in terms of energy density, synchrotron\nradiation would be unaffected by the presence of the CMB. Such regions include\nthe compact inner jet and the so-called hot spots in the radio lobes. The\ndecrease in radio luminosity is larger in misaligned sources, whose radio flux\nis dominated by the extended isotropic component. These sources can fail\ndetection in current flux limited radio surveys, and therefore they are\npossibly under-represented in the associated samples. As the cooling time is\nlonger for lower energy electrons, the radio luminosity deficit due to the CMB\nphotons is less important at low radio frequencies. Therefore objects not\ndetected so far in current surveys at a few GHz could be picked up by low\nfrequency deep surveys, such as LOFAR and SKA. Until then, we can estimate the\nnumber of high redshift radio-loud AGNs through the census of their aligned\nproxies, i.e., blazars. Indeed, their observed radio emission arises in the\ninner and strongly magnetized compact core of the relativistic jet, and not\naffected by inverse Compton scattering off CMB photons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Nov 2013 21:00:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 Dec 2013 14:48:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

X-ray spectra in all epochs are well fitted by a thermal\nemission model with kT > 7 keV. The somewhat high temperature suggests that the\nX-ray emission mainly arises from the circumstellar medium heated by the\nforward shock. We find that the spectra taken 2-3 years since the explosion are\nheavily absorbed N_H ~ 5e22 cm^{-2}, but the absorption gradually decreases to\nthe level of the Galactic absorption N_H ~ 4e20 cm^{-2} at the final epoch.\nThis indicates that the SN went off in a dense circumstellar medium and that\nthe forward shock has overtaken it.

The intrinsic\n0.2-10 keV luminosity during the plateau phase is measured to be ~1.5e41 erg/s,\nranking SN 2005ip as one of the brightest X-ray SNe.

Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) data have\nimposed constraints on the amplitude of strain spectrum for a power-law form as\na phenomenological model. Applying these constraints to a generic, theoretical\nspectrum with $r$ and $\\beta$ as independent parameters, we convert the PTAs\nconstraint into an upper bound on the index $\\beta$, which turns out to be less\nstringent than those upper bounds from BBN, CMB, and LIGO/VIRGO, respectively.\nMoreover, it is found that PTAs constrain the non-standard RGWs more stringent\nthan the standard RGWs. If the condition of the quantum normalization is\nimposed upon a theoretical spectrum of RGWs, $r$ and $\\beta$ become related.\nWith this condition, a minimum requirement of the horizon size during inflation\nis greater than the Planck length results in an upper bound on $\\beta$, which\nis comparable in magnitude to that by PTAs. When both PTAs and the quantum\nnormalization are applied to a theoretical spectrum of RGWs, constraints can be\nobtained for other cosmic processes of the early universe, such as the\nreheating, a process less understood observationally so far. The resulting\nconstraint is consistent with the slow-roll, massive scalar inflation model.\nThe future SKA will be able to constrain RGWs further and might even detect\nRGWs, rendering an important probe to the very early universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Nov 2013 03:12:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

For instance, researchers\ninvestigating the role of a prolonged duration of breastfeeding on child\noutcomes may be forced to make comparisons between women with substantially\ndifferent characteristics on average. In the extreme there may exist\nneighborhoods of the covariate space where there are not sufficient numbers of\nboth groups of women (those who breastfed for prolonged periods and those who\ndid not) to make inferences about those women. This is referred to as lack of\ncommon support. Problems can arise when we try to estimate causal effects for\nunits that lack common support, thus we may want to avoid inference for such\nunits. If ignorability is satisfied with respect to a set of potential\nconfounders, then identifying whether, or for which units, the common support\nassumption holds is an empirical question. However, in the high-dimensional\ncovariate space often required to satisfy ignorability such identification may\nnot be trivial. Existing methods used to address this problem often require\nreliance on parametric assumptions and most, if not all, ignore the information\nembedded in the response variable. We distinguish between the concepts of\n\"common support\" and common causal support.\" We propose a new approach for\nidentifying common causal support that addresses some of the shortcomings of\nexisting methods. We motivate and illustrate the approach using data from the\nNational Longitudinal Survey of Youth to estimate the effect of breastfeeding\nat least nine months on reading and math achievement scores at age five or six.\nWe also evaluate the comparative performance of this method in hypothetical\nexamples and simulations where the true treatment effect is known.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Nov 2013 09:31:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-02"}

However, other observables\nappear to be only weakly affected by nuclear quantum effects (NQEs): for\ninstance, the melting temperatures of light and heavy water differ by less than\n4 K. Recent theoretical work has attributed this to a competition between intra\nand inter molecular NQEs, which can be separated by computing the anisotropy of\nthe quantum kinetic energy tensor. The principal values of this tensor change\nin opposite directions when ice melts, leading to a very small net quantum\nmechanical effect on the melting point. This paper presents the first direct\nexperimental observation of this phenomenon, achieved by measuring the\ndeuterium momentum distributions n(p) in heavy water and ice using Deep\nInelastic Neutron Scattering (DINS), and resolving their anisotropy. Results\nfrom the experiments, supplemented by a theoretical analysis, show that the\nanisotropy of the quantum kinetic energy tensor can also be captured for\nheavier atoms such as oxygen.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Nov 2013 09:35:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-02"}

The asymptotic properties of the estimators are presented and\nexamined through simulation studies. The proposed restricted mean job duration\nestimators are shown to be robust in the presence of an independent frailty\nterm. Data from the reverse discrimination case, Alexander v. Milwaukee, where\nWhite-male lieutenants were discriminated in promotion to captain are\nreanalyzed. While the appellate court upheld liability, it reversed the\noriginal damage calculations, which heavily depended on the time a plaintiff\nwould have been in each position. The results obtained by the proposed method\nare compared to those made at the first trial.

In\nthis work, we propose and investigate two setups derived from a superconducting\nquantum interference device (SQUID), where two conventional Josephson junctions\nare replaced by two HJLs. In the first setup, the HJLs share the same resonant\nmode, while in the second setup two separate resonant modes of the two lasers\nare coupled optically. We dub the setup `light-superconducting interference\ndevice' (LSID).\n  In both setups, we find the operating regimes similar to those of a single\nHJL. Importantly, the steady lasing field is significantly affected by the\nmagnetic flux penetrating the SQUID loop, with respect to both amplitude and\nphase. This provides opportunities to tune or even quench the lasing by varying\na small magnetic field.\n  For the second setup, we find a parameter range where the evolution equation\nfor the laser fields supports periodic cycles. The fields are thus modulated\nwith the frequency of the cycle resulting in an emission spectrum consisting of\na set of discrete modes. From this spectrum, two modes dominate in the limit of\nstrong optical coupling. Therefore, the LSID can be also used to generate such\nmodulated light.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Nov 2013 10:35:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

Materials containing rotation\nsymmetries forbidden in crystals can be optionally described as quasicrystals\nwith aperiodicity.

However, it is unknown if such pseudo-crystals with 5-fold symmetry\nexist in reality.

Parrondo's game consists of two individual games, game A\nand game B. Game A is a slightly losing coin-tossing game. Game B has two\ncoins, with an integer parameter $M$. If the current cumulative capital (in\ndiscrete unit) is a multiple of $M$, an unfavorable coin $p_b$ is used,\notherwise a favorable $p_g$ coin is used. Paradoxically, combination of game A\nand game B could lead to a winning game, which is the Parrondo effect. We\nextend the original Parrondo's game to include the possibility of $M$ being\neither $M_1$ or $M_2$. Also, we distinguish between strong Parrondo effect,\ni.e. two losing games combine to form a winning game, and weak Parrondo effect,\ni.e. two games combine to form a better-performing game. We find that when\n$M_2$ is not a multiple of $M_1$, the combination of $B(M_1)$ and $B(M_2)$ has\nstrong and weak Parrondo effect for some subsets in the parameter space\n$(p_b,p_g)$, while there is neither strong nor weak effect when $M_2$ is a\nmultiple of $M_1$. Furthermore, when $M_2$ is not a multiple of $M_1$,\nstochastic mixture of game A may cancel the strong and weak Parrondo effect.\nFollowing a discretization scheme in the literature of Parrondo's game, we\nestablish a link between our extended Parrondo's game with the analysis of\ndiscrete Brownian ratchet. We find a relation between the Parrondo effect of\nour extended model to the macroscopic bias in a discrete ratchet. The slope of\na ratchet potential can be mapped to the fair game condition in the extended\nmodel, so that under some conditions, the macroscopic bias in a discrete\nratchet can provide a good predictor for the game performance of the extended\nmodel. On the other hand, our extended model suggests a design of a ratchet in\nwhich the potential is a mixture of two periodic potentials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Nov 2013 12:31:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 May 2014 06:32:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-27"}

The interplay between stresses arising from\nmembrane elasticity, hydrodynamic flows, and the ever present thermal\nfluctuations leads to a rich phenomenology. In linear flows with both\nrotational and elongational components, the properties of the tank-treading and\ntumbling motions are now well described by theoretical and numerical models. At\nthe transition between these two regimes, strong shape deformations and\namplification of thermal fluctuations generate a new regime called trembling.\nIn this regime, the vesicle orientation oscillates quasi-periodically around\nthe flow direction while asymmetric deformations occur. For strong enough\nflows, small-wavelength deformations like wrinkles are observed, similar to\nwhat happens in a suddenly reversed elongational flow. In steady elongational\nflow, vesicles with large excess areas deform into dumbbells at large flow\nrates and pearling occurs for even stronger flows. In capillary flows with\nparabolic flow profile, single vesicles migrate towards the center of the\nchannel, where they adopt symmetric shapes, for two reasons. First, walls exert\na hydrodynamic lift force which pushes them away. Second, shear stresses are\nminimal at the tip of the flow. However, symmetry is broken for vesicles with\nlarge excess areas, which flow off-center and deform asymmetrically. In\nsuspensions, hydrodynamic interactions between vesicles add up to these two\neffects, making it challenging to deduce rheological properties from the\ndynamics of individual vesicles. Further investigations of vesicles and similar\nobjects and their suspensions in steady or time-dependent flow will shed light\non phenomena such as blood flow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Nov 2013 15:28:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 5 Feb 2014 17:04:09 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 13 Mar 2014 08:21:20 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 18 Mar 2014 14:21:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-12"}

The existence of this\nconservation law is connected to the symmetry properties of the dynamics under\nsimultaneous inversion of magnetisation and time. When one applies an external\nmagnetic field parallel to the spin polarization, the dynamics is transformed\nfrom conservative into dissipative. More precisely, it is demonstrated that\nthere exists a state function such that the field induces a monotone relaxation\nof this function toward its minima or maxima, depending on the field\norientation. These results hold in the absence of intrinsic damping effects.\nWhen intrinsic damping is included in the description, a competition arises\nbetween field-induced and damping-induced relaxations, which leads to the\nappearance of limit cycles, that is, of magnetization self-oscillations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Nov 2013 15:50:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

Our aim was to analyse imaging and spectroscopy from multiple\ndifferent sources using a single self-consistent radiative-transfer model to\nassess the magnitude of seasonal variability. Globally-averaged stratospheric\ntemperatures measured from methane emission tend towards a quasi-isothermal\nstructure (158-164 K) above the 0.1-mbar level, and are found to be consistent\nwith spacecraft observations of AKARI.
