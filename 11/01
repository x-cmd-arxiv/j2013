In these frameworks, relations over terms representing\nformal objects are naturally captured by making use of the dependent structure\nof types. We consider here the meaning-preserving translation of specifications\nwritten in this style into a predicate logic over simply typed {\\lambda}-terms.\nSuch a translation can provide the basis for efficient implementation and\nsophisticated capabilities for reasoning about specifications. We start with a\npreviously described translation of LF specifications to formulas in the logic\nof higher-order hereditary Harrop (hohh) formulas. We show how this translation\ncan be improved by recognizing and eliminating redundant type checking\ninformation contained in it. This benefits both the clarity of translated\nformulas, and reduces the effort which must be spent on type checking during\nexecution. To allow this translation to be used to execute LF specifications,\nwe describe an inverse transformation from hohh terms to LF expressions; thus\ncomputations can be carried out using the translated form and the results can\nthen be exported back into LF. Execution based on LF specifications may also\ninvolve some forms of type reconstruction. We discuss the possibility of\nsupporting such a capability using the translation under some reasonable\nrestrictions on the structure of specifications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Oct 2013 16:10:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-01"}

We measure\nrelative atmospheric parameters and elemental abundances of a late-F type dwarf\nsample (52 stars) and a sample of metal-rich solar analogs (59 stars). We\ndetect refractory-element depletions with amplitudes up to about 0.15 dex. The\ndistribution of depletion amplitudes for stars known to host gas giant planets\nis not different from that of the rest of stars. The maximum amplitude of\ndepletion increases with effective temperature from 5650 K to 5950 K, while it\nappears to be constant for warmer stars (up to 6300 K). The depletions observed\nin solar twin stars have a maximum amplitude that is very similar to that seen\nhere for both of our samples. Gas giant planet formation alone cannot explain\nthe observed distributions of refractory-element depletions, leaving the\nformation of rocky material as a more likely explanation of our observations.\nMore rocky material is necessary to explain the data of solar twins than\nmetal-rich stars, and less for warm stars.

Its characteristic signature is the biphasic kill curve,\nwhereby microbes exposed to a bactericidal agent are initially killed very\nrapidly but then much more slowly. Here we relate this problem to the more\ngeneral problem of understanding the emergence of distinct growth phenotypes in\nclonal populations. We address the problem mathematically by adopting the\nframework of the phenomenon of so-called weak ergodicity breaking, well known\nin dynamical physical systems, which we extend to the biological context. We\nshow analytically and by direct stochastic simulations that distinct growth\nphenotypes can emerge as a consequence of slow-down of stochastic fluctuations\nin the expression of a gene controlling growth rate. In the regime of fast gene\ntranscription, the system is ergodic, the growth rate distribution is unimodal,\nand accounts for one phenotype only. In contrast, at slow transcription and\nfast translation, weakly non-ergodic components emerge, the population\ndistribution of growth rates becomes bimodal, and two distinct growth\nphenotypes are identified. When coupled to the well-established growth rate\ndependence of antibiotic killing, this model describes the observed fast and\nslow killing phases, and reproduces much of the phenomenology of bacterial\npersistence. The model has major implications for efforts to develop control\nstrategies for persistent infections.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Oct 2013 17:07:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

A case study examining accidental deaths in the Finnish\npopulation is provided.\n  We further extend the applicability of the catastrophe risk model by\nconsidering small and big accidents separately; the resulting combined MPP\nmodel can flexibly capture the whole range of accidental death counts. Using\nthe proposed model, we present a simulation framework for pricing (life)\ncatastrophe reinsurance, based on modeling the underlying policies at\nindividual contract level. The accidents are first simulated at population\nlevel, and their effect on a specific insurance company is then determined by\nexplicitly simulating the resulting insured deaths. The proposed\nmicrosimulation approach can potentially lead to more accurate results than the\ntraditional methods, and to a better view of risk, as it can make use of all\nthe information available to the re/insurer and can explicitly accommodate even\ncomplex re/insurance terms and product features. As an example we price several\nexcess reinsurance contracts. The proposed simulation model is also suitable\nfor solvency assessment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Oct 2013 17:26:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-01"}

The lifetime sharply\nincreases with Reynolds number so that a possible divergence marking the\ntransition to sustained turbulence at a critical point has been discussed. We\npresent a mechanism by which the lifetimes increase: in the system's state\nspace, turbulent motion is supported by a chaotic saddle. Inside this saddle a\nlocally attracting periodic orbit is created and undergoes a traditional\nbifurcation sequence generating chaos. The formed new 'turbulent bubble' is\ninitially an attractor supporting persistent chaotic dynamics. Soon after its\ncreation it collides with its own boundary, by which it becomes leaky and\ndynamically connected with the surrounding structures. The complexity of the\nchaotic saddle that supports transient turbulence hence increases by\nincorporating the remnant of a new bubble. As a a result, the time it takes for\na trajectory to leave the saddle and decay to the laminar state is increased.\nWe demonstrate this phenomenon in plane Couette flow and show that\ncharacteristic lifetimes vary non-smoothly and non-monotonically with Reynolds\nnumber.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Oct 2013 17:38:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-24"}

This decrease in the age-specific incidence\nwith age is an anomaly. Understanding this anomaly should lead to a better\nunderstanding of how tumors develop and grow.

Among those are trade-offs\nbetween different ways an organism utilizes resources, and these trade-offs can\nconstrain the manner in which selection can optimize traits. Limited migration\namong allopatric populations and species interactions can also drive\nspeciation, but here we ask if trade-offs alone are sufficient to drive\nspeciation in the absence of other factors. We present a model to study the\neffects of trade-offs on specialization and adaptive radiation in asexual\norganisms based solely on competition for limiting resources, where trade-offs\nare stronger the greater an organism's ability to utilize resources. In this\nmodel resources are perfectly substitutable, and fitness is derived from the\nconsumption of these resources. The model contains no spatial parameters, and\nis therefore strictly sympatric. We quantify the degree of specialization by\nthe number of ecotypes formed and the niche breadth of the population, and\nobserve that these are sensitive to resource influx and trade-offs. Resource\ninflux has a strong effect on the degree of specialization, with a clear\ntransition between minimal diversification at high influx and multiple species\nevolving at low resource influx. At low resource influx the degree of\nspecialization further depends on the strength of the trade-offs, with more\necotypes evolving the stronger trade-offs are. The specialized organisms\npersist through negative frequency-dependent selection. In addition, by\nanalyzing one of the evolutionary radiations in greater detail we demonstrate\nthat a single mutation alone is not enough to establish a new ecotype, even\nthough phylogenetic reconstruction identifies that mutation as the branching\npoint.

The minimum (or critical) core mass to form a gas\ngiant is typically quoted as 10 Earth masses. The actual value depends on\nseveral factors: the location in the protoplanetary disk, atmospheric opacity,\nand the accretion rate of solids. Motivated by ongoing direct imaging searches\nfor giant planets, this study investigates core mass requirements in the outer\ndisk. To determine the fastest allowed rates of gas accretion, we consider\nsolid cores that no longer accrete planetesimals, as this would heat the\ngaseous envelope. Our spherical, two-layer atmospheric cooling model includes\nan inner convective region and an outer radiative zone that matches onto the\ndisk. We determine the minimum core mass for a giant planet to form within a\ntypical disk lifetime of 3 Myr. The minimum core mass declines with disk\nradius, from ~8.5 Earth masses at 5 AU to ~3.5 Earth masses at 100 AU, with\nstandard interstellar grain opacities. Lower temperatures in the outer disk\nexplain this trend, while variations in disk density are less influential. At\nall distances, a lower dust opacity or higher mean molecular weight reduces the\ncritical core mass.

We quantify the trade-off with a general inequality that paints\nan unexpectedly intricate picture of wave-particle duality when internal states\nare involved. Strikingly, in some instances which-way information becomes\nerased by introducing classical uncertainty in the internal degree of freedom.\nFurthermore, even imperfect interference visibility measured for a suitable set\nof spin preparations can be sufficient to infer absence of which-way\ninformation.

The signal rates are\ncompared to the expected and observed cross section limits from the Higgs\nsearches to determine whether a point in the model parameter space is excluded\nat 95% confidence level.

Focusing on black holes with equal-magnitude angular momenta, we\ndetermine the domain of existence of these black holes. Non-extremal black\nholes reside with the boundaries determined by the static and the extremal\nrotating black holes. The extremal EMd black holes show proportionality of\ntheir horizon area and their angular momenta. Thus the charge does not enter.\nWe also address the Einstein-Maxwell case, where the extremal rotating black\nholes exhibit two branches. On the branch emerging from the Myers-Perry\nsolutions their angular momenta are proportional to their horizon area, whereas\non the branch emerging from the static solutions their angular momenta are\nproportional to their horizon angular momenta. Only subsets of the near-horizon\nsolutions are realized globally. Investigating the physical properties of these\nEMd black holes, we note that one can learn much about the extremal rotating\nsolutions from the much simpler static solutions. The angular momenta of the\nextremal black holes are proportional to the area of the static ones for the\nKaluza-Klein value of the dilaton coupling constant, and remain analogous for\nother values. The same is found for the horizon angular velocities of the\nextremal black holes, which possess an analogous behavior to the surface\ngravity of the static black holes.

As a consequence, two\ndifferent constitutive relationships, corresponding to the grain to grain\ncontact and bulk behavior, co-exist in a constitutive model and govern the\nresponse of the model. To be specific, grain to grain sliding under dry or wet\ncondition is idealized and appears as a simple contact law embedded in a\ncontinuum framework. There is no need to define plastic strain, as this\nquantity naturally emerges at the continuum scale as the consequence of\nfrictional sliding at the lower scale. In addition, the effective stress can be\nnaturally worked out from the grain to grain contact law embedded in the model\nwithout being subjected to any interpretation.

The division is useful in part because the\nJaranowski-Krolak-Schutz (JKS) coordinates on the four-dimensional amplitude\nparameter space allow the GW signal to be written as a linear combination of\nfour template waveforms with the JKS coordinates as coefficients. We define a\nnew set of coordinates on the amplitude parameter space, with the same\nproperties, which is more closely connected to the physical amplitude\nparameters. These naturally divide into two pairs of Cartesian-like coordinates\non two-dimensional subspaces, one corresponding to left- and the other to\nright-circular polarization.

The corresponding two sets of polar\ncoordinates (known as CPF-polar) can be related in a simple way to the physical\nparameters.

An important performance measure for\nthese counting processes is their variance curve, indicating the variance of\nthe number of served customers over a time interval. Recent work has revealed\nsome non-trivial properties dealing with the asymptotic rate at which the\nvariance curve grows. In this paper we add to the results by finding explicit\nexpressions for the second order approximation of the variance curve, namely\nthe y-intercept of the linear asymptote.\n  For M/M/1/K queues our results are based on the Drazin inverse of the\ngenerator. It turns out that by viewing output processes as MAPs (Markovian\nArrival Processes) and considering the Drazin inverse, one can obtain explicit\nexpressions for the y-intercept, together with some further insight regarding\nthe BRAVO effect (Balancing Reduces Asymptotic Variance of Outputs). For M/G/1\nqueues our results are based on a classic transform of D.J. Daley. In this case\nwe represent the y-intercept of the variance curve in terms of the first three\nmoments of the service time distribution.\n  A further performance measure that we are able to calculate for both models,\nis the asymptotic covariance between the queue length and the number of\narrivals or departures. In addition we shed light on a classic conjecture of\nDaley, dealing with characterization of stationary M/M/1 queues within the\nclass of stationary M/G/1 queues, based on the variance curve.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Nov 2013 01:18:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-04"}

We consider the general case where the dielectric\nconstants of the plate and the electrolyte are distinct. The following generic\nresults emerge from our analyses: (1) If the distance to the plate $\\Delta z$\nis much larger than a Gouy-Chapman length, the plate surface will behave\neffectively as an infinitely charged surface, and the dielectric constant of\nthe plate effectively plays no role. (2) If $\\Delta z$ is larger than a\nGouy-Chapman length but shorter than a Debye length, the correlation potential\ncan be interpreted in terms of an image charge that is three times larger than\nthe source charge. This behavior is independent of the valences of the ions.\n(3) The Green's function vanishes inside the plate if the surface charge\ndensity is infinitely large; hence the electrostatic potential is constant\nthere. In this respect, a strongly charged plate behaves like a conductor\nplate. (4) If $\\Delta z$ is smaller than a Gouy-Chapman length, the correlation\npotential is dominated by the conventional image charge due to the dielectric\ndiscontinuity at the interface.

The re-sampling method is\nbased on the semi-parametric sieve approach, whereby the dynamics in the\nprocess used to produce the bootstrap draws are captured by an autoregressive\napproximation. Application of the sieve method to data pre-filtered by a\nsemi-parametric estimate of the long memory parameter is also explored.\nHigher-order improvements yielded by both forms of re-sampling are demonstrated\nusing Edgeworth expansions for a broad class of statistics that includes first-\nand second-order moments, the discrete Fourier transform and regression\ncoefficients. The methods are then applied to the problem of estimating the\nsampling distributions of the sample mean and of selected sample\nautocorrelation coefficients, in experimental settings. In the case of the\nsample mean, the pre-filtered version of the bootstrap is shown to avoid the\ndistinct underestimation of the sampling variance of the mean which the raw\nsieve method demonstrates in finite samples, higher order accuracy of the\nlatter notwithstanding. Pre-filtering also produces gains in terms of the\naccuracy with which the sampling distributions of the sample autocorrelations\nare reproduced, most notably in the part of the parameter space in which\nasymptotic normality does not obtain. Most importantly, the sieve bootstrap is\nshown to reproduce the (empirically infeasible) Edgeworth expansion of the\nsampling distribution of the autocorrelation coefficients, in the part of the\nparameter space in which the expansion is valid.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Nov 2013 06:14:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-08"}

The transverse and\nlongitudinal spin relaxations are discussed both analytically and numerically.\nFor the transverse configuration, it is found that the spin relaxation is very\nsensitive to the Hartree-Fock effective magnetic field, which is very different\nfrom the conventional D'yakonov-Perel' spin relaxation. Even an extremely small\nspin polarization ($P=0.1\\%$) can significantly influence the behavior of the\nspin relaxation.

The decay\nproperty of Fourier coefficients magnitude of the fBm signals/ fields indicates\nthat fBms are compressible. Therefore, a few numbers of samples will be\nsufficient for a CS based method to reconstruct the full field. The\neffectiveness of the proposed method is showed by simulating, random sampling,\nand reconstructing CV-fBm fields. Performance evaluation shows advantages of\nthe proposed method over boxcar filtering and thin plate methods. It is also\nfound that the reconstruction performance depends on both of the fBm's Hurst\nparameter and the number of samples, which in fact is consistent with the CS\nreconstruction theory. In contrast to other fBm or fractal interpolation\nmethods, the proposed CS based method does not require the knowledge of fractal\nparameters in the reconstruction process; the inherent sparsity is just\nsufficient for the CS to do the reconstruction. Potential applicability of the\nproposed method in weak gravitational lensing survey, particularly for\ninterpolating non-smooth PSF (Point Spread Function) distribution representing\ndistortion by a turbulent field is also discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Nov 2013 09:11:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-05"}

We show that the dust extinction of the objects where the\ndiffuse interstellar band at 5780 Angstroms is detected is consistent with the\nvisual extinction derived from the supernova colors. This strongly suggests\nthat the dust producing the extinction is predominantly located in the\ninterstellar medium of the host galaxies and not in circumstellar material\nassociated with the progenitor system. One quarter of the supernovae display\nanomalously large Na I column densities in comparison to the amount of dust\nextinction derived from their colors. Remarkably, all of the cases of unusually\nstrong Na I D absorption correspond to \"Blueshifted\" profiles in the\nclassification scheme of Sternberg et al. (2011). This coincidence suggests\nthat outflowing circumstellar gas is responsible for at least some of the cases\nof anomalously large Na I column densities.

The filter is then applied to experimental\ndata sets from ESAR and FSAR sensors (DLR) at L-band and S-band, respectively.\nThese last experiments show the ability of the filter to restore structures\nsuch as buildings and roads and to preserve boundaries between regions while\nachieving a high amount of smoothing in homogeneous areas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Nov 2013 12:20:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-04"}

TRAPHIC solves the radiative transfer\nequation by tracing photon packets at the speed of light and in a\nphoton-conserving manner in spatially adaptive smoothed particle hydrodynamics\nsimulations.

This property is called the \"collapse of\nthe wave function\" and was formulated by Von Neumann as one of the postulates\nof quantum mechanics. However, it remains unclear at what point in time and\nunder what laws this transition occurs. This article demonstrates that the\ncollapse of the wave function may be due to the creation or annihilation of\nparticles (quasi-particles). The processes of the creation or annihilation of\nparticles play a key role in the measurements and are described on the basis of\nquantum field theory. The system of equations of quantum field theory of\nparticles and fields is non-linear; as a result, the principle of superposition\ndoes not hold for the theory. The collapse of the wave function is a\nconsequence of this non-linearity and occurs at the moment of creation\n(annihilation) of a particle. This result demonstrates that the wave function\ncollapse can occur in both microscopic and macroscopic systems. Understanding\nthe mechanisms of the collapse of the wave function can lead to the creation of\nmicroscopic devices involved in the calculations based on quantum computing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Nov 2013 15:20:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-04"}
