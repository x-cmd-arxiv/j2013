Such causets are well-behaved and have a rigid geometry that is\ndetermined by a sequence of positive integers called the shell sequence. We\nfirst consider the microscopic picture. In this picture, the vertices of a\nc-causet have integer labels that are unique up to a label isomorphism. This\nlabeling enables us to define a natural metric $d(a,b)$ between time-like\nseparated vertices $a$ and $b$. The time metric $d(a,b)$ results in a natural\ndefinition of a geodesic from $a$ to $b$. It turns out that there can be $n\\ge\n1$ such geodesics. Letting $a$ be the origin (the big bang), we define the\ncurvature $K(b)$ of $b$ to be $n-1$. Assuming that particles tend to move along\ngeodesics, $K(b)$ gives the tendency that vertex $b$ is occupied. In this way,\nthe mass distribution is determined by the geometry of the c-causet. We next\nconsider the macroscopic picture which describes the growth process of\nc-causets. We propose that this process is governed by a quantum dynamics given\nby complex amplitudes.

They are however subject, like any other\nobservables, to instrumental effects which must be properly accounted for to\nextract meaningful physics results. We compare the merits of several techniques\nused towards measurement of these correlation functions in nuclear collisions.\nWe discuss and distinguish the effects of finite acceptance, and detection\nefficiency that may vary with collision parameters such as the position of the\nevent in the detector and the instantaneous luminosity of the beam. We focus in\nparticular on instrumental effects which break the factorization of the\nparticle pair detection efficiency, and describe a technique to recover the\nrobustness of correlation observables. We finally introduce a multi-dimensional\nweight method to correct for efficiencies that vary simultaneously with\nparticle pseudo rapidity, azimuthal angle, transverse momentum, and the\ncollision vertex position. The method can be generalized to account for any\nnumber of \"event variables\" that may break the factorability of the pair\nefficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Nov 2013 16:38:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 26 Jan 2014 18:17:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-26"}

Two different\ndivertor scenarios are considered. The first is characterized by an energy flux\nperpendicular to the plate $q_0\\simeq 1$ MW/m$^2$ typical of current\nshort-pulse tokamaks. The second has $q_0\\simeq 10$ MW/m$^2$ and is relevant to\nlong-pulse machines like ITER or DEMO.\n  It is shown that micrometer dust particles can survive rather easily near the\nplates of a divertor plasma with $q_0\\simeq 1$ MW/m$^2$ because thermal\nradiation provides adequate cooling for the dust particle. On the other hand,\nthe survivability of micrometer dust particles near the divertor plates is\ndrastically reduced when $q_0\\simeq 10$ MW/m$^2$. Micrometer dust particles\nredeposit their material non-locally, leading to a net poloidal mass migration\nacross the divertor.

The\ngalactic yellow hypergiant IRC +10420 is a cornerstone system for understanding\nthis phase, since it is the strongest post-RSG candidate known, has\ndemonstrated real-time evolution across the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram and\nbeen subject to extensive mass loss. Here we report on the discovery of a twin\nof IRC +10420 - IRAS 18357-0604. Optical and near-IR spectroscopy are used to\ninvestigate the physical properties of IRAS 18357-0604, while IR photometry\nprobes the nature of its circumstellar environment. Pronounced spectral\nsimilarities between IRAS 18357-0604 and IRC +10420 suggest comparable\ntemperatures and wind geometries, while photometric data reveals a similarly\ndusty circumstellar environment, although historical mass loss appears to have\nbeen heavier in IRC +10420. The systemic velocity implies a distance compatible\nwith the red supergiant dominated complex at the base of the Scutum Crux arm;\nthe resultant luminosity determination is consistent with a physical\nassociation but suggests a lower initial mass than inferred for IRC +10420\n(<20Msun versus ~40Msun).

We quantify this\nsensitivity, and discuss conditions that must be satisfied if observable\npredictions are to be insensitive to the dynamics of reheating. We demonstrate\nthat upon completion of reheating, all observable quantities take values within\nfinite ranges, the limits of which are determined completely by the conditions\nduring inflation.

The range of valence bonds\nwithin this linear combination as well as the correlations between them can\nreveal the nature of the singlet state, and are key ingredients in variational\ncalculations. In this work, we study the bipartite valence bond distributions\nand their correlations within the ground state of the Heisenberg\nantiferromagnet on bipartite lattices. In terms of field theory, this problem\ncan be mapped to correlation functions near a boundary. In dimension d >= 2, a\nnon-linear sigma model analysis reveals that at long distances the probability\ndistribution P(r) of valence bond lengths decays as |r|^(-d-1) and that valence\nbonds are uncorrelated. By a bosonization analysis, we also obtain P(r)\nproportional to |r|^(-d-1) in d=1 despite the different mechanism. On the other\nhand, we find that correlations between valence bonds are important even at\nlarge distances in d=1, in stark contrast to d >= 2. The analytical results are\nconfirmed by high-precision quantum Monte Carlo simulations in d=1, 2, and 3.\nWe develop a single-projection loop variant of the valence bond projection\nalgorithm, which is well-designed to compute valence bond probabilities and for\nwhich we provide algorithmic details.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Nov 2013 21:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Apr 2014 05:55:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-11"}

These effects are\nthe subject of this paper, where we adopt a Monte-Carlo simulation for the\nchanges in the direction of the angular momentum of a galaxy disc as it\naccretes matter based on accurate measurements from dark-matter haloes in the\nMillennium II simulation. In our semi-analytic model implementation, the flips\nseen the dark matter haloes are assumed to be the same for the cold baryons;\nhowever, we also assume that in the latter the flip also entails a difficulty\nfor the disc to increase its angular momentum which causes the disc to become\nsmaller relative to a no-flip case. This makes star formation to occur faster,\nspecially in low mass galaxies at all redshifts allowing galaxies to reach\nhigher stellar masses faster. We adopt a new condition for the triggering of\nstarbursts during mergers. As these produce the largest flips it is natural to\nadopt the disc instability criterion to evaluate the triggering of bursts in\nmergers instead of one based on mass ratios as in the original model. The new\nimplementation reduces the average lifetimes of discs by a factor of 2, while\nstill allowing old ages for the present-day discs of large spiral galaxies. It\nalso provides a faster decline of star formation in massive galaxies and a\nbetter fit to the bright end of the luminosity function at z = 0.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Nov 2013 21:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Jul 2014 14:14:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

A 3D slice of the quasicrystal contains a few\ntypes of prototiles. An initial structure is obtained by decorating these\nprototiles with tetrahedra. This initial structure is then modified using the\nElser-Sloane quasicrystal itself as a guide. The second approach proceeds by\ndecorating the prolate and oblate rhombohedra in a 3-dimensional Ammann tiling.\nThe resulting quasicrystal has a packing density of 59.783%.

Trying to address these issues, the notion of geo-indistinguishability\nwas recently introduced, adapting the well-known concept of Differential\nPrivacy to the area of location-based systems. A Laplace-based obfuscation\nmechanism satisfying this privacy notion works well in the case of a sporadic\nuse; Under repeated use, however, independently applying noise leads to a quick\nloss of privacy due to the correlation between the location in the trace.\n  In this paper we show that correlations in the trace can be in fact exploited\nin terms of a prediction function that tries to guess the new location based on\nthe previously reported locations. The proposed mechanism tests the quality of\nthe predicted location using a private test; in case of success the prediction\nis reported otherwise the location is sanitized with new noise. If there is\nconsiderable correlation in the input trace, the extra cost of the test is\nsmall compared to the savings in budget, leading to a more efficient mechanism.\n  We evaluate the mechanism in the case of a user accessing a location-based\nservice while moving around in a city.

Third,\nwe introduce suitable modifications of this heuristic that provide new methods,\novercoming the existing procedures with a proven FDP control.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Nov 2013 07:35:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 Jun 2014 14:15:26 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 5 Jun 2015 09:24:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-08"}

This is traditionally done using an exponential\nfunction with a constant discount rate, which reduces the present value of\nfuture costs. The result is highly sensitive to the choice of discount rate and\nhas generated a major controversy as to the urgency for immediate action. We\nstudy analytically several standard interest rate models from finance and\ncompare their properties to empirical data. From historical time series for\nnominal interest rates and inflation covering 14 countries over hundreds of\nyears, we find that extended periods of negative real interest rates are\ncommon, occurring in many epochs in all countries. This leads us to choose the\nOrnstein-Uhlenbeck model, in which real short run interest rates fluctuate\nstochastically and can become negative, even if they revert to a positive mean\nvalue. We solve the model in closed form and prove that the long-run discount\nrate is always less than the mean; indeed it can be zero or even negative,\ndespite the fact that the mean short term interest rate is positive. We fit the\nparameters of the model to the data, and find that nine of the countries have\npositive long run discount rates while five have negative long-run discount\nrates.

We argue that SMBH growth is dominated by accretion\nof dense cold clumps and filaments. AGN feedback outflows overtake the cold\nmedium, compress it, and trigger a powerful starburst -- a positive AGN\nfeedback. This predicts a statistical correlation between AGN luminosity and\nstar formation rate at high luminosities. Most of the outflow's kinetic energy\nescapes from the bulge via low density voids. The cold phase is pushed outward\nonly by the ram pressure (momentum) of the outflow. The combination of the\nnegative and positive forms of AGN feedback leads to an $M-\\sigma$ relation\nsimilar to the result of King (2003). Due to porosity of cold ISM in the bulge,\nSMBH influence on the low density medium of the host galaxy is significant even\nfor SMBH well below the $M-\\sigma$ mass. The role of SMBH feedback in our model\nevolves in space and time with the ISM structure. In the early gas rich phase,\nSMBH accelerates star formation in the bulge. During later gas poor\n(red-and-dead) phases, SMBH feedback is mostly negative everywhere due to\nscarcity of the cold ISM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Nov 2013 17:24:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}
