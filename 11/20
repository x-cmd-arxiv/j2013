We find that mini halos (such as in Perseus and\nOphiuchus) can be explained by radio-emitting electrons that are generated in\nhadronic cosmic ray (CR) interactions with protons of the intracluster medium.\nBy contrast, the hadronic model either fails to explain the extended emission\nof giant radio halos (as in Coma at low frequencies) or would require a flat CR\nprofile, which can be realized through outward streaming and diffusion of CRs\n(in Coma and A2163 at 1.4 GHz). We suggest that a second, leptonic component\ncould be responsible for the missing flux in the outer parts of giant halos\nwithin a new hybrid scenario and we describe its possible observational\nconsequences. To study the hadronic emission component of the radio halo\npopulation statistically, we use a cosmological mock galaxy cluster catalog\nbuilt from the MultiDark simulation. Because of the properties of CR streaming\nand the different scalings of the X-ray luminosity (L_X) and the\nSunyaev-Zel'dovich flux (Y) with gas density, our model can simultaneously\nreproduce the observed bimodality of radio-loud and radio-quiet clusters at the\nsame L_X as well as the unimodal distribution of radio-halo luminosity versus\nY; thereby suggesting a physical solution to this apparent contradiction.

However, most of the previous work in WSN has used CS under the\nassumption that data field is smooth with negligible white Gaussian noise. In\nthese schemes signal sparsity is estimated globally based on the entire data\nfield, which is then used to determine the CS parameters. In more realistic\nscenarios, where data field may have regional fluctuations or it is piecewise\nsmooth, existing CS based data aggregation schemes yield poor compression\nefficiency. In order to take full advantage of CS in WSNs, we propose an\nAdaptive Hierarchical Data Aggregation using Compressive Sensing (A-HDACS)\nscheme.

Using molecular dynamics simulations we study the\nself-assembly of tubular structures from model macromolecular monomers with\nmultiple binding sites on their surfaces [Cheng et al., Soft Matter 8,\n5666-5678 (2012)]. In this work we add chirality to the model monomer and a\nlock-and-key interaction. The self-assembly of free monomers into tubules\nyields a pitch value that often does not match the chirality of the monomer\n(including achiral monomers). We show that this mismatch occurs because of a\ntwist deformation that brings the lateral interaction sites into alignment when\nthe tubule pitch differs from the monomer chirality. The energy cost for this\ndeformation is small as the energy distributions substantially overlap for\nsmall differences in the pitch and chirality. In order to control the tubule\npitch by preventing the twist deformation, the interaction between the vertical\nsurfaces must be increased without resulting in kinetically trapped structures.\nFor this purpose, we employ the lock-and-key interactions and obtain good\ncontrol of the self-assembled tubule pitch. These results explain some\nfundamental features of microtubules. The vertical interaction strength is\nlarger than the lateral in microtubules because this yields a controlled\nassembly of tubules with the proper pitch. We also generally find that the\ncontrol of the assembly into tubules is difficult, which explains the wide\nrange of pitch and protofilament number observed in microtubule assembly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Nov 2013 18:28:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-10"}

In the case of an ideal single-photon detector, the contribution of\nphoton noise to the statistics of the registered signal has been thoroughly\nexamined. However, practical photon counters have a dead time, leading to\nmiscounting of certain true events, and sometimes the counters generate false\nafter-pulses.\n  This study investigate the impact of these two effects, and it presents the\ntheoretical relations between the statistical moments of the radiation and the\nregistered counts while also accounting for dead time and the probability of\nafter-pulses. Expressions for statistical moments of any order are obtained on\nthe basis of the generalized Poisson distribution (GPD).

The\npublished radial velocities for this star are re-analyzed and evidence is found\nfor additional periodic signals, which could be taken for two additional\nplanets on eccentric orbits. Such systems are not dynamically viable and break\nup quickly in numerical integrations. Limiting the scope to the two originally\ndetected planets, we assess the dynamical stability of the system and find no\nevidence for bounded chaos in the orbital motion. The orbital eccentricity of\nthe planets b and c is found to change cyclicly in the range 0.06 - 0.28 and\n0.05 - 0.25, respectively, with a period of approximately 0.46 yr. Taking the\neccentricity variation into account, numerical integrations are performed of\nthe differential equations modeling the spin-orbit interaction of the planet GJ\n667Cc with its host star assuming a terrestrial composition of its mantle.\nDepending on the interior temperature of the planet, it is likely to be\nentrapped in the 3:2 (probability 0.51) or even higher spin-orbit resonance.

This arrives when\none desires to learn, from a source distribution, a good weighted majority vote\n(over a set of classifiers) on a different target distribution. In this\ncontext, the disagreement between classifiers is known crucial to control. In\nnon-DA supervised setting, a theoretical bound - the C-bound - involves this\ndisagreement and leads to a majority vote learning algorithm: MinCq. In this\nwork, we extend MinCq to DA by taking advantage of an elegant divergence\nbetween distribution called the Perturbed Varation (PV).

In a previous work [V. C. Barbosa, R.\nDonangelo, and S. R. Souza, J. Theor. Biol. 312, 114 (2012)], we introduced a\nnetwork model of quasispecies dynamics, based on a single probability parameter\n($p$) and capable of addressing several plausibility issues of previous models.\nHere we extend that model by pairing its network with another one aimed at\nmodeling the dynamics of the immune system when confronted with the\nquasispecies. The new network is based on the idiotypic-network model of\nimmunity and, together with the previous one, constitutes a network model of\ninteracting genotypes and idiotypes. The resulting model requires further\nparameters and as a consequence leads to a vast phase space. We have focused on\na particular niche in which it is possible to observe the trade-offs involved\nin the quasispecies' survival or destruction. Within this niche, we give\nsimulation results that highlight some key preconditions for quasispecies\nsurvival. These include a minimum initial abundance of genotypes relative to\nthat of the idiotypes and a minimum value of $p$. The latter, in particular, is\nto be contrasted with the stand-alone quasispecies network of our previous\nwork, in which arbitrarily low values of $p$ constitute a guarantee of\nquasispecies survival.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Nov 2013 20:03:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-20"}

Based on\nX-ray modeling these \"X-ray new-type\", or low observed X-ray scattering\n(hereafter:\"low-scattering\") sources have been interpreted as deeply-buried AGN\nwith a high covering factor of gas. In this paper we address the questions\nwhether the host galaxies of low-scattering AGN may contribute to the observed\nX-ray properties, and whether we can find any direct evidence for high covering\nfactors from the infrared (IR) emission. We find that X-ray low-scattering AGN\nare preferentially hosted by highly-inclined galaxies or merger systems as\ncompared to other Seyfert galaxies, increasing the likelihood that the\nline-of-sight toward the AGN intersects with high columns of host-galactic gas\nand dust. Moreover, while a detailed analysis of the IR emission of\nlow-scattering AGN ESO 103-G35 remains inconclusive, we do not find any\nindication of systematically higher dust covering factors in a sample of\nlow-scattering AGN based on their IR emission. For ESO 103-G35, we constrained\nthe temperature, mass and location of the IR emitting dust which is consistent\nwith expectations for the dusty torus. However, a deep silicate absorption\nfeature probably from much cooler dust suggests an additional screen absorber\non larger scales within the host galaxy. Taking these findings together, we\npropose that the low f_scat observed in low-scattering AGN is not necessarily\nthe result of circumnuclear dust but could originate from interference of\nhost-galactic gas with a column density of the order of 10^22 cm^-2 with the\nline-of-sight.

We show that\nsignificant differences exist between them especially when trying to model the\nBaryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO). We find that the best available model of\nthe BAO in real space is the Zel'dovich Approximation (ZA), giving an accuracy\nof <~3% at redshift of z=0 in modelling the matter 2-pt function around the\nacoustic peak. All corrections to the ZA around the BAO scale are perfectly\nperturbative in real space. Any attempt to achieve better precision requires\ncalibrating the theory to simulations because of the need to renormalize those\ncorrections. In contrast, theories which do not fully preserve the ZA as their\nsolution, receive O(1) corrections around the acoustic peak in real space at\nz=0, and are thus of suspicious convergence at low redshift around the BAO. As\nan example, we find that a similar accuracy of 3% for the acoustic peak is\nachieved by Eulerian Standard Perturbation Theory (SPT) at linear order only at\nz~4. Thus even when SPT is perturbative, one needs to include loop corrections\nfor z<~4 in real space. In Fourier space, all models perform similarly, and are\ncontrolled by the overdensity amplitude, thus recovering standard results.\nHowever, that comes at a price. Real space cleanly separates the BAO signal\nfrom non-linear dynamics. In contrast, Fourier space mixes signal from short\nmildly non-linear scales with the linear signal from the BAO to the level that\nnon-linear contributions from short scales dominate. Therefore, one has little\nhope in constructing a systematic theory for the BAO in Fourier space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Nov 2013 21:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 Nov 2013 17:49:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

The templates map the waveform shapes to physical\nparameters, thus allowing us to produce posterior probability distributions for\nthese parameters. However, there are attendant dangers in using highly\nrestrictive signal priors. If strong field gravity is not accurately described\nby General Relativity (GR), then using GR templates may result in fundamental\nbias in the recovered parameters, or even worse, a complete failure to detect\nsignals. Here we study such dangers, concentrating on three distinct\npossibilities. First, we show that there exist modified theories compatible\nwith all existing tests that would fail to be detected by the LIGO/Virgo\nnetwork using searches based on GR templates, but which would be detected using\na one parameter post-Einsteinian extension. Second, we study modified theories\nthat produce departures from GR that turn on suddenly at a critical frequency,\nproducing waveforms that do not naively fit into the simplest parameterized\npost-Einsteinian (ppE) scheme. We show that even the simplest ppE templates are\nstill capable of picking up these strange signals and diagnosing a departure\nfrom GR. Third, we study whether using inspiral-only ppE waveforms for signals\nthat include merger and ringdown can lead to problems in misidentifying a GR\ndeparture. We present an easy technique that allows us to self-consistently\nidentify the inspiral portion of the signal, and thus remove these potential\nbiases, allowing GR tests to be performed on higher mass signals that merge\nwithin the detector band. We close by studying a parameterized waveform model\nthat may allow us to test GR using the full inspiral-merger-ringdown signal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Nov 2013 21:38:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 20 Mar 2014 21:14:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-26"}

Hysteresis can be viewed as form of the system's persistent memory of\npast environmental conditions, while bet-hedging is a diversification strategy\nnot necessarily associated with any memory. It has been shown that bet-hedging\ncan increase population growth when phenotype adjusts its switching probability\nin response to environmental inputs. Although memory and hysteresis have been\nused to generate environment dependent phenotype switching probabilities, their\nexact connection to bet-hedging have remained unclear. In this work, using a\nsimple model that takes into account phenotype switching as well as lag phase\nin the population growth occurring after the phenotype switching, it is shown\nthat memory and hysteresis emerge naturally and are firmly linked to\nbet-hedging as organisms attempt to optimize their population growth rate. The\noptimal ``magnitude'' of hysteresis is explained to be associated with\nstochastic resonance where the characteristic time between subsequent phenotype\nswitching events is linked to the lag phase delay. Furthermore, hysteretic\nswitching strategy is shown not to confer any additional population growth\nadvantage if the environment varies periodically in a deterministic fashion.\nThis suggests that, while bet-hedging may evolve under some conditions even in\ndeterministic environments, memory and hysteresis is probably the result of\nenvironmental uncertainty in the presence of lag phase in the switching of\nphenotypes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Nov 2013 23:38:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

Traditionally, they are included in a\nmean-field description of atomic nuclei through the approximate\nBardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer or Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov formalism. Purpose: We\npropose a new hybrid ''relativistic-mean-field-plus-pairing'' approach in which\npairing is treated exactly so the number of particles is conserved. To verify\nthe reliability of the formalism, we apply it to the study of both ground-state\nproperties and isoscalar monopole excitations of the Tin isotopes. Methods:\nAccurately-calibrated relativistic mean-field models supplemented by an exact\ntreatment of pairing correlations are used to compute ground-state observables\nalong the isotopic chain in Tin. In turn, ground-state densities are used as\ninput to the calculation of giant monopole resonances through a\nconstrained-relativistic approach. Results: We compute a variety of\nground-state observables sensitive to pairing correlations as well as the\nevolution of giant monopole energies along the isotopic chain in Tin. Whereas\nground-state properties are consistent with experiment, we find that pairing\ncorrelations have a minor effect on the giant monopole energies. Conclusions: A\nnew mean-field-plus-pairing approach is introduced to compute properties of\nopen-shell nuclei. The formalism provides an efficient and powerful alternative\nto the computation of both ground-state properties and monopole energies of\nopen-shell nuclei. We find ground-state properties to be well reproduced in\nthis approach. However, as many have concluded before us, we find that pairing\ncorrelations are unlikely to provide an answer to the question of ''why is Tin\nso soft?''\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Nov 2013 00:41:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

A common manifestation of\nthis style is the notion of a package, which groups a set of commonly used\nclasses together. A challenge in using a package is to ensure that a client\nfollows the implicit protocol of the package when calling its methods.\nViolations of the protocol can cause a runtime error or latent invariant\nviolations. These protocols can extend across different, potentially\nunboundedly many, objects, and are specified informally in the documentation.\nAs a result, ensuring that a client does not violate the protocol is hard.\n  We introduce dynamic package interfaces (DPI), a formalism to explicitly\ncapture the protocol of a package. The DPI of a package is a finite set of\nrules that together specify how any set of interacting objects of the package\ncan evolve through method calls and under what conditions an error can happen.\nWe have developed a dynamic tool that automatically computes an approximation\nof the DPI of a package, given a set of abstraction predicates. A key property\nof DPI is that the unbounded number of configurations of objects of a package\nare summarized finitely in an abstract domain. This uses the observation that\nmany packages behave monotonically: the semantics of a method call over a\nconfiguration does not essentially change if more objects are added to the\nconfiguration. We have exploited monotonicity and have devised heuristics to\nobtain succinct yet general DPIs. We have used our tool to compute DPIs for\nseveral commonly used Java packages with complex protocols, such as JDBC,\nHashSet, and ArrayList.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Nov 2013 01:58:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 19 Jan 2014 03:12:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-21"}

In TDCS-based CRNs, each\nuser is assigned a specific pseudorandom spreading sequence. However, the\nexistence of multiuser interference (MUI) is one of main concerns, due to the\nnon-zero cross-correlations between any pair of TDCS signals. In this paper, a\nnovel framework of TDCS-based CRNs with the joint design of sequences and\nmodulation schemes is presented to realize MUI avoidance. With the uncertainty\nof spectrum sensing results in CRNs, we first introduce a unique sequence\ndesign through two-dimensional time-frequency synthesis and obtain a class of\nalmost perfect sequences. That is, periodic auto-correlation and\ncross-correlations are identically zero for most circular shifts. These\ncorrelation properties are further exploited in conjunction with a\nspecially-designed cyclic code shift keying in order to achieve the advantage\nof MUI avoidance. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed TDCS-based\nCRNs are considered as preferable candidates for decentralized networks against\nthe near-far problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Nov 2013 06:42:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-14"}

For\nnoisy optimization tasks, evolutionary algorithms (EAs), a kind of stochastic\nmetaheuristic search algorithm, have been widely and successfully applied.\nPrevious work mainly focuses on empirical studying and designing EAs for noisy\noptimization, while, the theoretical counterpart has been little investigated.\nIn this paper, we investigate a largely ignored question, i.e., whether an\noptimization problem will always become harder for EAs in a noisy environment.\nWe prove that the answer is negative, with respect to the measurement of the\nexpected running time. The result implies that, for optimization tasks that\nhave already been quite hard to solve, the noise may not have a negative\neffect, and the easier a task the more negatively affected by the noise. On a\nrepresentative problem where the noise has a strong negative effect, we examine\ntwo commonly employed mechanisms in EAs dealing with noise, the re-evaluation\nand the threshold selection strategies. The analysis discloses that the two\nstrategies, however, both are not effective, i.e., they do not make the EA more\nnoise tolerant. We then find that a small modification of the threshold\nselection allows it to be proven as an effective strategy for dealing with the\nnoise in the problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Nov 2013 09:28:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-21"}

We\nvary the degree of magnetization, the halo mass, and the amount of explosion\nenergy in order to account for expected variations as well as to infer\nsystematical dependencies of the results on initial conditions. Our simulations\nsuggest that core collapse supernovae with an explosion energy of 10^51 erg and\nmore violent pair instability supernovae with 10^53 erg are able to disrupt\nhalos with masses up to a about 10^6 and 10^7 M_sun, respectively. The peak of\nthe magnetic field spectra shows a continuous shift towards smaller k-values,\ni.e. larger length scales, over time reaching values as low as k = 4. On small\nscales the magnetic energy decreases at the cost of the energy on large scales\nresulting in a well-ordered magnetic field with a strength up to ~ 10^-8 G\ndepending on the initial conditions. The coherence length of the magnetic field\ninferred from the spectra reaches values up to 250 pc in agreement with those\nobtained from autocorrelation functions.

Here we study\nsuch \"peri-merger\" detonations by means of numerical simulations, modeling the\ndisruption and nucleosynthesis of the stars until the ejecta reach the coasting\nphase.

The more massive mergers produce unusually luminous\nSNe Ia with peak luminosities approaching those attributed to\n\"super-Chandrasekhar\" mass SNe Ia. While the synthetic light curves and spectra\nof some of the models resemble observed SNe Ia, the significant asymmetry of\nthe ejecta leads to large orientation effects. The peak bolometric luminosity\nvaries by more than a factor of 2 with the viewing angle, and the velocities of\nthe spectral absorption features are lower when observed from angles where the\nlight curve is brightest. The largest orientation effects are seen in the\nultraviolet, where the flux varies by more than an order of magnitude. Despite\nthe large variation with viewing angle, the set of three models roughly obeys a\nwidth-luminosity relation, with the brighter light curves declining more slowly\nin the B-band. Spectral features due to unburned carbon from the secondary star\nare also seen in some cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Nov 2013 10:49:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

Such a function is\nsaid to be in the Schur--Agler class if it is contractive when evaluated on any\ncommutative $d$-tuple of strict contractions on a Hilbert space. It is known\nthat the Schur--Agler class is a strictly proper subclass of the Schur class if\nthe number of variables $d$ is more than two. The Schur--Agler class is also\ncharacterized as those functions arising as the transfer function of a certain\ntype (Givone--Roesser) of conservative multidimensional linear system.

The idea consists of a nested iterative loop where the\nconfigurational space of the electrons in the QMC procedure is determined by a\ntrial oneparticle electron density; this allows then for the determination of a\nfirst guess for the energy functional, which is then in turn used for a DFT\nminimization process. This latter delivers a new electron density and the loop\nis repeated iteratively until convergence is reached and thus the electronic\nstructure of the system determined. In essence, from the applied point of view,\nsuch an approach is a compromise between the large computational cost but high\naccuracy of QMC and the reasonable computational cost but lower accuracy of\nDFT. The proposed approach goes beyond the standard Kohn-Sham method, which is\nthe standard in DFT, and requires neither orbitals nor the a priori\nspecification of the exchange and correlation functional. From the conceptual\npoint of view, the relevant aspect is that the 3N-dimensional wavefunction is\nderived as a function(al) of the three-dimensional electron density, which is\nthe key principle of DFT.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Nov 2013 11:31:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-22"}

There are a several experimental evidences which confirm the\nimportance of nuclear deformation on the fusion. The influence of nuclear\ndeformation is straightforward. If the target nucleus is prolate in the ground\nstate, the Coulomb field on its tips is lower than on its sides, that then\nincreases the capture or fusion probability at energies below the barrier\ncorresponding to the spherical nuclei. The role of neutron transfer reactions\nis less clear. The importance of neutron transfer with positive Q-values on\nnuclear fusion (capture) originates from the fact that neutrons are insensitive\nto the Coulomb barrier and therefore they can start being transferred at larger\nseparations before the projectile is captured by target-nucleus. Therefore, it\nis generally thought that the sub-barrier fusion cross section will increase\nbecause of the neutron transfer. The fusion (capture) dynamics induced by\nloosely bound radioactive ion beams is currently being extensively studied.\nHowever, the long-standing question whether fusion (capture) is enhanced or\nsuppressed with these beams has not yet been answered unambiguously. The study\nof the fusion reactions involving nuclei at the drip-lines has led to\ncontradictory results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Nov 2013 11:33:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

A low-mass, common proper motion companion\n(Fom b), was discovered near the inner edge and was identified as a planet\ncandidate that could account for the belt morphology. However, the most recent\norbit determination based on four epochs of astrometry over eight years reveals\na highly eccentric orbit that appears to cross the belt in the sky plane\nprojection. We perform here a full orbital determination based on the available\nastrometric data to independently validate the orbit estimates previously\npresented. Adopting our values for the orbital elements and their associated\nuncertainties, we then study the dynamical interaction between the planet and\nthe dust ring, to check whether the proposed disk sculpting scenario by Fom b\nis plausible. We used a dedicated MCMC code to derive the statistical\ndistributions of the orbital elements of Fom b. Then we used symplectic N-body\nintegration to investigate the dynamics of the dust belt, as perturbed by a\nsingle planet. Different attempts were made assuming different masses for Fom\nb. We also performed a semi-analytical study to explain our results. Our\nresults are in good agreement with others regarding the orbit of Fom b. We find\nthat the orbit is highly eccentric, is close to apsidally aligned with the\nbelt, and has a moderate mutual inclination relative to the belt plane of. If\ncoplanar, this orbit crosses the disk. Our dynamical study then reveals that\nthe observed planet could sculpt a transient belt configuration with a similar\neccentricity to what is observed, but it would not be simultaneously apsidally\naligned with the planet. This transient configuration only occurs a short time\nafter the planet is placed on such an orbit (assuming an initially circular\ndisk), a time that is inversely proportional to the planet's mass, and that is\nin any case much less than the 440 Myr age of the star. We constrain how long\nthe observed dust belt could have survived with Fom b on its current orbit, as\na function of its possible mass. This analysis leads us to conclude that Fom b\nis likely to have low mass, that it is unlikely to be responsible for the\nsculpting of the belt, and that it supports the hypothesis of a more massive,\nless eccentric planet companion Fom c.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Nov 2013 12:25:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

Its\ncoherence length is about 22 times longer than that of the input laser pulses.\nIt is a classical analogue to the large difference between the one- and\ntwo-photon coherence lengths of entangled photon pairs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Nov 2013 12:30:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-10"}

Our study employs multi-wavelength observations from HMI,\nAIA and ChroTel. Emerging flux formed a neutral line ahead of the leading\nsunspot and new satellite spots. The sunspot splitting caused a long-lasting\nflow toward this neutral line, where a filament formed. Further flux emergence,\npartly of mixed-polarity, as well as episodes of flux cancellation occurred\nrepeatedly at the neutral line. Following a nearby C-class precursor flare with\nsigns of interaction with the filament, the filament erupted nearly\nsimultaneously with the onset of the M5.6 flare and evolved into a coronal mass\nejection. The sunspot stretched without forming a light bridge, splitting\nunusually fast (within about a day, complete approximately 6 hours after the\neruption) in two nearly equal parts. The front part separated strongly from the\nactive region to approach the neighbouring active region where all its coronal\nmagnetic connections were rooted. It also rotated rapidly (by 4.9 degree/hr)\nand caused significant shear flows at its edge. The eruption resulted from a\ncomplex sequence of processes in the (sub-)photosphere and corona. The\npersistent flows toward the neutral line likely caused the formation of a flux\nrope which held the filament. These flows and their associated flux\ncancellation, the emerging flux, and the precursor flare all contributed to the\ndestabilization of the flux rope. We interpret the sunspot splitting as the\nseparation of two flux bundles differently rooted in the convection zone and\nonly temporarily joined in the spot. This explains the rotation as continued\nrise of the separating flux and implies that at least this part of the sunspot\nwas still connected to its roots deep in the convection zone.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Nov 2013 13:50:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Dec 2013 11:15:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

In spite of the diversity of the magnetic\nfield topologies among the stars in our sample, we find that stellar wind\nflowing near the (rotational) equatorial plane carries most of the stellar\nangular momentum, but there is no preferred colatitude contributing to mass\nloss, as the mass flux is maximum at different colatitudes for different stars.\nWe find that more non-axisymmetric magnetic fields result in more asymmetric\nmass fluxes and wind total pressures $p_{\\rm tot}$ (defined as the sum of\nthermal, magnetic and ram pressures).

With employing molecular-beam epitaxy (MBE) and single\ncrystal ZnO substrates, the density of residual impurities and defects can be\ndrastically reduced and the optical and electrical properties have been\ndramatically improved for the ZnO films and heterostructures with MgxZn1-xO.\nHere, we overview such recent technological advancement from various aspects of\napplication. Towards optoelectronic devices such as a light emitter and a\nphotodetector in an ultraviolet region, the development of p-type ZnO and the\nfabrication of excellent Schottky contact, respectively, have been subjected to\nintensive studies for years.

From the viewpoint of\nelectronic devices, two-dimensional electrons confined at the MgxZn1-xO/ZnO\ninterfaces are promising candidate for quantum devices because of high electron\nmobility and strong electron-electron correlation effect.

They also arise naturally when the\nStandard Model is embedded into a more general theory.

J. Appl. Phys. 114 (2013)\n063507, Kempisty et al. ArXiv 1307.5778 (2013)]. Ab initio calculations were\nperformed to study the physical properties of GaN(0001) surface in ammonia-rich\nconditions, i.e. covered by mixture of NH3 molecules and NH2 radicals. The\nFermi level is pinned at valence band maximum (VBM) and conduction band minimum\n(CBM) for full coverage by NH3 molecules and NH2 radicals, respectively. For\nthe crossover content of ammonia of about 25% monolayer (ML), the Fermi level\nis unpinned. It was shown that hydrogen adsorption energy depends on the doping\nin the bulk for the unpinned Fermi level, i.e. for this coverage. Surface\nstructure thermodynamic and mechanical stability criteria are defined and\ncompared. Mechanical stability of the coverage of such surfaces was checked by\ndetermination of the desorption energy of hydrogen molecules. Thermodynamic\nstability analysis indicates that initally equilibrium hydrogen vapor partial\npressure steeply increases with NH3 content to attain the crossover NH3/NH2\ncoverage, i.e. the unpinned Fermi level condition. For such condition the\nentire range of experimentally accessible pressures belongs showing that vapor\ngrowth of semiconductor crystals occurs predominantly for unpinned Fermi level\nat the surface, i.e. for flat bands. Accordingly, adsorption energy of most\nspecies depends on the doping in the bulk that is basis of the possible\nmolecular scenario explaining dependence of the growth and the doping of\nsemiconductor crystals on the doping in the bulk\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Nov 2013 17:36:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-09"}
