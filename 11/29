One century from the discovery of\nthis phenomenon seems to be a good time to stop and think about what we have\nunderstood about Cosmic Rays. The aim of this review is to illustrate the ideas\nthat have been and are being explored in order to account for the observable\nquantities related to cosmic rays and to summarize the numerous new pieces of\nobservation that are becoming available. In fact, despite the possible\nimpression that development in this field is somewhat slow, the rate of new\ndiscoveries in the last decade or so has been impressive, and mainly driven by\nbeautiful pieces of observation. At the same time scientists in this field have\nbeen able to propose new, fascinating ways to investigate particle acceleration\ninside the sources, making use of multifrequency observations that range from\nthe radio, to the optical, to X-rays and gamma rays. These ideas can now be\nconfronted with data. I will mostly focus on supernova remnants as the most\nplausible sources of Galactic cosmic rays, and I will review the main aspects\nof the modern theory of diffusive particle acceleration at supernova remnant\nshocks, with special attention for the dynamical reaction of accelerated\nparticles on the shock and the phenomenon of magnetic field amplification at\nthe shock. Cosmic ray escape from the sources is discussed as a necessary step\nto determine the spectrum of cosmic rays at the Earth. In the end of this\nreview I will also discuss the phenomenon of cosmic ray acceleration at shocks\npropagating in partially ionized media and the implications of this phenomenon\nin terms of width of the Balmer line emission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Nov 2013 16:00:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 9 Dec 2013 11:31:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

A bilinear, time-independent cohesive zone law is implemented\nfor describing fracture behaviour of grain boundaries. Simulation conditions\nare similar to those found at contact between a head and a cup of hip\nprosthesis. Residual stresses arisen from the mismatch of thermal coefficient\nbetween grains are determined. Then, effects of a micro-void and contact stress\nmagnitude are investigated with models containing residual stresses. For the\npurpose of simulating fatigue behaviour, cyclic loadings are applied to the\nmodels. Findings - Results show that crack density is gradually increased with\nincreasing magnitude of contact stress or number of fatigue cycles. It is also\nidentified that a micro-void brings about the increase of crack density rate.\nSocial implications - This paper is the first step for predicting the lifetime\nof ceramic implants. The social implications would appear in the next few years\nabout health issues.

In order to find the BLUE estimator of the unknown parameter, the FC\ncombines spatially distributed, linearly processed, noisy observations of local\nsensors received through orthogonal channels corrupted by fading and additive\nGaussian noise.

It has become clear that above the Maxwell load,\n$P_M$, there are localized solutions offering an order-of-magnitude increase in\nsensitivity to lateral side-loads, whether static or dynamic. We propose to\ncall this 'shock-sensitivity', and notice that so far only the seminal paper by\nHorak, Lord and Peletier in 2006 has quantified this in terms of an $E(P)$\nenergy-barrier versus load graph. In this paper we present three graphs of this\nnature for archetypal problems: the free twisted rod, the cylindrically\nconstrained rod, and the strut on a softening elastic foundation. We find in\nall cases that the energy barrier of the localizing solution above $P_M$ is\nquite close to the energy of a single periodic wave. Now a single such wave is\nnot kinematically admissible, and the corresponding periodic barrier must be\nfor all the waves in the long structure, $N$, say. So in practice $N$ will be\nlarge, and does indeed tend to infinity with the length of the structure. Thus\nthe sensitivity increases by a factor of a large $N$ as the Maxwell load is\nexceeded. This is important in its own right, and we do not seek to explain or\nfit curves to the scattered experimental buckling loads of shell structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Nov 2013 18:03:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Dec 2013 12:39:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

In several such binary systems the masses of the companion\nstars have been derived allowing to distinguish two classes of objects, called\nthe Black Widow and the Redback binaries. Pulsars in these binary systems are\nexpected to produce winds which, colliding with stellar winds, create\nconditions for acceleration of electrons. These electrons should interact with\nthe anisotropic radiation from the companion stars producing gamma-ray emission\nmodulated with the orbital period of the binary system. We consider the\ninteraction of a millisecond pulsar (MSP) wind with a very inhomogeneous\nstellar wind from the companion star within binary systems of the Black Widow\nand Redback types. It is expected that the pulsar wind should mix efficiently\nwith the inhomogeneous stellar wind. Electrons accelerated in such mixed,\nturbulent winds can interact with the magnetic field and also strong radiation\nfrom the companion star producing not only synchrotron radiation but also\ngamma-rays in the the Inverse Compton process. Applying numerical methods, we\ncalculated the GeV-TeV gamma-ray spectra and the light curves expected from\nsome millisecond pulsar binary systems. It is concluded that energetic\nmillisecond pulsar binary systems create a new class of TeV gamma-ray sources\nwhich could be detectable by the future Cherenkov arrays (e.g. CTA) and\npossibly also by the extensive campaigns with the present arrays (HESS, MAGIC,\nVERITAS). However, gamma-ray emission from the millisecond pulsar binary\nsystems is predicted to have different features than those observed in the case\nof massive TeV gamma-ray binaries such as LS I 303 61 or LS 5039.

For a 24-dimensional valence space,\nthe Hartree-Bogolyubov (HB) plus random phase approximation (RPA) to the lowest\neigenvalue of the Hamiltonian is shown to be accurate except near values of the\npairing force coupling constant G where the HB solution shifts from a zero to a\nnon-zero pair gap. In the limit G -> infinity the HB + RPA is asymptotically\nexact. The inaccuracy of the HB + RPA in the critical regions of G can be\nremedied by interpolation. The resulting algoritm is used to calculate pairing\ncorrections in the framework of a Nilsson-Strutinsky calculation of nuclear\nmasses near N = Z for A = 24-100, where N and Z are the numbers of neutrons and\nprotons, and A = N + Z.

To help address this issue through material optimization, here\nwe unravel the mechanisms of charging sub-nanometer pores with ionic liquids\nusing molecular simulations, navigated by a phenomenological model. We show\nthat charging of ionophilic pores is a diffusive process, often accompanied by\noverfilling followed by de-filling. In sharp contrast to conventional\nexpectations, charging is fast because ion diffusion during charging can be an\norder of magnitude faster than in bulk, and charging itself is accelerated by\nthe onset of collective modes. Further acceleration can be achieved using\nionophobic pores by eliminating overfilling/de-filling and thus leading to\ncharging behavior qualitatively different from that in conventional, ionophilic\npores.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Nov 2013 11:44:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

For practical description of the atom-surface\ninteraction potentials the radial dependent $C_3$ coefficients are given for a\nwide range of separation distances between the ground states of the considered\natoms and the wall surfaces and also for different values of nanotube radii.\nThe coefficients for the graphene layer are fit to a logistic function\ndependent on the separation distance. For CNT, we have carried out a paraboloid\nkind of fit dependent on both the separation distances and radii of the CNT.\nThese fitted functions,with the list of fitting parameters, can be used to\nextrapolate the interaction potentials between the considered alkali atoms and\nthe graphene layer or CNT surface conveniently at the given level of accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Nov 2013 12:06:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

To explain the presence of energetic ions, we propose a double layer\n(DL) confining the hot plasma inside a spoke: if an atom becomes ionized inside\nthe spokes region it is accelerated because of the DL to higher energies\nwhereas its energy remains unchanged if it is ionized outside. In applying this\nDL model to our measurements the observed phenomena as well as several\nmeasurements from other groups can be explained.

Given a proper unit\nchoice for pressure $p$, i.e., effective modulus $E^*$ times the\nroot-mean-square gradient $\\bar{g}$, the relative contact area mainly depends\non $p$ but barely on the Hurst exponent $H$ even at large $p$.

At the time of the observation, the\nneutron star was close to apastron, and the source had remained quiet for two\norbital cycles.

The rotation axis goes through the position of a compact far-infrared\nsource detected by Spitzer and Herschel. The specific angular momentum of the\ncore is typical for protostellar envelopes.

The tentative\ncontinuum detection and the indications of a warm background component near the\nrotation axis suggest that the core contains a deeply embedded outflow which\nmay have been missed in previous single-dish CO surveys owing to beam dilution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Nov 2013 14:26:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-26"}

This is especially the case for SS433, an\nX-ray binary from which a precessing jet is observed down to the sub-parsec\nscale.\n  Aims. We want to study full 3D dynamics of relativistic jets associated with\nAGN or XRB. We study the precessing motion of a jet as a model for the jet\nassociated with the XRB SS433. Our study of the jet dynamics in this system\nfocuses on the sub-parsec scales. We investigate the impact of jet precession\nand the variation of the Lorentz factor of the injected matter on the general\n3D jet dynamics and its energy transfer to the surrounding medium. We realize\nsynthetic radio mapping of the data, to compare our results with observations.\n  Methods. For our study we use the code MPI-AMRVAC with SRHD model of a\nbaryonic jet. We use a AMR scheme and an inner time-dependent boundary\nprescription to inject the jets. Parameters extracted from observations were\nused. 3D jet realizations that match the SS433 jet are intercompared. We track\nthe energy content, as deposited in different regions of the domain affected by\nthe jet. Our code also follows a population of particles injected with the jet.\nThis evolving energy spectrum of accelerated electrons, allows to obtain the\nradio emission from our simulation.\n  Results. we obtain meaningful observations. We find increased energy transfer\nfor a precessing jet compared to a standing jets. We obtain synthetic radio\nmaps for all jets.\n  Conclusions. The synthetic radio map matches best for a model using the\ncanonical kinematic model. Overdense precessing jets experience significant\ndeceleration in their propagation through the ISM, and while the overall jet is\nof helical shape. This argument show that the kinematic model for SS433\nassuming ballistic propagation has to be corrected for this decelretaion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Nov 2013 15:13:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 2 Dec 2013 14:46:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

The main advantage of this test\nis that it does not depend on the evolution of the galaxies, but only on the\ngeometry of the universe. However, the redshift distortions produced by the\npeculiar velocities of the gravitational infall do also have an influence,\nwhich should be separated from the cosmological effect. We derive the\nanisotropic correlation function of sources in three surveys within the Sloan\nDigital Sky Survey (SDSS): galaxies from SDSS-III/Baryon Oscillation\nSpectroscopy Survey-Data Release 10 (BOSS-DR10), and QSOs from SDSS-II and\nSDSS-III/BOSS-DR10. From these, we are able to disentangle the dynamic and\ngeometric distortions and thus derive the ratio of observed angular size to\nradial/redshift size at different redshifts. We also add some other values\navailable in the literature. Then, we use the data to evaluate which\ncosmological model fits them. We used six different models: concordance\nLambda-CDM, Einstein-de Sitter, open-Friedman Cosmology without dark energy,\nflat quasi-steady state cosmology, a static universe with a linear Hubble law,\nand a static universe with tired-light redshift. Only two of the six models\nabove fit the data of the Alcock & Paczynski test: concordance Lambda-CDM and\nstatic universe with tired-light redshift; whereas the rest of them are\nexcluded at a >95% confidence level.

A wave\ntrain, hence an energy quantum, can only be emitted by its source gradually. In\nboth the two processes the wave and \"particle\" attributes of the radiation\nfield are simultaneously prominent, where an overall satisfactory theory has\nbeen lacking. This paper presents a first principles treatment, in a unified\nframework of the classical and quantum mechanics, of the latter process, the\nemission of a single radiation quantum based on the dynamics of the\nradiation-emitting source, a charged oscillator which is itself extensive\nacross its confining potential well. During the emission of one single\nradiation quantum, the extensive charged oscillator undergoes a continuous\nradiation damping and is non-stationary. This process is in this work treated\nusing a quasi stationary approach, whereby the classical equation of motion,\nwhich directly facilitates the correspondence principle for a particle\noscillator, and the quantum wave equation are established for each sufficiently\nbrief time interval. As an inevitable consequence of the division of the total\ntime for emitting one single quantum, a fractional Planck constant $h$ is\nintroduced. The solutions to the two simultaneous equations yield for the\ncharged oscillator a continuously exponentially decaying Hamiltonian that is at\nthe same time quantised with respect to the fractional-$h$ at any instant of\ntime; and the radiation wave field emitted over time stretches a wave train of\nfinite length. The total system of the source and radiation field maintains at\nany time (integer $n$ times) one whole energy quantum, $h \\times$ frequency, in\ncomplete accordance with the notion of quantum mechanics and experiment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Nov 2013 09:32:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

The topology of a power grid, together with its operative\nstate determine, for the most part, the robustness of the power grid against\ncascading failures. Secure electrical power supply requires, together with\ncareful operation, a robust design of the electrical power grid topology. This\npaper investigates the impact of a power grid topology on its robustness\nagainst cascading failures. Currently, the impact of the topology on a grid\nrobustness is mainly assessed by using purely topological approaches that fail\nto capture the essence of electric power flow. This paper proposes a metric,\nthe effective graph resistance, that relates the topology of a power grid to\nits robustness against cascading failures by deliberate attacks, while also\ntaking the fundamental characteristics of the electric power grid into account\nsuch as power flow allocation according to Kirchoff Laws. Experimental\nverification shows that the proposed metric anticipates the grid robustness\naccurately. The proposed metric is used to optimize a grid topology for a\nhigher level of robustness.
