It is known that the nonlinear optimal control problem relies on\nthe solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation, which is a\nnonlinear partial differential equation that is generally impossible to be\nsolved analytically. Even worse, most of practical systems are too complicated\nto establish their accurate mathematical model. To overcome these difficulties,\nwe propose a data-based approximate policy iteration (API) method by using real\nsystem data rather than system model. Firstly, a model-free policy iteration\nalgorithm is derived for constrained optimal control problem and its\nconvergence is proved, which can learn the solution of HJB equation and optimal\ncontrol policy without requiring any knowledge of system mathematical model.\nThe implementation of the algorithm is based on the thought of actor-critic\nstructure, where actor and critic neural networks (NNs) are employed to\napproximate the control policy and cost function, respectively. To update the\nweights of actor and critic NNs, a least-square approach is developed based on\nthe method of weighted residuals. The whole data-based API method includes two\nparts, where the first part is implemented online to collect real system\ninformation, and the second part is conducting offline policy iteration to\nlearn the solution of HJB equation and the control policy. Then, the data-based\nAPI algorithm is simplified for solving unconstrained optimal control problem\nof nonlinear and linear systems. Finally, we test the efficiency of the\ndata-based API control design method on a simple nonlinear system, and further\napply it to a rotational/translational actuator system.

Given an abstract functional calculus (E, F, Phi)\non a Banach space X, where F (O) is an algebra of scalar-valued functions on a\nset O, we define a square function Phi_gamma(f) for certain H-valued functions\nf on O. The assignment f to Phi_gamma(f) then becomes a vectorial functional\ncalculus, and a \"square function estimate\" for f simply means the boundedness\nof Phi_gamma(f). In this view, all results linking square function estimates\nwith the boundedness of a certain (usually the H-infinity) functional calculus\nsimply assert that certain square function estimates imply other square\nfunction estimates. In the present paper several results of this type are\nproved in an abstract setting, based on the principles of subordination,\nintegral representation, and a new boundedness concept for subsets of Hilbert\nspaces, the so-called ell-1 -frame-boundedness. These abstract results are then\napplied to the H-infinity calculus for sectorial and strip type operators.

The reward of the complex action is some\nfunction of the basic arms' rewards, and the feedback observed may not\nnecessarily be the reward per-arm. For instance, when the complex actions are\nsubsets of the arms, we may only observe the maximum reward over the chosen\nsubset. Thus, feedback across complex actions may be coupled due to the nature\nof the reward function. We prove a frequentist regret bound for Thompson\nsampling in a very general setting involving parameter, action and observation\nspaces and a likelihood function over them. The bound holds for\ndiscretely-supported priors over the parameter space and without additional\nstructural properties such as closed-form posteriors, conjugate prior structure\nor independence across arms. The regret bound scales logarithmically with time\nbut, more importantly, with an improved constant that non-trivially captures\nthe coupling across complex actions due to the structure of the rewards. As\napplications, we derive improved regret bounds for classes of complex bandit\nproblems involving selecting subsets of arms, including the first nontrivial\nregret bounds for nonlinear MAX reward feedback from subsets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Nov 2013 13:51:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-05"}

For France,\nseveral relationships were estimated eight years ago. The change rate of labour\nforce was used as a driving force of inflation and unemployment within the\nPhillips curve framework. The set of nested models starts with a simplistic\nversion without autoregressive terms and one lagged term of explanatory\nvariable. The lag is determined empirically together with all coefficients. The\nmodel is estimated using the Boundary Element Method (BEM) with the least\nsquares method applied to the integral solutions of the differential equations.\nAll models include one structural break might be associated with revisions to\ndefinitions and measurement procedures in the 1980s and 1990s as well as with\nthe change in monetary policy in 1994-1995. For the GDP deflator, our original\nmodel provided a root mean squared forecast error (RMSFE) of 1.0% per year at a\nfour-year horizon for the period between 1971 and 2004. The rate of CPI\ninflation is predicted with RMSFE=1.5% per year. For the naive (no change)\nforecast, RMSFE at the same time horizon is 2.95% and 3.3% per year,\nrespectively. Our model outperforms the naive one by a factor of 2 to 3. The\nrelationships for inflation were successfully tested for cointegration. We have\nformally estimated several vector error correction (VEC) models for two\nmeasures of inflation. At a four year horizon, the estimated VECMs provide\nsignificant statistical improvements on the results obtained by the BEM:\nRMSFE=0.8% per year for the GDP deflator and ~1.2% per year for CPI. For a two\nyear horizon, the VECMs improve RMSFEs by a factor of 2, with the smallest\nRMSFE=0.5% per year for the GDP deflator.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Nov 2013 08:22:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-06"}

At present we\nlack the common understanding of the processes of life and cognition in living\norganisms with the details of co-construction of informational structures and\ncomputational processes in embodied, embedded cognizing agents, both living and\nartifactual ones. Starting with the definition of an agent as an entity capable\nof acting on its own behalf, as an actor in Hewitt Actor model of computation,\neven so simple systems as molecules can be modelled as actors exchanging\nmessages (information). We adopt Kauffmans view of a living agent as something\nthat can reproduce and undergoes at least one thermodynamic work cycle. This\ndefinition of living agents leads to the Maturana and Varelas identification of\nlife with cognition. Within the info-computational constructive approach to\nliving beings as cognizing agents, from the simplest to the most complex living\nsystems, mechanisms of cognition can be studied in order to construct synthetic\nmodel classes of artifactual cognizing agents on different levels of\norganization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Nov 2013 21:43:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-21"}
