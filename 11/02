Consequently, metrics of universal spacetimes solve vacuum\nequations of all gravitational theories with Lagrangian being a polynomial\ncurvature invariant constructed from the metric, the Riemann tensor and its\nderivatives of arbitrary order. In the literature, universal metrics are also\ndiscussed as metrics with vanishing quantum corrections and as classical\nsolutions to string theory. Widely known examples of universal metrics are\ncertain Ricci-flat pp waves.\n  In this paper, we start a general study of geometric properties of universal\nmetrics in arbitrary dimension and we arrive at a broader class of such\nmetrics. In contrast with pp waves, these universal metrics also admit\nnon-vanishing cosmological constant and in general do not have to possess a\ncovariantly constant or recurrent null vector field. First, we show that a\nuniversal spacetime is necessarily a CSI spacetime, i.e. all curvature\ninvariants constructed from the Riemann tensor and its derivatives are\nconstant. Then we focus on type N spacetimes, where we arrive at a simple\nnecessary and sufficient condition: a type N spacetime is universal if and only\nif it is an Einstein Kundt spacetime. A class of type III Kundt universal\nmetrics is also found. Several explicit examples of universal metrics are\npresented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Nov 2013 17:36:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 30 Aug 2014 10:04:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-17"}

Coordination usually requires sufficient information\nflow, which is usually depicted by the connectivity of the communication\nnetwork. In a networked system, removal of some agents may cause a\ndisconnection. In order to maintain connectivity in agent removal, one can\ndesign a robust network topology that tolerates a finite number of agent\nlosses, and/or develop a control strategy that recovers connectivity. This\npaper proposes a decentralized control scheme based on a sequence of\nreplacements, each of which occurs between an agent and one of its immediate\nneighbors. The replacements always end with an agent, whose relocation does not\ncause a disconnection. We show that such an agent can be reached by a local\nrule utilizing only some local information available in agents' immediate\nneighborhoods. As such, the proposed message passing strategy guarantees the\nconnectivity maintenance in arbitrary agent removal.

This leads to a continuous 'cyber cycle' of\nattackers scanning networks, developing exploits and attacking systems, with\ndefenders detecting attacks, analyzing exploits and patching systems. This\nreactive nature leaves sensitive systems highly vulnerable to attack due to\nun-patched systems and undetected exploits. Some current research attempts to\naddress this major limitation by introducing systems that implement moving\ntarget defense. However, these ideas are typically based on the intuition that\na moving target defense will make it much harder for attackers to find and scan\nvulnerable systems, and not on theoretical mathematical foundations. The\ncontinuing lack of fundamental science and principles for developing more\nsecure systems has drawn increased interest into establishing a 'science of\ncyber security'. This paper introduces the concept of using cybernetics, an\ninterdisciplinary approach of control theory, systems theory, information\ntheory and game theory applied to regulatory systems, as a foundational\napproach for developing cyber security principles. It explores potential\napplications of cybernetics to cyber security from a defensive perspective,\nwhile suggesting the potential use for offensive applications. Additionally,\nthis paper introduces the fundamental principles for building non-stationary\nsystems, which is a more general solution than moving target defenses.

It provides information on the horizontal\nflow field and thermodynamic structure in the layers immediately below the\nphotosphere.

However, in contrast to what occurs at inner horizons of black holes,\nwe show that the blueshift is uniformly bounded along incoming and outgoing\nnull rays. Motivated by this boundedness result, we take a step beyond the\ngeometric optic approximation and consider the Cauchy evolution of spherically\nsymmetric test scalar fields. We prove that under reasonable conditions on the\ninitial data a suitable rescaled field can be continuously extended to the\nCauchy horizon. In particular, this result implies that the physical field is\neverywhere finite on the Cauchy horizon away from the central singularity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Nov 2013 19:30:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-17"}

Very recently, a line of work\n\\cite{javanmard2013hypothesis, confidenceJM, GBR-hypothesis} has addressed this\nproblem by constructing a debiased version of the Lasso estimator. In this\npaper, we study this approach for random design model, under the assumption\nthat a good estimator exists for the precision matrix of the design. Our\nanalysis improves over the state of the art in that it establishes nearly\noptimal \\emph{average} testing power if the sample size $n$ asymptotically\ndominates $s_0 (\\log p)^2$, with $s_0$ being the sparsity level (number of\nnon-zero coefficients). Earlier work obtains provable guarantees only for much\nlarger sample size, namely it requires $n$ to asymptotically dominate $(s_0\n\\log p)^2$.\n  In particular, for random designs with a sparse precision matrix we show that\nan estimator thereof having the required properties can be computed\nefficiently. Finally, we evaluate this approach on synthetic data and compare\nit with earlier proposals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Nov 2013 19:41:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-04"}

We here assess the\ndanger of exomoons to be in a runaway greenhouse (RG) state due to extensive\nheating from the planet.

The total energy budget of stellar flux, illumination from the planet,\nand tidal heating in the satellite is compared to the critical flux for the\nmoon to experience an RG effect. Irradiation from a 13-Jupiter-mass planet onto\nan Earth-sized moon at a distance of ten Jupiter radii can drive an RG state on\nthe moon for about 200 Myr. If stellar illumination equivalent to that received\nby Earth from the Sun is added, the RG holds for about 500 Myr. After 1000 Myr,\nthe planet's habitable edge has moved inward to about 6 planetary radii.\nExomoons in orbits with eccentricities of 0.1 experience strong tidal heating;\nthey must orbit a 13-Jupiter-mass host beyond 29 or 18 Jupiter radii after 100\nMyr (at the inner and outer boundaries of the stellar HZ, respectively), and\nbeyond 13 Jupiter radii (in both cases) after 1000 Myr to be habitable. If a\nroughly Earth-sized moon would be detected in orbit around a giant planet, and\nif this binary would orbit in the stellar HZ, then it will be crucial to\nrecover the moon's orbital history. If such a moon around a 13-Jupiter-mass\nplanet has been closer than 20 Jupiter radii to its host during the first few\nhundred million years at least, then it might have lost substantial amounts of\nits initial water reservoir and be uninhabitable today.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Nov 2013 20:13:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

In this\npaper we present alternative unifying topological spaces, that we call\napproximation spaces. They are exactly the spaces for which player Nonempty has\na stationary strategy in the Choquet game. A natural proper subclass of\napproximation spaces coincides with the class of quasi-Polish spaces. We study\nthe Borel and Hausdorff difference hierarchies in approximation spaces,\nrevisiting the work done for the other topological spaces. We also consider the\nproblem of effectivization of these results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Nov 2013 02:44:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-20"}

These results explain the mechanism by which\npropagating and stationary droplets can be stabilized in a confined\nferromagnet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Nov 2013 06:34:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 2 Apr 2014 15:04:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 25 Apr 2014 16:31:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-18"}

An excellent\nintroduction to the topic of rough matroids is due to Zhu and Wang. On the\nbasis of their work, we study the rough matroids based on coverings in this\npaper. First, we investigate some properties of the definable sets with respect\nto a covering. Specifically, it is interesting that the set of all definable\nsets with respect to a covering, equipped with the binary relation of inclusion\n$\\subseteq$, constructs a lattice. Second, we propose the rough matroids based\non coverings, which are a generalization of the rough matroids based on\nrelations. Finally, some properties of rough matroids based on coverings are\nexplored. Moreover, an equivalent formulation of rough matroids based on\ncoverings is presented.

We\ndemonstrate that in the ballistic regime the presence of a small region with a\nnon-collinear magnetization near the center of a ferromagnetic weak link\nrestores the critical current inherent to the normal metal. The above effect\ncan be stimulated by additional electrical bias of the magnetic gate which\ninduces a local electron depletion of ferromagnetic barrier. The underlying\nphysics of the effect is the interference phenomena due to the magnetic\nscattering of the Cooper pair, which reverses its total momentum in the\nferromagnet and thus compensates the phase gain before and after the\nspin-reversed scattering. In contrast with the widely discussed triplet long\nranged proximity effect we elucidate a new singlet long ranged proximity\neffect. This phenomenon opens a way to easily control the properties of SFS\njunctions and inversely to manipulate the magnetic moment via the Josephson\ncurrent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Nov 2013 12:06:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 Jun 2014 09:12:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-30"}

However, despite decades of research and industrial\napplication, the real time behavior of particle flow fields is still not well\nunderstood. One of the main reasons is that experimental data is difficult to\nacquire in such harsh, opaque particle flow environments. In this educational\nvideo for the Gallery of Fluid Motion, high speed video acquired with a new,\npatented high speed particle imaging velocimetry (high speed PIV) technology is\npresented. This technology was developed by the USDOE National Energy\nTechnology Laboratory (NETL). It is being applied to observe and measure the\nreal time behavior of individual particle motion inside particle flow fields of\nhigh particle concentration for the first time. The high speed PIV system\nrecords high speed videos of particle motion with excellent spatial and\ntemporal clarity. The high speed videos are analyzed to measure the\nconcentration and the two-dimensional motion (velocity and trajectory) of\nindividual particles. Data sample rates for velocity vectors are in the range\nof 0.1 to 3 million vectors per second, thereby providing full resolution of\nthe temporal domain of particle velocity. To see and measure particle motion\ninside the flow fields at high particle concentrations, a custom borescope is\ninserted into particle flow fields.\n  The particle tracking technique can measure gas and fluid flow if the\nparticles are small enough (have a low enough Stokes number) to follow the\ngas/fluid flow. In areas of rapid mixing, such as turbulent wakes, particle\ntracking can provide better spatial resolution that conventional\ncross-correlation based PIV analysis.\n  Keywords: fluid dynamics video, particle tracking, fluidization\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Nov 2013 17:34:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-06"}

Recent research works have intensively\nstudied distributed optimization problems in the case where the nodes have to\nestimate a single optimum parameter vector collaboratively. However, there are\nmany important applications that are multitask-oriented in the sense that there\nare multiple optimum parameter vectors to be inferred simultaneously, in a\ncollaborative manner, over the area covered by the network. In this paper, we\nemploy diffusion strategies to develop distributed algorithms that address\nmultitask problems by minimizing an appropriate mean-square error criterion\nwith $\\ell_2$-regularization. The stability and convergence of the algorithm in\nthe mean and in the mean-square sense is analyzed.
