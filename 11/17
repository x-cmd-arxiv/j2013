A\nrecent theory of invariant recognition by feedforward hierarchical networks,\nlike HMAX, other convolutional networks, or possibly the ventral stream,\nimplies an alternative approach to unconstrained face recognition. This\napproach accomplishes detection and alignment implicitly by storing\ntransformations of training images (called templates) rather than explicitly\ndetecting and aligning faces at test time. Here we propose a particular\nlocality-sensitive hashing based voting scheme which we call \"consensus of\ncollisions\" and show that it can be used to approximate the full 3-layer\nhierarchy implied by the theory.

The\ncoronal heating and solar wind acceleration are addressed with low-frequency\nAlfven wave turbulence. The injection of Alfven wave energy at the inner\nboundary is such that the Poynting flux is proportional to the magnetic field\nstrength. The three-dimensional magnetic field topology is simulated using data\nfrom photospheric magnetic field measurements. This model does not impose\nopen-closed magnetic field boundaries; those develop self-consistently. The\nphysics includes: (1) The model employs three different temperatures, namely\nthe isotropic electron temperature and the parallel and perpendicular ion\ntemperatures. The firehose, mirror, and ion-cyclotron instabilities due to the\ndeveloping ion temperature anisotropy are accounted for. (2) The Alfven waves\nare partially reflected by the Alfven speed gradient and the vorticity along\nthe field lines. The resulting counter-propagating waves are responsible for\nthe nonlinear turbulent cascade. The balanced turbulence due to uncorrelated\nwaves near the apex of the closed field lines and the resulting elevated\ntemperatures are addressed. (3) To apportion the wave dissipation to the three\ntemperatures, we employ the results of the theories of linear wave damping and\nnonlinear stochastic heating. (4) We have incorporated the collisional and\ncollisionless electron heat conduction. We compare the simulated\nmulti-wavelength EUV images of CR2107 with the observations from STEREO/EUVI\nand SDO/AIA instruments. We demonstrate that the reflection due to strong\nmagnetic fields in proximity of active regions intensifies the dissipation and\nobservable emission sufficiently.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Nov 2013 20:51:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Nov 2013 02:44:02 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 3 Dec 2013 04:39:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

The transmitter performs energy beamforming by using\nan instantaneous channel state information (CSI). The CSI is estimated at the\nreceiver by training via a preamble, and fed back to the transmitter. The\nchannel estimate is more accurate when longer preamble is used, but less time\nis left for wireless power transfer before the channel changes. To maximize the\nharvested energy, in this paper, we address the key challenge of balancing the\ntime resource used for channel estimation and wireless power transfer (WPT),\nand also investigate the allocation of energy resource used for wireless power\ntransfer. First, we consider the general scenario where the preamble length is\nallowed to vary dynamically. Taking into account the effects of imperfect CSI,\nthe optimal preamble length is obtained online by solving a dynamic programming\n(DP) problem. The solution is shown to be a threshold-type policy that depends\nonly on the channel estimate power. Next, we consider the scenario in which the\npreamble length is fixed. The optimal preamble length is optimized offline.\nFurthermore, we derive the optimal power allocation schemes for both scenarios.\nFor the scenario of dynamic-length preamble, the power is allocated according\nto both the optimal preamble length and the channel estimate power; while for\nthe scenario of fixed-length preamble, the power is allocated according to only\nthe channel estimate power. The analysis results are validated by numerical\nsimulations. Encouragingly, with optimal power allocation, the harvested energy\nby using optimized fixed-length preamble is almost the same as the harvested\nenergy by employing dynamic-length preamble, hence allowing a low-complexity\nWPT system to be implemented in practice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Nov 2013 02:46:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

In our scheme a qubit interacts with a\nclassical stochastic field describing environmental noise and is then measured\nafter a given interaction time in order to estimate the characteristic\nparameters of the noise. In particular, we address estimation of the spectral\nparameters of two relevant kinds of non-Gaussian noise: random telegraph noise\nwith Lorentzian spectrum and colored noise with $1/f^{\\alpha}$ spectrum. We\ndiscuss the estimation precision achievable by quantum probes by analyzing in\ndetails the behavior of the quantum Fisher information (QFI) as a function of\nthe noise and the other parameters. We found that population measurement on the\nqubit is optimal for noise estimation and also evaluate the optimal interaction\ntimes for the quantum probe, i.e. the values maximizing the QFI and the quantum\nsignal-to-noise ratio. For random telegraph noise the QFI is inversely\nproportional to the square of the switching rate, meaning that the quantum\nsignal-to-noise ratio is constant and thus the switching rate may be uniformly\nestimated with the same precision in its whole range of variation. For colored\nnoise, the precision achievable in the estimation of ``color'', i.e. of the\nexponent $\\alpha$, strongly depends on the structure of the environment, i.e.\non the number of fluctuators describing the classical environment. For an\nenvironment modeled by a single random fluctuator estimation is more precise\nfor pink noise, i.e. for $\\alpha=1$, whereas by increasing the number of\nfluctuators, the QFI is has two local maxima, with the largest one drifting\ntowards $\\alpha=2$, i.e. brown noise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Nov 2013 09:34:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-21"}

At the same time, this distribution is bimodal,\nas the number of objects with d_ring= (0.4-0.7)*d_disk is negligible.

The next\nphase is likely to focus on algorithms capable of learning from very few\nlabeled examples ($n \\to 1$), like humans seem able to do.

The\nstarting point is the conjecture, proved in specific cases, that image\nrepresentations which are invariant to translations, scaling and other\ntransformations can considerably reduce the sample complexity of learning. We\nprove that an invariant and unique (discriminative) signature can be computed\nfor each image patch, $I$, in terms of empirical distributions of the\ndot-products between $I$ and a set of templates stored during unsupervised\nlearning. A module performing filtering and pooling, like the simple and\ncomplex cells described by Hubel and Wiesel, can compute such estimates.\nHierarchical architectures consisting of this basic Hubel-Wiesel moduli inherit\nits properties of invariance, stability, and discriminability while capturing\nthe compositional organization of the visual world in terms of wholes and\nparts. The theory extends existing deep learning convolutional architectures\nfor image and speech recognition. It also suggests that the main computational\ngoal of the ventral stream of visual cortex is to provide a hierarchical\nrepresentation of new objects/images which is invariant to transformations,\nstable, and discriminative for recognition---and that this representation may\nbe continuously learned in an unsupervised way during development and visual\nexperience.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Nov 2013 13:22:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 Nov 2013 10:41:41 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 18 Dec 2013 20:57:24 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 12 Jan 2014 04:06:29 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 11 Mar 2014 19:56:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-12"}

In\ngeneral, the variations in the 14-24 and 35-100 keV bands are well correlated,\nsuggesting a common origin of the variability across the BAT energy band.\nHowever, radio quiet AGN display on average 10% larger variations at 14-24 keV\nthan at 35-100 keV and a softer-when-brighter behavior for most of the Seyfert\ngalaxies with detectable spectral variability on month time scale.

It was found through a combination of imaging techniques and\nelectrophysiological measurements that P. polycephalum is able to internalise a\nrange of electrically active nanoparticles, assemble them in vivo and\ndistribute them around the plasmodium. Hybridised plasmodium is able to form\nbiomorphic mineralised networks, both inside the living plasmodium and the\nempty trails left in its wake by taxis, both of which facilitate the\ntransmission of electricity. Hybridisation also alters the bioelectrical\nactivity of the plasmodium and likely influences its information processing\ncapabilities.

The authors and their institutes are\ndeveloping a web-based service, TAPAS (Transmissions of the AtmosPhere for\nAStromomical data). This service, freely available, is developed and maintained\nwithin the atmospheric ETHER data center. TAPAS computes the atmospheric\ntransmission in the line-of-sight to the target indicated by the user. The user\nfiles a request indicating the time, ground location, and either the equatorial\ncoordinates of the target or the Zenith Angle of the line-of sight (LOS). The\nactual atmospheric profile (temperature, pressure, humidity, ozone content) at\nthat time and place is retrieved from the ETHER atmospheric data base (from a\ncombination of ECMWF meteorological field and other informations), and the\natmospheric transmission is computed from LBLRTM software and HITRAN data base\nfor a number of gases: O2, H2O, O3, CO2, and Rayleigh extinction. The first\npurpose of TAPAS output is to allow identification of observed spectral\nfeatures as being from atmospheric or astrophysical origin. The returned\ntransmission may also serve for characterizing the spectrometer in wavelength\nscale and Instrument Line Spectral Function (ILSF) by comparing one observed\nspectrum of an atmospheric feature to the transmission. Finally, the TOA (Top\nOf Atmosphere) spectrum may be obtained either by division of the observed\nspectrum by the computed transmission or other techniques developed on purpose.\nThe obtention of transmissions for individual species allows more\npotentialities and better adjustments to the data. In this paper, we describe\nbriefly the mechanism of computation of the atmospheric transmissions, and we\nshow some results for O2 and H2O atmospheric absorption.
