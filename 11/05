This is performed through two approaches. In one\napproach, by employing the Feynman proof, the existence of a Lorentz-like force\nin the gravitoelectromagnetism is indicated. The appearance of such a force is\nsubjected to the slow motion and the weak field approximations for stationary\nfields. The analogy between this Lorentz-like force and the motion equation of\na test particle in a non-commutative space leads to the mentioned equivalency.\nIn fact, this equivalency is achieved by the comparison of the two motion\nequations. In the other and quietly independent approach, we demonstrate that a\ngravitomagnetic background can be treated as a Dirac constraint. That is, the\ngravitoelectromagnetic field can be regarded as a constrained system from the\nsense of the Dirac theory. Indeed, the application of the Dirac formalism for\nthe gravitoelectromagnetic field reveals that the phase space coordinates have\nnon-commutative structure from the view of the Dirac bracket.

Whereas abstract\ninterpretation techniques typically over-approximate the set of reachable\nstates iteratively, abstract acceleration captures the effect of the loop with\na single, non-iterative transfer function applied to the initial states at the\nloop head. In contrast to previous acceleration techniques, our approach\napplies to any linear loop without restrictions. Its novelty lies in the use of\nthe Jordan normal form decomposition of the loop body to derive symbolic\nexpressions for the entries of the matrix modeling the effect of n>=0\niterations of the loop. The entries of such a matrix depend on $n$ through\ncomplex polynomial, exponential and trigonometric functions. Therefore, we\nintroduces an abstract domain for matrices that captures the linear inequality\nrelations between these complex expressions. This results in an abstract matrix\nfor describing the fixpoint semantics of the loop.\n  Our approach integrates smoothly into standard abstract interpreters and can\nhandle programs with nested loops and loops containing conditional branches. We\nevaluate it over small but complex loops that are commonly found in control\nsoftware, comparing it with other tools for computing linear loop invariants.\nThe loops in our benchmarks typically exhibit polynomial, exponential and\noscillatory behaviors that present challenges to existing approaches.

In particular, the methanol maser appears as an ideal tool to\nstudy the early phases of massive star formation. However, it is difficult to\nestablish the exact start of the methanol maser phase, and it would then be\ninteresting to detect and study low-flux density methanol masers (i.e., < 0.1\nJy or even << 0.1 Jy), in order to determine if they can effectively be used to\nmark a specific evolutionary phase in high-mass star formation. Past surveys\nhave been unable to systematically detect many low-flux density methanol\nmasers, and thus we do not yet know how many such masers exist in the Galaxy\nand what is their physical nature. Out of a sample of 107 observed Hi-GAL\nsources we detected a total of 32 methanol masers, with 22 sources being new\nand weak (median peak flux density 0.07 Jy) detections, in the Galactic\nlongitude range [32.0, 59.8]deg. We also detected 12 6.035-GHz OH maser, with 9\nobjects being new detections. Our survey covers a similar range of source\ndistances as the \"Arecibo Methanol Maser Galactic Plane Survey\", but the\nmethanol masers detected by us are clearly shifted towards lower integrated\nflux densities. The newly detected methanol masers are mostly of low-luminosity\nand, except for some sources, their weakness is not due to distance effects or\npositional offsets. No specific correlation is found with the physical\nparameters of the Hi-GAL clumps, except for sources with both CH3OH and OH\nmasers which tend to have higher mass and luminosity. The intensity of the\nmethanol masers correlates well with the velocity range of the maser emission,\nwhich suggests that the low brightness of these masers is related to the number\nof maser spots in the emitting region and their evolution with time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Nov 2013 17:07:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-04"}

The\ndynamics of these condensations falling in the solar corona is investigated in\nthis paper using a simple fully ionised plasma model. We find that the presence\nof a heavy condensation gives rise to a dynamical rearrangement of the coronal\npressure that results in the formation of a large pressure gradient that\nopposes gravity. Eventually this pressure gradient becomes so large that the\nblob acceleration vanishes or even points upwards. Then, the blob descent is\ncharacterised by an initial acceleration phase followed by an essentially\nconstant velocity phase. These two stages can be identified in published\ntime-distance diagrams of coronal rain events. Both the duration of the first\nstage and the velocity attained by the blob increase for larger values of the\nratio of blob to coronal density, for larger blob mass, and for smaller coronal\ntemperature. Dense blobs are characterised by a detectable density growth (up\nto 60% in our calculations) and by a steepening of the density in their lower\npart, that could lead to the formation of a shock. They also emit sound waves\nthat could be detected as small intensity changes with periods of the order of\n100 s and lasting between a few and about ten periods. Finally, the curvature\nof the falling path is only relevant when a very dense blob falls along\ninclined magnetic field lines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Nov 2013 17:29:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-03"}

The studies are carried\nout in the context of Kitaev's honeycomb model, where we consider three\ndistinct types of perturbations in the presence of a lattice of Majorana mode\nbinding vortices -- spatial anisotropy of the vortices, dimerization of the\nvortex lattice and local random disorder. While all the nucleated phases are\nstable with respect to weak perturbations of each kind, strong perturbations\nare found to result in very different behavior. Anisotropy of the vortices\nstabilizes the strong-pairing like phases, while dimerization can recover the\nunderlying non-Abelian phase. Local random disorder, on the other hand, can\ndrive all the nucleated phases into a gapless thermal metal state. We show that\nall these distinct behavior can be captured by an effective staggered\ntight-binding model for the Majorana modes. By studying the pairwise\ninteractions between the vortices, i.e. the amplitudes for the Majorana modes\nto tunnel between vortex cores, the locations of phase transitions and the\nnature of the resulting states can be predicted.

Due\nto the presence of non-trivial sampling error, standard techniques for\nestimating discretization error (such as Richardson extrapolation) fail or are\nunreliable. This work provides a systematic and unified approach for estimating\nthese errors. First, a sampling error estimator that accounts for correlation\nin the input data is developed. Then, this sampling error estimate is used as\npart of a Bayesian extension of Richardson extrapolation in order to\ncharacterize the discretization error. These methods are tested using the\nLorenz equations and are shown to perform well. These techniques are then used\nto investigate the sampling and discretization errors in the DNS of a\nwall-bounded turbulent flow. For both cases, it is found that while the\nsampling uncertainty is large enough to make the order of accuracy difficult to\ndetermine, the estimated discretization errors are quite small. This indicates\nthat the commonly used heuristics provide ad- equate resolution for this class\nof problems.

Bayesian optimality\ncriteria provide an attractive solution to this problem. These criteria depend\nsensitively on a reasonable specification of a prior distribution for the model\nparameters which might not be available in all applications. In this paper we\ninvestigate Bayesian optimality criteria with non-informative prior dis-\ntributions. In particular, we study the Jeffreys and the Berger-Bernardo prior\nfor which the corresponding optimality criteria are not necessarily concave.\nSeveral examples are investigated where optimal designs with respect to the new\ncriteria are calculated and compared to Bayesian optimal designs based on a\nuniform and a functional uniform prior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Nov 2013 20:20:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-05"}

The\nspecific version we will use due to Stoffers and Zahed, is based on a\nsemiclassical quantization of a \"tube\" (closed string exchange or open string\nvirtual pair production) in its Euclidean formulation using the scalar Polyakov\naction. This model has a number of phenomenologically successful results. The\nperiodicity of a coordinate around the tube allows the introduction of a\nMatsubara time and therefore an effective temperature Teff on the string. We\nobserve that at the LHC energies and for sufficiently small impact parameter,\nTeff approaches and even exceeds the Hagedorn temperature of the QCD strings.\nBased on studies of the stringy thermodynamics of pure gauge theories we\nsuggest that there should exist two new regimes of the Pomeron: the\n\"near-critical\" and the \"post-critical\" ones. In the former one, string\nexcitations create a high entropy \"string ball\", with high energy and entropy\nbut small pressure/free energy. If heavy enough this ball becomes a (dual)\nblack hole (BH). As the intrinsic temperature of the string exceeds the\nHagedorn temperature, the ball becomes a post-critical explosive \"QGP ball\".\nThe hydrodynamical explosion resulting from this scenario was predicted by us\nto have radial flow exceeding that ever seen even in heavy ion collisions,\nwhich was recently confirmed by CMS and ALICE at LHC.

The aims of this study are to refine the photometric-based\nAMIGA sample of isolated galaxies and to provide an improvement of the\nquantification of the isolation degree with respect to previous works, using\nboth photometry and spectroscopy. We developed an automatic method to search\nfor neighbours within a projected area of 1 Mpc radius centred on each primary\ngalaxy to revise the CIG isolation criteria. Of the 636 CIG galaxies considered\nin the photometric study, 426 galaxies fulfil the CIG isolation criteria within\n1 Mpc, taking into account projected neighbours. Of the 411 CIG galaxies\nconsidered in the spectroscopic study, 347 galaxies fulfil the CIG isolation\ncriteria when a criterion about redshift difference is added. The available\nredshifts allow us to reject background neighbours and thus improve the\nphotometric assessment. For the first time, the environment and the isolation\ndegree of AMIGA galaxies are quantified using digital data. The use of the SDSS\ndatabase permits one to identify fainter and smaller-size satellites than in\nprevious AMIGA works. About 50% of the neighbours considered as potential\ncompanions in the photometric study are in fact background objects. We also\nfind that about 92% of the neighbour galaxies that show recession velocities\nsimilar to the corresponding CIG galaxy are not considered by the CIG isolation\ncriteria as potential companions, which may have a considerable influence on\nthe evolution of the central CIG galaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Nov 2013 20:58:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-05"}

This cluster was previously reported to\nhave a massive starburst (~800 Msun/yr) in the central, brightest cluster\ngalaxy, most likely fueled by the rapidly-cooling intracluster medium. These\nnew data reveal a complex emission-line nebula, extending for >30 kpc from the\ncentral galaxy. The total Halpha luminosity, assuming Halpha/Hbeta = 2.85, is\nL_Ha = 7.6 +/- 0.4 x10^43 erg/s, making this the most luminous emission line\nnebula detected in the center of a cool core cluster. Overall, the relative\nfluxes of the low-ionization lines (e.g., [O II], Hbeta) to the UV continuum\nare consistent with photoionization by young stars. In both the center of the\ngalaxy and in a newly-discovered highly-ionized plume to the north of the\ngalaxy, the ionization ratios are consistent with both shocks and AGN\nphotoionization. We speculate that this extended plume may be a galactic wind,\ndriven and partially photoionized by both the starburst and central AGN. We\nfind evidence for shocks throughout the ISM of the central galaxy, most likely\ndriven by a combination of stellar winds from massive young stars,\ncore-collapse supernovae, and the central AGN. In addition to the warm, ionized\ngas, we detect a substantial amount of cold, molecular gas via the CO(3-2)\ntransition, coincident in position with the galaxy center. We infer a molecular\ngas mass of M_H2 = 2.2 +/- 0.6 x10^10 Msun, which implies that the starburst\nwill consume its fuel in ~30 Myr if it is not replenished.

We measured temperature and density profiles of the hot gas from a\nfraction out to tens of the Bondi radius (R_B = 2.4-4.8 arcsec = 112-224 pc).\nThe projected temperature jumps significantly from ~0.3 keV beyond 5 arcsec to\n~0.7 keV within ~4-5 arcsec, but then abruptly drops back to ~0.3 keV within ~3\narcsec.

This diagnostic plot\nwill provide reliable globular cluster candidates for spectroscopic follow-up\ncampaigns needed to continue the exploration of Virgo's photometric and\nkinematic sub-structures, and will help the design of future searches for\nglobular clusters in extragalactic systems.

MBHBs are expected to be the main\ngravitational wave (GW) sources for pulsar timing arrays (PTAs); however, it is\nstill unclear if the observed GW signal will be produced by a few single MBHBs,\nor if it will have the properties of a stochastic background. The goal of this\nwork is to produce a map of the sky in which each galaxy is assigned a\nprobability of having suffered a recent merger, and of hosting a MBHB that\ncould be detected by PTAs. This constitutes a step forward in the understanding\nof the expected PTA signal: the skymap can be used to investigate the\nclustering properties of PTA sources and the spatial distribution of the\nobservable GW signal power; moreover, galaxies with the highest probabilities\ncould be used as inputs in targeted searches for individual GW sources. We also\ninvestigate the distribution of neighboring galaxies around galaxies hosting\nMBHBs, finding that the most likely detectable PTA sources are located in dense\ngalaxy environments. Different techniques are used in the search, including\nBayesian and Machine Learning algorithms, with consistent outputs.

Pattern dynamics, induced by droughts or\ndisturbances, can result in desertification shifts from patterned vegetation to\nbare soil. Pattern-formation theory suggests various scenarios for such\ndynamics; an abrupt global shift involving a fast collapse to bare soil, a\ngradual global shift involving the expansion and coalescence of bare-soil\ndomains, and an incipient shift to a hybrid state consisting of stationary\nbare-soil domains in an otherwise periodic pattern. Using models of dryland\nvegetation we address the question which of these scenarios can be realized. We\nfound that the models can be split into two groups: models that exhibit\nmultiplicity of periodic-pattern and bare-soil states, and models that exhibit,\nin addition, multiplicity of hybrid states. Furthermore, in all models we could\nnot identify parameter regimes in which bare-soil domains expand into vegetated\ndomains. The significance of these findings is that while models belonging to\nthe first group can only exhibit abrupt shifts, model belonging to the second\ngroup can also exhibit gradual and incipient shifts. A discussion of open\nproblems concludes the paper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Nov 2013 21:08:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-05"}

We show that the half-metallic property of AlN\nribbons can undergo a transition into fully-metallic or semiconducting behavior\nwith application of an electric field or uniaxial strain. An external\ntransverse electric field induces a full charge screening that renders the\nmaterial semiconducting. In contrast, as uniaxial strain varies from\ncompressive to tensile, a spin-resolved selective self-doping increases the\nhalf-metallic character of the ribbons. The relevant strain-induced changes in\nelectronic properties arise from band structure modifications at the Fermi\nlevel as a consequence of a spin-polarized charge transfer between pi-orbitals\nof the N and Al edge atoms in a spin-resolved self-doping process. This band\nstructure tunability indicates the possibility ofdesigning magnetic nanoribbons\nwith tunable electronic structure by deriving edge states from elements with\nsufficiently different localization properties.

In this paper, we propose and\nanalyze a novel divide-and-conquer solver for kernel SVMs (DC-SVM). In the\ndivision step, we partition the kernel SVM problem into smaller subproblems by\nclustering the data, so that each subproblem can be solved independently and\nefficiently. We show theoretically that the support vectors identified by the\nsubproblem solution are likely to be support vectors of the entire kernel SVM\nproblem, provided that the problem is partitioned appropriately by kernel\nclustering. In the conquer step, the local solutions from the subproblems are\nused to initialize a global coordinate descent solver, which converges quickly\nas suggested by our analysis.

An underlying assumption in early work is that\nagents are price-takers, i.e., agents honestly report their true demand in\nresponse to prices. A line of research in economics, initiated by Hurwicz\n(1972), is devoted to understanding how such markets perform when agents are\nstrategic about their demands. This is captured by the \\emph{Walrasian\nMechanism} that proceeds by collecting reported demands, finding clearing\nprices in the \\emph{reported} market via an ascending price t\\^{a}tonnement\nprocedure, and returns the resulting allocation. Similar mechanisms are used,\nfor example, in the daily opening of the New York Stock Exchange and the call\nmarket for copper and gold in London.\n  In practice, it is commonly observed that agents in such markets reduce their\ndemand leading to behaviors resembling bargaining and to inefficient outcomes.\nWe ask how inefficient the equilibria can be. Our main result is that the\nwelfare of every pure Nash equilibrium of the Walrasian mechanism is at least\none quarter of the optimal welfare, when players have gross substitute\nvaluations and do not overbid. Previous analysis of the Walrasian mechanism\nhave resorted to large market assumptions to show convergence to efficiency in\nthe limit.

Therefore, it\nis very necessary to investigate the conditions under which a matroid is\nconnected. In this paper, the connectivity for matroids is studied through\nrelation-based rough sets. First, a symmetric and transitive relation is\nintroduced from a general matroid and its properties are explored from the\nviewpoint of matroids. Moreover, through the relation introduced by a general\nmatroid, an undirected graph is generalized. Specifically, the connection of\nthe graph can be investigated by the relation-based rough sets. Second, we\nstudy the connectivity for matroids by means of relation-based rough sets and\nsome conditions under which a general matroid is connected are presented.\nFinally, it is easy to prove that the connectivity for a general matroid with\nsome special properties and its induced undirected graph is equivalent.

Chief among them is the\ndevelopment of H storage and H-resistant materials. H segregation or trapping\nat lattice defects, including vacancies, dislocations, grain boundaries, etc,\nplays a crucial role in determining the properties of these materials. Here,\nthrough first-principles simulations, we propose a unified mechanism involving\ncharge transfer induced strain destabilization to understand H segregation\nbehavior at vacancies. We discover that H prefers to occupy interstitials with\nhigh pre-existing charge densities and the availability of such interstitials\nsets the limit on H trapping capacity at a vacancy. Once the maximum H capacity\nis reached, the dominant charge donors switch from the nearest-neighbor (NN) to\nthe next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) metal atoms. Accompanying with this long-range\ncharge transfer, a significant reorganization energy would occur, leading to\ninstability of the H-vacancy complex. The physical picture unveiled here\nappears universal across the BCC series and is believed to be relevant to other\nmetals/defects as well. The insight gained from this study is expected to have\nimportant implications for the design of H storage and H-resistant materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Nov 2013 02:23:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-06"}

First, we develop a smoothing result for initial metrics with\nsmall energy and a volume growth lower bound, in the vein of Perelman's\npseudolocality result. Next, we generalize our technique from prior work to\nexhibit local smoothing estimates for the $L^2$ flow in the presence of a\ncurvature-related bound. A final key ingredient is a new local\n$\\epsilon$-regularity result for $L^2$-critical metrics with possibly\nnonconstant scalar curvature.

Whether or not\nthe acceleration is driven by some form of dark energy, and in the absence of a\nwell-based theory to interpret the observations, many models have been proposed\nto solve this problem, both in the context of General Relativity and\nalternative theories of gravity. Actually, a further possibility to investigate\nthe nature of dark energy lies in measuring the dark energy equation of state\n(EOS), w, and its time (or redshift) dependence at high accuracy. However,\nsince w(z) is not directly accessible to measurement, reconstruction methods\nare needed to extract it reliably from observations. Here we investigate\ndifferent models of dark energy, described through several parametrizations of\nthe EOS. Our high-redshift analysis is based on the Union2 Type Ia Supernovae\n(SNIa) data set, the Hubble diagram constructed from some Gamma Ray Bursts\n(GRBs) luminosity distance indicators, and Gaussian priors on the distance from\nthe Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), and the Hubble constant h (these priors\nhave been included in order to help break the degeneracies among model\nparameters). To perform our statistical analysis and to explore the probability\ndistributions of the EOS parameters we use the Markov Chain Monte Carlo Method\n(MCMC). It turns out that the dark energy equation of state is evolving for all\nthe parametrizations that we considered. We finally compare our results with\nthe ones obtained by previous cosmographic analysis performed on the same\nastronomical datasets, showing that the latter ones are sufficient to test and\ncompare the new parametrizations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Nov 2013 09:29:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

In this paper we explore the effect of photometric errors on\nthe stellar metallicity distribution derived from the color distribution of the\nRed Giant Branch stars in the central regions of galaxies at the distance of\nthe Virgo cluster. We focus on the analysis of the Color-Magnitude Diagrams at\ndifferent radii in a typical giant Elliptical galaxy obtained from synthetic\ndata constructed to exemplify observations of the European Extremely Large\nTelescope. The simulations adopt the specifications of the first light high\nresolution imager MICADO and the expected performance of the Multi-Conjugate\nAdaptive Optics Module MAORY. We find that the foreseen photometric accuracy\nallows us to recover the shape of the metallicity distribution with a\nresolution $\\lesssim 0.4$ dex in the inner regions ($\\mu_{\\rm B}$ = 20.5 mag\narcsec$^{-2}$) and $\\simeq 0.2$ dex in regions with $\\mu_{\\rm B}$ = 21.6 mag\narcsec$^{-2}$, that corresponds to approximately half of the effective radius\nfor a typical giant elliptical in Virgo. At the effective radius ($\\mu_{\\rm B}\n\\simeq 23$ mag arcsec$^{-2}$), the metallicity distribution is recovered with a\nresolution of $\\simeq 0.1$ dex. It will thus be possible to study in detail the\nmetallicity gradient of the stellar population over (almost) the whole\nextension of galaxies in Virgo. We also evaluate the impact of moderate\ndegradations of the Point Spread Function from the assumed optimal conditions\nand find similar results, showing that this science case is robust.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Nov 2013 10:03:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

Besides, by power\ncontrol, D2D SINR degrades, which will naturally contribute to low interference\nto cellular communication. A simple mode selection method of D2D communication\nis introduced. Based on path-loss (PL) mode selection criterion, D2D gives\nbetter performance than traditional cellular system. When D2D pair is farther\naway from the BS, a better results can be obtained. Game theory, which offers a\nwide variety of analytical tools to study the complex interactions of players\nand predict their choices, can be used for power and radio resource management\nin D2D communication. A reverse iterative combinatorial auction is formulated\nas a mechanism to allocate the spectrum resources for D2D communications with\nmultiple user pairs sharing the same channel. In addition, a game theoretic\napproach is developed to implement joint scheduling, power control and channel\nallocation for D2D communication. Finally, joint power and spectrum resource\nallocation method is studied under consideration of battery lifetime, which is\nan important application of D2D communication on increasing user's energy\nefficiency. The simulation results show that all these methods have beneficial\neffects on improving the system performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Nov 2013 11:33:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-06"}

We\nanalyze and critically review the most recent measurements of complete angular\ndistributions of the outgoing gamma-rays at very low energies (Ecm > 1.0 MeV).\nOur analysis of the angular distribution measured with the EUROGAM/GANDI arrays\nlead us to conclude considerably larger error bars than published hence they\nare excluded from the current sample of \"world data\".

We point to a much neglected discrepancy between\nthe measured E1-E2 phase difference (phi_12) and unitarity as required by the\nWatson theorem, suggesting systematic problem(s) of some of the measured\ngamma-ray angular distributions. The ambiguity of the extrapolated SE2(300)\ntogether with a previously observed ambiguity of SE1(300) represent the current\nstate of the art of the field and they must be resolved by future measurements\nof complete and detailed angular distributions of the 12C(a,g) reaction at very\nlow energies (Ecm < 1.0 MeV).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Nov 2013 13:04:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 8 Nov 2013 17:37:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-05"}

The geometric analysis, stemming from the direct acoustic\npropagation model, leads to necessary and sufficient conditions for a set of\ntime delays to correspond to a unique position in the source space. Such sets\nof time delays are referred to as feasible sets. We formally prove that every\nfeasible set corresponds to exactly one position in the source space, whose\nvalue can be recovered using a closed-form localization mapping. Therefore we\nseek for the optimal feasible set of time delays given, as input, the received\nmicrophone signals.

We construct an algorithm based on RUS\ncircuits that approximates an arbitrary single-qubit $Z$-axis rotation to\nwithin distance $\\epsilon$, where the number of $T$ gates scales as\n$1.26\\log_2(1/\\epsilon) - 3.53$, an improvement of roughly three-fold over\nstate-of-the-art techniques. We then extend our algorithm and show that a\nscaling of $2.4\\log_2(1/\\epsilon) - 3.28$ can be achieved for arbitrary\nunitaries and a small range of $\\epsilon$, which is roughly twice as good as\noptimal deterministic decomposition methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Nov 2013 14:42:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 19 Oct 2014 18:58:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-21"}

Phenomena inherent to quantum theory\non curved space-time, such as Hawking radiation, are typically assumed to be\nonly relevant at extreme physical conditions: at high energies and in strong\ngravitational fields. Here we consider low-energy quantum mechanics in the\npresence of gravitational time dilation and show that the latter leads to\ndecoherence of quantum superpositions. Time dilation induces a universal\ncoupling between internal degrees of freedom and the centre-of-mass of a\ncomposite particle. The resulting correlations cause decoherence of the\nparticle's position, even without any external environment. We also show that\nthe weak time dilation on Earth is already sufficient to decohere micron scale\nobjects. Gravity therefore can account for the emergence of classicality and\nthe effect can in principle be tested in future matter wave experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Nov 2013 15:48:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Jun 2015 16:00:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-02"}

Monoceros R2 (Mon R2), at a distance of 830 pc, is the only\nultra-compact H ii region (UC H ii) where its associated photon-dominated\nregion (PDR) can be resolved with the Herschel Space Observatory. Aims. Our aim\nis to investigate observationally the kinematical patterns in the interface\nregions (i.e., the transition from atomic to molecular gas) associated with Mon\nR2. Methods. We used the HIFI instrument onboard Herschel to observe the line\nprofiles of the reactive ions CH+, OH+ and H2O+ toward different positions in\nMon R2. We derive the column density of these molecules and compare them with\ngas-phase chemistry models. Results. The reactive ion CH+ is detected both in\nemission (at central and red-shifted velocities) and in absorption (at\nblue-shifted velocities). OH+ is detected in absorption at both blue- and\nred-shifted velocities, with similar column densities. H2O+ is not detected at\nany of the positions, down to a rms of 40 mK toward the molecular peak. At this\nposition, we find that the OH+ absorption originates in a mainly atomic medium,\nand therefore is associated with the most exposed layers of the PDR. These\nresults are consistent with the predictions from photo-chemical models. The\nline profiles are consistent with the atomic gas being entrained in the ionized\ngas flow along the walls of the cavity of the H ii region. Based on this\nevidence, we are able to propose a new geometrical model for this region.\nConclusions. The kinematical patterns of the OH+ and CH+ absorption indicate\nthe existence of a layer of mainly atomic gas for which we have derived, for\nthe first time, some physical parameters and its dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Nov 2013 15:56:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}
