Each station consists of 48 individual silicon\nsensors, each of which contains two columns of mini-strips with 75 $\\mu$m pitch\nin the radial direction and lengths in the $\\phi$ direction varying from 3.4 mm\nat the inner radius to 11.5 mm at the outer radius. The FVTX has approximately\n0.54 million strips in each endcap. These are read out with FPHX chips,\ndeveloped in collaboration with Fermilab, which are wire bonded directly to the\nmini-strips. The maximum strip occupancy reached in central Au-Au collisions is\napproximately 2.8%. The precision tracking provided by this device makes the\nidentification of muons from secondary vertices away from the primary event\nvertex possible. The expected distance of closest approach (DCA) resolution of\n200 $\\mu$m or better for particles with a transverse momentum of 5 GeV/$c$ will\nallow identification of muons from relatively long-lived particles, such as $D$\nand $B$ mesons, through their broader DCA distributions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Nov 2013 18:13:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 14 Feb 2014 19:18:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

The pronounced stellar pulsations, showing periods comparable to the\nprimary transit duration, interfere with the transit modeling. Therefore our\nmain goal is to study the pulsation spectrum of the host star to redetermine\nthe orbital parameters of the system by means of pulsation-cleaned primary\ntransit light curves. Between August 2010 and October 2012 we obtained 457\nhours of photometry of WASP-33 using small and middle-class telescopes located\nmostly in Spain and in Germany. Our observations comprise the wavelength range\nbetween the blue and the red, and provide full phase coverage of the planetary\norbit. After a careful detrend, we focus our pulsation studies in the high\nfrequency regime, where the pulsations that mostly deform the primary transit\nexist. The data allow us to identify, for the first time in the system, eight\nsignificant pulsation frequencies. The pulsations are likely associated with\nlow-order p-modes. Furthermore, we find that pulsation phases evolve in time.\nWe use our knowledge of the pulsations to clean the primary transit light\ncurves and carry out an improved transit modeling. Surprisingly, taking into\naccount the pulsations in the modeling has little influence on the derived\norbital parameters. However, the uncertainties in the best-fit parameters\ndecrease. Additionally, we find indications for a possible dependence between\nwavelength and transit depth, but only with marginal significance. A clear\npulsation solution, in combination with an accurate orbital period, allows us\nto extend our studies and search for star-planet interactions (SPI). Although\nwe find no conclusive evidence of SPI, we believe that the pulsation nature of\nthe host star and the proximity between members make WASP-33 a promising system\nfor further SPI studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Nov 2013 19:22:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

However, the\ndetection of planets around young stars is hampered by the increased stellar\nactivity associated with young stars, the signatures of which can bias the\ndetection of planets. In this paper we place realistic limitations on the\npossibilities for detecting planets around young active G and K dwarfs. The\nmodels of stellar activity based on tomographic imaging of the G dwarf HD\n141943 and the K1 dwarf AB Dor and also include contributions from plage and\nmany small random starspots. Our results show that the increased stellar\nactivity levels present on young Solar-type stars strongly impacts the\ndetection of Earth-mass and Jupiter mass planets and that the degree of\nactivity jitter is directly correlated with stellar \\vsinis. We also show that\nfor G and K dwarfs, the distribution of activity in individual stars is more\nimportant than the differences in induced radial velocities as a function of\nspectral type. We conclude that Jupiter mass planets can be detected close-in\naround fast-rotating young active stars, Neptune-mass planets around moderate\nrotators and that Super-Earths are only detectable around very slowly rotating\nstars. The effects of an increase in stellar activity jitter by observing\nyounger stars can be compensated for by extending the observational base-line\nto at least 100 epochs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Nov 2013 19:27:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

The goal is to obtain a non-anticipatory\npolicy to run jobs at different vertices, that maximizes expected reward,\nsubject to the total distance traveled plus processing times being at most $B$.\nAn adaptive policy is one that can choose the next vertex to visit based on\nobserved random instantiations.

The requirements are\nspecified with a new contract language specifically designed for SoS, targeting\na high-level English- pattern language, but relying on an accurate semantics\ngiven by the standard temporal logics. The contracts are verified against the\nUPDM/SysML specification using the Statistical Model Checker (SMC) PLASMA\ncombined with the simulation engine DESYRE, which integrates heterogeneous\nbehavioral models through the functional mock-up interface (FMI) standard. The\ntool-chain allows computing an estimation of the satisfiability of the\ncontracts by the SoS. The results help the system architect to trade-off\ndifferent solutions to guide the evolution of the SoS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Nov 2013 19:41:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-15"}

These results have, however, shown that our\nunderstanding of GRB physics is still unsatisfactory. The new generation of\nCherenkov observatories and in particular the MAGIC telescope, allow for the\nfirst time the possibility to extend the measurement of GRBs from several tens\nup to hundreds of GeV energy range. Both leptonic and hadronic processes have\nbeen suggested to explain the possible GeV/TeV counterpart of GRBs.\nObservations with ground-based telescopes of very high energy photons (E>30\nGeV) from these sources are going to play a key role in discriminating among\nthe different proposed emission mechanisms, which are barely distinguishable at\nlower energies. MAGIC telescope observations of the GRB 090102 (z=1.547) field\nand Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) data in the same time interval are\nanalysed to derive upper limits of the GeV/TeV emission. We compare these\nresults to the expected emissions evaluated for different processes in the\nframework of a relativistic blast wave model for the afterglow. Simultaneous\nupper limits with Fermi and a Cherenkov telescope have been derived for this\nGRB observation. The results we obtained are compatible with the expected\nemission although the difficulties in predicting the HE and VHE emission for\nthe afterglow of this event makes it difficult to draw firmer conclusions.\nNonetheless, MAGIC sensitivity in the energy range of overlap with space-based\ninstruments (above about 40 GeV) is about one order of magnitude better with\nrespect to Fermi. This makes evident the constraining power of ground-based\nobservations and shows that the MAGIC telescope has reached the required\nperformance to make possible GRB multiwavelength studies in the very high\nenergy range.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Nov 2013 19:52:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-15"}

A major discriminant between\ndifferent suggested models is the presence and physical properties of\ncircumstellar material at the time of explosion.

Previous studies have shown that the\nstrongest effect is seen in the neutral sodium D lines. We report on\nobservations of neutral sodium absorption features observed in multi-epoch\nhigh-resolution spectra of 14 Type Ia supernova events. This is the first\nmulti-epoch high-resolution study to include multiple SNe.

However, tensors pose significant algorithmic challenges\nand tensors analogs of much of the matrix algebra toolkit are unlikely to exist\nbecause of hardness results. Efficient decomposition in the overcomplete case\n(where rank exceeds dimension) is particularly challenging. We introduce a\nsmoothed analysis model for studying these questions and develop an efficient\nalgorithm for tensor decomposition in the highly overcomplete case (rank\npolynomial in the dimension). In this setting, we show that our algorithm is\nrobust to inverse polynomial error -- a crucial property for applications in\nlearning since we are only allowed a polynomial number of samples. While\nalgorithms are known for exact tensor decomposition in some overcomplete\nsettings, our main contribution is in analyzing their stability in the\nframework of smoothed analysis.\n  Our main technical contribution is to show that tensor products of perturbed\nvectors are linearly independent in a robust sense (i.e. the associated matrix\nhas singular values that are at least an inverse polynomial). This key result\npaves the way for applying tensor methods to learning problems in the smoothed\nsetting.

The assumption here is that the model is not\nadversarially chosen, formalized by a perturbation of model parameters.

Recent numerical\nsimulations have shown how pillars can arise from the collapse of the shell in\non itself and how globules can be formed from the interplay of the turbulent\nmolecular cloud and the ionization from massive stars. The goal here is to test\nthis scenario through recent observations of two massive star-forming regions,\nM16 and Rosette. The column density structure of the interface between\nmolecular clouds and H ii regions was characterized using column density maps\nobtained from far-infrared imaging of the Herschel HOBYS key programme. Then,\nthe DisPerSe algorithm was used on these maps to detect the compressed layers\naround the ionized gas and pillars in different evolutionary states. Finally,\ntheir velocity structure was investigated using CO data, and all observational\nsignatures were tested against some distinct diagnostics established from\nsimulations. The column density profiles have revealed the importance of\ncompression at the edge of the ionized gas. The velocity properties of the\nstructures, i.e. pillars and globules, are very close to what we predict from\nthe numerical simulations. We have identified a good candidate of a nascent\npillar in the Rosette molecular cloud that presents the velocity pattern of the\nshell collapsing on itself, induced by a high local curvature. Globules have a\nbulk velocity dispersion that indicates the importance of the initial\nturbulence in their formation, as proposed from numerical simulations.\nAltogether, this study re-enforces the picture of pillar formation by shell\ncollapse and globule formation by the ionization of highly turbulent clouds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Nov 2013 21:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

No clear evolution of Mdust is observed at fixed SFR and Mstar.\nWe find a tight correlation between SFR and Mdust, likely a consequence of the\nSchmidt-Kennicutt (S-K) law. The Mstar-Mdust correlation observed by previous\nworks flattens or sometimes disappears when fixing the SFR. Most of it likely\nderives from the combination of the Mdust-SFR and Mstar-SFR correlations.

The gas\nfraction (fgas) decreases with Mstar and increases with SFR, and does not\nevolve with z at fixed Mstar and SFR. We explain these trends by introducing a\nuniversal relation between fgas, Mstar and SFR, non-evolving out to z~2.5.\nGalaxies move across this relation as their gas content evolves in time. We use\nthe 3D fundamental fgas-Mstar-SFR relation and the redshift evolution of the\nMain Sequence to estimate the evolution of fgas in the average population of\ngalaxies as a function of z and Mstar, and we find evidence a downsizing\nscenario.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Nov 2013 21:01:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

We then select the heavily obscured\nAGN candidates by comparing their 12 micron AGN luminosity to the observed 2-10\nkeV X-ray luminosity and their expected intrinsic relation. With this approach\nwe find 20 candidates, and we examine their X-ray and optical spectra. Of the\n20 initial candidates, we find nine (64%; out of the 14, for which X-ray\nspectra could be fit) based on the X-ray spectra, and seven (78%; out of the\nnine detected spectroscopically in the SDSS) based on the [OIII] line fluxes.\nCombining all criteria, we determine the final number of heavily obscured AGN\nto be 12-19, and the number of Compton-thick AGN to be 2-5, showing that the\nmethod is reliable in finding obscured AGN, but not Compton-thick. However\nthose numbers are smaller than what would be expected from X-ray background\npopulation synthesis models, which demonstrates how the optical-infrared\nselection and the scatter of the L_x-L_MIR relation introduced by observational\nconstraints limit the efficiency of the method. Finally, we test popular\nobscured AGN selection methods based on mid-infrared colours, and find that the\nprobability of an AGN to be selected by its mid-infrared colours increases with\nthe X-ray luminosity. However, a selection scheme based on a relatively low\nX-ray luminosity and mid-infrared colours characteristic of QSOs would not\nselect ~25% of the heavily obscured AGN of our sample.

Reconnection in the current\nsheet relaxes this highly stressed configuration to a lower energy state. This\nscenario is most familiar, and most often studied, in flares, where the flux\ntransfer is rapid. We present here a study of steady, quiescent flux transfer\noccurring at a rate three orders of magnitude below that in a large flare. In\nparticular we quantify the reconnection rate, and related energy release,\noccurring as new polarity emerges to form Active Region 11112\n(2010-10-16T00:S18W14) within a region of preexisting flux. A bright, low lying\nkernel of coronal loops above the emerging polarity, observed with AIA onboard\nSDO and XRT onboard Hinode, originally shows magnetic connectivity only between\nregions of newly emerged flux when overlaid on magnetograms from HMI. Over the\ncourse of several days, this bright kernel advances into the preexisting flux.\nThe advancement of an easily visible boundary into the old flux regions allows\nmeasurement of the rate of reconnection between old and new magnetic domains.\nWe compare the reconnection rate to the inferred heating of the coronal plasma.\nTo our knowledge, this is the first measurement of steady, quiescent heating\nrelated to reconnection. We determine that the newly emerged flux reconnects at\na fairly steady rate of 0.38e16 Mx/s over two days, while the radiated power\nvaries between 2~8e25 erg/s over the same time. We find that as much as 40% of\nthe total emerged flux at any given time may have reconnected.

With an ever increasing demand for storing such reads for\nfuture studies, the issue of efficient metagenomic compression becomes of\nparamount importance. We present the first known approach to metagenome read\ncompression, termed MCUIUC (Metagenomic Compression at UIUC). The gist of the\nproposed algorithm is to perform classification of reads based on unique\norganism identifiers, followed by reference-based alignment of reads for\nindividually identified organisms, and metagenomic assembly of unclassified\nreads. Once assembly and classification are completed, lossless reference based\ncompression is performed via positional encoding. We evaluate the performance\nof the algorithm on moderate sized synthetic metagenomic samples involving 15\nrandomly selected organisms and describe future directions for improving the\nproposed compression method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Nov 2013 03:57:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-20"}

We design a deterministic fully\npolynomial-time approximation scheme (FPTAS) for counting the number of\nsatisfying assignments for a given monotone CNF formula when each variable\nappears in at most $5$ clauses. Equivalently, this is also an FPTAS for\ncounting set covers where each set contains at most $5$ elements.

In addition, we\nstudy the hypergraph matching problem, which arises naturally towards a\ncomplete classification of bounded degree Boolean #CSP problems, and show an\nFPTAS for counting 3D matchings of hypergraphs with maximum degree $4$.\n  Our main technique is correlation decay, a powerful tool to design\ndeterministic FPTAS for counting problems defined by local constraints among a\nnumber of variables.

Therefore we resort to the (by now\nwell-established) vanishing viscosity approach to rate-independent modeling,\nand approximate the model by its viscous regularization. In fact, the analysis\nof the latter PDE system presents remarkable difficulties, due to its highly\nnonlinear character. We tackle it by combining a variational approach to a\nclass of abstract doubly nonlinear evolution equations, with careful regularity\nestimates tailored to this specific system, relying on a q-Laplacian type\ngradient regularization of the damage variable. Hence for the viscous problem\nwe conclude the existence of weak solutions, satisfying a suitable\nenergy-dissipation inequality that is the starting point for the vanishing\nviscosity analysis.

In\nparticular, we are interested in the close-packing limit (jamming) and the\nquestion if \"universal\" observables can be identified that do not depend on the\ndetails of the dissipation model. To this end, we define a simplified\nlubrication force and systematically vary the range $h_c$ of this interaction.\nFor fixed $h_c$ a cross-over is seen from a Newtonian flow regime at small\nstrain rates to inertia-dominated flow at larger strain rates. The same\ncross-over is observed as a function of the lubrication range $h_c$. At the\nsame time, but only at high densities close to jamming, particle velocity as\nwell as local density distributions are unaffected by changes in the\nlubrication range -- they are candidates for \"universal\" behavior. At densities\naway from jamming, this universality is lost: short-range lubrication forces\nlead to pronounced particle clustering, while longer-ranged lubrication does\nnot. These findings highlight the importance of \"geometric\" packing constraints\nfor particle motion -- independent of the specific dissipation model. With the\nfree volume vanishing at random-close packing, particle motion is more and more\nconstrained by the ever smaller amount of free space. On the other side,\nmacroscopic rheological observables, as well as higher-order correlation\nfunctions retain the variability of the underlying dissipation model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Nov 2013 07:53:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Mar 2014 17:07:33 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 26 May 2014 19:53:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-27"}

In the RPA calculation, the\nprecession motion of the torus isomer is generated by coherent superposition of\nmany one-particle-one-hole excitations across the sloping Fermi surface that\nstrongly violates the time-reversal symmetry.

Thus, we face a\nmajor problem to aggregate different similarities. Some matching systems use\nexperimental weights for aggregation of similarities among different matchers\nwhile others use machine learning approaches and optimization algorithms to\nfind optimal weights to assign to different matchers. However, both approaches\nhave their own deficiencies. In this paper, we will point out the problems and\nshortcomings of current similarity aggregation strategies.

The study of BL Lac objects (BLL) detected in gamma-rays gives\ninsights on the acceleration mechanisms in play in such systems and is also a\nvaluable tool to constrain the density of the extragalactic background light.\nAs their spectra are dominated by the non-thermal emission of the jet and the\nspectral features are weak and narrow in the optical domain, measuring their\nredshift is challenging. However such a measure is fundamental as it allows a\nfirm determination of the distance and luminosity of the source, and therefore\na consistent model of its emission. Aims. Measurement of the redshift of BLL\ndetected in gamma-rays and determination of global properties of their host\ngalaxies. Methods. We observed a sample of eight BLL (KUV 00311-1938, PKS\n0447-439, PKS 0301-243, BZB J0238-3116, BZB J0543-5532, BZB J0505+0415, BZB\nJ0816-1311 and RBS 334) with the X-shooter spectrograph installed at the ESO\nVery Large Telescope in order to take advantage of its unprecedented wavelength\ncoverage and of its resolution about 5 times higher than generally used in such\nstudies.

The existing tension between Planck determination of these\nparameters in the frame of the base LambdaCDM model and their direct\nmeasurements generated lively discussions and several interpretations. In this\npaper we quantify this tension by exploring several extensions of the base\nLambdaCDM model that include the leptonic asymmetry. We set bounds on the\nradiation content of the Universe and neutrino properties by using the latest\ncosmological measurements, imposing also self-consistent BBN constraints on the\nprimordial helium abundance. For all cosmological asymmetric models we find the\npreference of cosmological data for smaller values of active and sterile\nneutrino masses. This increases the tension between cosmological and short\nbaseline neutrino oscillation data that favor a sterile neutrino with the mass\nof around 1 eV. For the case of degenerate massive neutrinos, we find that the\ndiscrepancies with direct determinations of the Hubble constant, the present\ncluster abundances and the age of the Universe are alleviated at ~ 1.3 sigma\nfor all leptonic asymmetric models. We also find ~2 sigma statistical evidence\nof the preference of cosmological data for the normal neutrino hierarchy. This\nis more evident for the case of cosmological models involving leptonic\nasymmetry and three massive neutrino species. We conclude that the current\ncosmological data favor the leptonic asymmetric extension of the base LambdaCDM\nmodel and normal neutrino mass hierarchy over the models with additional\nsterile neutrino species and/or inverted neutrino mass hierarchy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Nov 2013 14:15:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Jan 2014 12:46:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-11"}

Our study intends to shed light on the ongoing debate\nof whether a structural evolution from present-day star-forming dwarf galaxies\nin a cluster environment into ordinary early-type dwarf galaxies is possible\nbased on the structural properties.\n  For this purpose, we decompose the surface brightness profiles of the BCDs\ninto the luminosity contribution of the starburst component and that of their\nunderlying low surface brightness (LSB) host. The latter dominates the stellar\nmass of the BCD. We find that the LSB-components of the Virgo BCDs are\nstructurally compatible with the more compact half of the Virgo early-type\ndwarfs, except for a few extreme BCDs. Thus, after termination of starburst\nactivity, the BCDs will presumably fade into galaxies that are structurally\nsimilar to ordinary early-type dwarfs. In contrast, the irregulars are more\ndiffuse than the BCDs and are structurally similar to the more diffuse half of\nthe Virgo early-type dwarfs. Therefore, the present-day Virgo irregulars are\nnot simply non-starbursting BCDs.\n  If starbursts in cluster BCDs are transient phenomena with a duration of ~100\nMyr or less, during which the galaxies could not travel more than ~100 kpc,\nthen a substantial number of non-starbursting counterparts of these systems\nmust populate the same spatial volume, namely the Virgo cluster outskirts. The\nmajority of them would have to be early-type dwarfs, based on the abundance of\ndifferent galaxy types with similar colours and structural parameters to the\nLSB-components of the BCDs. However, most Virgo BCDs have redder LSB-host\ncolours and a less prominent starburst than typical field BCDs, preventing a\nrobust conclusion on possible oscillations between BCDs and early-type dwarfs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Nov 2013 12:07:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

From these effects, they could\nimply the existence of one thermal vacuum in different circumstances. The\nimaginary-time hamiltonian of the vacuum is found to provide not only exact\ndistribution functions in the calculations of the Casimir effect and the Van\nder Waals force but also cutoff functions. The thermal bath for the Unruh\neffect is constructed from the imaginary-time Green function. From the field\ntheory in the curved space-time, field quantizations are defined according to\ndifferent vacuum states and lead to the Hawking radiation; the introduced\nconformal invariance agree with the formalism of the imaginary-time field\ntheory. The induced Green functions in the curved space-time are in accordance\nwith those from the picture given from the thermal vacuum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Nov 2013 18:18:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 2 Dec 2013 02:49:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-03"}
