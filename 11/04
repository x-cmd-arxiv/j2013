We observed a surprisingly complex magnetic behavior with three\nsuccesive phase transitions. The Eu2+ moments order in a likely\namplitude-modulated structure below 24.5K, undergoing a further transition to a\nstructure that is possibly of the equal moment type, and a first order\ntransition at lower temperatures, presumably into a spin spiral structure. The\nsharp metamagnetic transition observed at low fields applied perpendicular to\nthe hard axis is consistent with a change from a spiral to a fan structure.\nThese magnetic structures are presumably formed by ferromagnetic planes\nperpendicular to the c axis, stacked antiferromagnetically along c but not of\ntype I, at least just below the ordering temperature. Since EuRh2Si2 is\nisoelectronic to EuFe2As2, our results are also relevant for the complex\nEu-magnetism observed there, especially for the transition from an\nantiferromagnetic to a ferromagnetic state observed in EuFe2P2 upon\nsubstituting As by P.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Nov 2013 16:05:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-23"}

The\nmismatch of expansion rate between the exocarp and sarcocarp can produce a\ncompressive stress on the exocarp. We model a fruit/vegetable with exocarp and\nsarcocarp as a hyperelastic layer-substrate structure subjected to uniaxial\ncompression. The derived bifurcation condition contains both geometrical and\nmaterial constants. However, a careful analysis on this condition leads to the\nfinding of a critical thickness ratio which separates the buckling and\nwrinkling modes, and remarkably, which is independent of the material\nstiffnesses. More specifically, it is found that if the thickness ratio is\nsmaller than this critical value a fruit/vegetable should be in a buckling mode\n(under a sufficient stress); if a fruit/vegetable in a wrinkled shape the\nthickness ratio is always larger than this critical value. To verify the\ntheoretical prediction, we consider four types of buckled fruits/vegetables and\nfour types of wrinkled fruits/vegetables with three samples in each type.

Freiling's Axiom\nof Symmetry (AS) is one candidate for an intuitively justifiable axiom that,\nwhen appended to ZFC, is equivalent to the denial of CH. The intuition relies\non a probabalistic argument, usually cast in terms of throwing random darts at\nthe real line, and has been defended by researchers as well as popular writers.\nIn this note, the intuitive argument is reviewed.

We suggest that the clump forms as its\nparent cloud collapses more along the large scale B field. In this process, the\nnorthern part carries over most of the angular momentum, forming a fast\nrotating system, and pulls the B field into a toroidal configuration. In\ncontrast, the southern part is not significantly rotating and the B field\nremains in a poloidal configuration. A statistical analysis of the observed\npolarization dispersion yields a B field strength of ~ 1 mG, a\nturbulent-to-magnetic energy ratio of order unity, and a mass-to-magnetic flux\nratio of ~ 2--3 in units of the critical value. Detailed calculations support\nour hypothesis that the B field in the northern part is being rotationally\ndistorted. Our observations, in conjunction with early single-dish data,\nsuggest that the B field may play a critical role in the formation of the dense\nclump, whereas rotation and turbulence could also be important in further\ndynamical evolution of the clump.

A still unresolved question is whether the efficient coding\nhypothesis explains formation of neurons which explicitly represent\nenvironmental features of different functional importance. This paper proposes\nthat the spatial selectivity of higher auditory neurons emerges as a direct\nconsequence of learning efficient codes for natural binaural sounds. Firstly,\nit is demonstrated that a linear efficient coding transform - Independent\nComponent Analysis (ICA) trained on spectrograms of naturalistic simulated\nbinaural sounds extracts spatial information present in the signal. A simple\nhierarchical ICA extension allowing for decoding of sound position is proposed.\nFurthermore, it is shown that units revealing spatial selectivity can be\nlearned from a binaural recording of a natural auditory scene. In both cases a\nrelatively small subpopulation of learned spectrogram features suffices to\nperform accurate sound localization. Representation of the auditory space is\ntherefore learned in a purely unsupervised way by maximizing the coding\nefficiency and without any task-specific constraints. This results imply that\nefficient coding is a useful strategy for learning structures which allow for\nmaking behaviorally vital inferences about the environment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Nov 2013 08:51:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 Feb 2014 12:31:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-18"}

They are\nneeded to characterise the performance of instruments and are paramount for\nphotometric calibration. During the Herschel Calibration Asteroid Preparatory\nProgramme approximately 50 asteroids have been established as far-IR/sub-mm/mm\ncalibrators for Herschel. The selected asteroids fill the flux gap between the\nsub-mm/mm calibrators Mars, Uranus and Neptune, and the mid-IR bright\ncalibration stars. All three Herschel instruments observed asteroids for\nvarious calibration purposes, including pointing tests, absolute flux\ncalibration, relative spectral response function, observing mode validation,\nand cross-calibration aspects. Here we present newly established models for the\nfour large and well characterized main-belt asteroids (1) Ceres, (2) Pallas,\n(4) Vesta, and (21) Lutetia which can be considered as new prime flux\ncalibrators. The relevant object-specific properties (size, shape,\nspin-properties, albedo, thermal properties) are well established. The seasonal\n(distance to Sun, distance to observer, phase angle, aspect angle) and daily\nvariations (rotation) are included in a new thermophysical model setup for\nthese targets. The thermophysical model predictions agree within 5% with the\navailable (and independently calibrated) Herschel measurements. The four\nobjects cover the flux regime from just below 1,000 Jy (Ceres at mid-IR\nN-/Q-band) down to fluxes below 0.1 Jy (Lutetia at the longest wavelengths).\nBased on the comparison with PACS, SPIRE and HIFI measurements and pre-Herschel\nexperience, the validity of these new prime calibrators ranges from\nmid-infrared to about 700 micron, connecting nicely the absolute stellar\nreference system in the mid-IR with the planet-based calibration at sub-mm/mm\nwavelengths.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Nov 2013 10:03:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-05"}

In many Fermi systems and compounds at zero\ntemperature a phase transition happens that leads to a quite specific state\ncalled fermion condensation. As a signal of such a fermion condensation quantum\nphase transition (FCQPT) serves unlimited increase of the effective mass of\nquasiparticles that determines the excitation spectrum and creates flat bands.\nWe show that the class of Fermi liquids with the fermion condensate forms a new\nstate of matter.

It is demonstrated that a huge\namount of experimental data collected on different compounds suggests that\nthey, starting from some temperature and down, form the new state of matter,\nand are governed by the fermion condensation. Our discussion shows that the\ntheory of fermion condensation develops completely good description of the NFL\nbehavior of strongly correlated Fermi systems. Moreover, the fermion\ncondensation can be considered as the universal reason for the NFL behavior\nobserved in various HF metals, liquids, compounds with quantum spin liquids,\nand quasicrystals. We show that these systems exhibit universal scaling\nbehavior of their thermodynamic properties. Therefore, the quantum critical\nphysics of different strongly correlated compounds is universal, and emerges\nregardless of the underlying microscopic details of the compounds. This uniform\nbehavior, governed by the universal quantum critical physics, allows us to view\nit as the main characteristic of the new state of matter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Nov 2013 10:08:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-30"}

We specifically address the diffraction problem,\nshowing that deconvolution normally used to recover diffraction blur can be\nreplaced by convolution of the sensing matrix, and how measurements of a 0/1\nphysical sensing matrix can be converted to -1/1 compressive sensing matrix\nwithout any extra acquisitions. Simulations of our architecture show that the\nimage quality is comparable to that of a classic Compressive Imaging camera,\nwhereas the proposed architecture avoids long acquisition times due to\nsequential sensing. This one-shot procedure also allows to employ a fixed\nsensing matrix instead of a complex device such as a Digital Micro Mirror array\nor Spatial Light Modulator. It also enables imaging at bandwidths where these\nare not efficient.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Nov 2013 11:07:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-05"}

Yet, most\nphylogeneticists seek to reveal the history of species. Although the histories\nof genes and species are tightly linked, they are seldom identical, because\ngenes duplicate, are lost or horizontally transferred, and because alleles can\nco-exist in populations for periods that may span several speciation events.\nBuilding models describing the relationship between gene and species trees can\nthus improve the reconstruction of gene trees when a species tree is known, and\nvice-versa. Several approaches have been proposed to solve the problem in one\ndirection or the other, but in general neither gene trees nor species trees are\nknown. Only a few studies have attempted to jointly infer gene trees and\nspecies trees. In this article we review the various models that have been used\nto describe the relationship between gene trees and species trees. These models\naccount for gene duplication and loss, transfer or incomplete lineage sorting.\nSome of them consider several types of events together, but none exists\ncurrently that considers the full repertoire of processes that generate gene\ntrees along the species tree. Simulations as well as empirical studies on\ngenomic data show that combining gene tree-species tree models with models of\nsequence evolution improves gene tree reconstruction. In turn, these better\ngene trees provide a better basis for studying genome evolution or\nreconstructing ancestral chromosomes and ancestral gene sequences. We predict\nthat gene tree-species tree methods that can deal with genomic data sets will\nbe instrumental to advancing our understanding of genomic evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Nov 2013 11:34:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-05"}

The same dilemma occurs within the\nBayesian framework with respect to the estimation of the Bayesian marginal (or\nintegrated) likelihood, which is the main tool for model comparison and\naveraging. In most cases, the Bayesian marginal likelihood is a high\ndimensional integral that cannot be computed analytically and a plethora of\nmethods based on Monte Carlo integration (MCI) are used for its estimation. In\nthis work, it is shown that the joint MCI approach makes subtle use of the\nproperties of the adopted model, leading to increased error and bias in finite\nsettings.

Via aberration-corrected transmission\nelectron microscopy, we demonstrate reversible and extended pentagon-heptagon\n(5-7) reconstruction at zigzag edges, and explore experimentally and\ntheoretically the dynamics of the transitions between configuration states.\nGood theoretical-experimental agreement is found for the flipping rates between\n5-7 and 6-6 zigzag edge states. Our study demonstrates that simple ripping is\nremarkably effective in producing atomically clean, ideal terminations thus\nproviding a valuable tool for realizing atomically-tailored graphene and\nfacilitating meaningful experimental study.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Nov 2013 12:09:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-05"}

With much\nlower radiative efficiencies of protons than of electrons, and the recent\nreports of very strong coupling of electrons with shock-heated protons\nindicated by Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulations, the leptonic models seem to be\nstrongly favored over the hadronic ones. However, the electron-proton coupling\ncombined with the ERC (External-Radiation-Compton) models of gamma-ray\nproduction in leptonic models predict extremely hard X-ray spectra, with energy\nindices about 0. This is inconsistent with the observed 2-10 keV slopes of\nblazars, which cluster around an index value of 0.6. This problem can be\nresolved by assuming that electrons can be cooled down radiatively to\nnon-relativistic energies, or that blazar spectra are entirely dominated by the\nSSC (Synchrotron-Self Compton) component up to at least 10 keV. Here, we show\nthat the required cooling can be sufficiently efficient only at distances r <\n0.03pc. SSC spectra, on the other hand, can be produced roughly co-spatially\nwith the observed synchrotron and ERC components, which are most likely located\nroughly at a parsec scale. We show that the dominant SSC component can also be\nproduced much further than the dominant synchrotron and ERC components, at\ndistances larger than 10 parsecs. Hence, depending on the spatial distribution\nof the energy dissipation along the jet, one may expect to see\ngamma-ray/optical events with either correlated or uncorrelated X-rays. In all\ncases the number of electron-positron pairs per proton is predicted to be very\nlow. The direct verification of the proposed SSC scenario requires sensitive\nobservations in the hard X-ray band which is now possible with the NuSTAR\nsatellite.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Nov 2013 12:21:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

Many\nmodern radiative transfer codes, whether using Monte Carlo or ray tracing\ntechniques, are equipped with hierarchical octree-based grids to accommodate a\nwide dynamic range in densities. We critically investigate two different\naspects of octree grids in the framework of Monte Carlo dust radiative\ntransfer. Inspired by their common use in computer graphics applications, we\ntest hierarchical k-d tree grids as an alternative for octree grids. On the\nother hand, we investigate which node subdivision-stopping criteria are optimal\nfor constructing of hierarchical grids. We implemented a k-d tree grid in the\n3D radiative transfer code SKIRT and compared it with the previously\nimplemented octree grid. We also considered three different node\nsubdivision-stopping criteria (based on mass, optical depth, and density\ngradient thresholds). Based on a small suite of test models, we compared the\nefficiency and accuracy of the different grids, according to various quality\nmetrics. For a given set of requirements, the k-d tree grids only require half\nthe number of cells of the corresponding octree. Moreover, for the same number\nof grid cells, the k-d tree is characterized by higher discretization accuracy.\nConcerning the subdivision stopping criteria, we find that an optical depth\ncriterion is not a useful alternative to the more standard mass threshold,\nsince the resulting grids show a poor accuracy. Both criteria can be combined;\nhowever, in the optimal combination, for which we provide a simple approximate\nrecipe, this can lead to a 20% reduction in the number of cells needed to reach\na certain grid quality. An additional density gradient threshold criterion can\nbe added that solves the problem of poorly resolving sharp edges and...\n(abridged).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Nov 2013 14:04:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

More and more mobile phones with\nlarge touchscreen have been produced, however, the phones with small size\ndisplays are still in the majority of touch phones. The foremost interface on\ntouch smartphones is the information input module using soft keyboards.\nTraditional input methods on touch phones have either too small key buttons\n(such as QWERTY) or too many functions (such as 3$\\times$4 keyboard), which are\ninconvenient to use. Moreover, the conventional soft keyboards only use tapping\nto input texts while current touch smartphones allow various gestures on the\ntouchscreen, such as sliding. In this paper, a novel soft keyboard called QWERT\nis proposed for touchscreen-based smartphones. The users can interact with\nphones via finger gestures of tapping or sliding when input text by using the\nQWERT. In doing so, the interactions between users and smartphones will be\nfaster and easier. An experiment carried out on inexperienced human subjects\nshows that they can learn very fast due to their familiarities with QWERTY. A\nsimulation experiment based on a cognitive architecture, ACT-R, was also\nconducted to predict the movement time (MT) of experienced human subjects. The\nsimulation results show that the MT using QWERT outperforms other default\nkeyboards. These outcomes imply that the novel QWERT is a viable option for\ntouch smartphone users. Based on the novel design, an application is released\non Android systems. This application is expected to give better user experience\nfor customers who use touch smartphones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Nov 2013 14:25:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-20"}

We study here the robustness of these tests to the presence of DE\ndensity, velocity, and anisotropic stress perturbations. We find that the\ndispersion in the growth index parameter remains small enough to distinguish\nbetween extreme cases of DE models and some commonly used modified gravity\nmodels. The sign of the slope parameter for a redshift dependent growth index\nwas found to be inconsistent as an additional test in extreme cases of DE\nmodels with perturbations. Next, we studied the effect of DE perturbations on\nthe modified growth (MG) parameters that enter the perturbed Einstein\nequations. We find that while the dark energy perturbations affect the MG\nparameters, the deviations remain smaller than those due to modified gravity\nmodels. Additionally, the deviations due to DE perturbations with a non-zero\neffective sound speed occur at scale ranges that are completely different than\nthose due to some modified gravity models such as the $f(R)$ models. In the\ncase of modified gravity models with zero anisotropic stress at late times, the\nsimultaneous determination of the effective dark energy equation of state and\nthe MG parameters can provide the distinction between these models and DE. The\ngrowth index test was found to be the most robust to these perturbations. The\nscale dependence of the MG parameters in some cases of modified gravity\nconstitute a clear-cut discriminant regardless of any DE perturbations. In\nsummary, we find that the currently proposed cosmological tests to distinguish\nbetween DE and modified gravity are robust to DE perturbations even for extreme\ncases. This is certainly the case even for DE models with equations of state of\nDE that fall well outside of current cosmological constraints.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Nov 2013 15:07:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

In this model, a strong multipole magnetic field near the\nstellar surface for a MSP is assumed and such a field will be close to the\nsurface magnetic fields ($\\sim 10^{11}- 10^{12}$ G) of young ulsars; the outer\ngap of a MSP is controlled by photon-photon pair production process, where the\neffects of magnetic inclination angle ($\\alpha$) and magnetic geometry have\nbeen taken into account, therefore the fractional size of the outer gap is a\nfunction of not only pulsar's period and magnetic field strength but also\nmagnetic inclination angle and radial distance to the neutron star, the inner\nboundary of the outer gap can be estimated by the pair production process of\nthe gamma-ray photons which are produced by the back-flowing particles through\nthe null charge surface; inside the outer gap, a Gaussian distribution of the\nparallel electric field along the trans-field thickness is assumed, and the\ngamma-ray emission is represented by the emission from the average radial\ndistance along the central field lines of the outer gap.

The thermal X-ray emission properties from MSPs are\nalso investigated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Nov 2013 01:19:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-22"}
