Additionally, such demand would result in much\nadverse environmental consequences if the current technology of electric power\ngeneration by predominant fossil fuels continues.

Allowing arbitrary radii but constraining the number\nof disks to be $k$, we present a $4$-approximation algorithm for finding a\npacking in $P$ with $k$ geodesic disks whose minimum radius is maximized. We\nthen turn our focus on \\emph{coverings} of $P$ and present a $2$-approximation\nalgorithm for covering $P$ with $k$ geodesic disks whose maximal radius is\nminimized. Furthermore, we show that all these problems are $\\mathsf{NP}$-hard\nin polygons with holes. Lastly, we present a polynomial time exact algorithm\nwhich covers a polygon with two geodesic disks of minimum maximal radius.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Nov 2013 18:21:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-26"}

In this paper, we\nfocus on a setting where the imaging device allows to sense a fixed set of\nmeasurements. We first discuss the choice of an optimal sampling subspace\n(smallest subset) allowing perfect reconstruction of sparse signals. Its\nstandard design relies on the random drawing of independent measurements. We\ndiscuss how to select the drawing distribution and show that a mixed strategy\ninvolving partial deterministic sampling and independent drawings can help\nbreaking the so-called \"coherence barrier\". Unfortunately, independent random\nsampling is irrelevant for many acquisition devices owing to acquisition\nconstraints. To overcome this limitation, the notion of Variable Density\nSamplers (VDS) is introduced and defined as a stochastic process with a\nprescribed limit empirical measure. It encompasses samplers based on\nindependent measurements or continuous curves. The latter are crucial to extend\nCS results to actual applications. Our main contribution lies in two original\ncontinuous VDS. The first one relies on random walks over the acquisition space\nwhereas the second one is heuristically driven and rests on the approximate\nsolution of a Traveling Salesman Problem.

From our previous works on\nthe identification between the wavefunctions of the five-vertex model and\nGrothendieck polynomials, we introduce skew Grothendieck polynomials, and\nderive the addition theorem among them. Using these relations, we derive the\nwavefunctions of the non-Hermitian phase model as a determinant form which can\nalso be expressed as the Grothendieck polynomials. Namely, we establish a\nK-theoretic boson-fermion correspondence at the level of wavefunctions.

Here, a substrate is reversibly modified by two\nantagonistic enzymes (a \"push-pull\" system) and the fraction in modified state\nundergoes a sharp switching from near-zero to near-unity at a critical value of\nthe ratio of the enzyme concentrations, under saturation conditions. ZOU and\nits extensions have been studied for several decades now, ever since the\nseminal paper of Goldbeter and Koshland (1981); however, a complete\nprobabilistic treatment, important for the study of fluctuations in finite\npopulations, is still lacking. In this paper, we study ZOU using a modular\napproach, akin to the total quasi-steady state approximation (tQSSA). This\napproach leads to a set of Fokker-Planck (drift-diffusion) equations for the\nprobability distributions of the intermediate enzyme-bound complexes, as well\nas the modified/unmodified fractions of substrate molecules. We obtain explicit\nexpressions for various average fractions and their fluctuations in the linear\nnoise approximation (LNA). The emergence of a \"critical point\" for the\nswitching transition is rigorously established. New analytical results are\nderived for the average and variance of the fractional substrate concentration\nin various chemical states in the near-critical regime. For the total fraction\nin the modified state, the variance is shown to be a maximum near the critical\npoint and decays algebraically away from it, similar to a second-order phase\ntransition. The new analytical results are compared with existing ones as well\nas detailed numerical simulations using a Gillespie algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Nov 2013 04:38:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-27"}

Actually, it\nseems a difficult goal to be realistically achieved for a number of reasons.\nFirst, the LT range signature of a Galileo-type satellite is as little as $0.5$\nmm over 3-days arcs, corresponding to a node rate of just $\\dot\\Omega_{\\rm\nLT}=2$ milliarcseconds per year (mas yr$^{-1}$). Some tesseral and sectorial\nocean tides such as $K_1,K_2$ induce long-period harmonic node perturbations\nwith frequencies which are integer multiples of the extremely slow Galileo's\nnode rate $\\dot\\Omega$ completing a full cycle in about 40 yr. Thus, over time\nspans $T$ of some years they would act as superimposed semi-secular aliasing\ntrends. Since the coefficients of the $J_{\\ell}$-free multisatellite linear\ncombinations are determined only by the semimajor axis $a$, the eccentricity\n$e$ and the inclination $I$, which are nominally equal for all the Galileo\nsatellites, it is not possible to include all of them. Even by using only one\nGalileo spacecraft together with the LAGEOS family would be unfeasible because\nthe resulting Galileo coefficient would be $\\gtrsim 1$, thus enhancing the\naliasing impact of the uncancelled non-conservative and tidal perturbations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Nov 2013 12:04:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Jan 2014 16:51:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-21"}

We then\nobtain an order-extensional fully abstract model of PCF by quotienting the\nintensional model by the intrinsic preorder. This is the first\nsyntax-independent description of the fully abstract model for PCF. (Hyland and\nOng have obtained very similar results by a somewhat different route,\nindependently and at the same time).\n  We then consider the effective version of our model, and prove a Universality\nTheorem: every element of the effective extensional model is definable in PCF.\nEquivalently, every recursive strategy is definable up to observational\nequivalence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Nov 2013 14:05:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Jan 2014 12:14:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-21"}

We investigate how the disk's\nself-gravity affects the gap formation process and the migration of the giant\nplanet. Two series of 1-D and 2-D hydrodynamic simulations are performed. We\nselect several surface densities and focus on the gravitationally stable\nregion. To obtain more reliable gravity torques exerted on the planet, a\nrefined treatment of disk's gravity is adopted in the vicinity of the planet.\nOur results indicate that the net effect of the disk's self-gravity on the gap\nformation process depends on the surface density of the disk. We notice that\nthere are two critical values, \\Sigma_I and \\Sigma_II. When the surface density\nof the disk is lower than the first one, \\Sigma_0 < \\Sigma_I, the effect of\nself-gravity suppresses the formation of a gap. When \\Sigma_0 > \\Sigma_I, the\nself-gravity of the gas tends to benefit the gap formation process and enlarge\nthe width/depth of the gap. According to our 1-D and 2-D simulations, we\nestimate the first critical surface density \\Sigma_I \\approx 0.8MMSN. This\neffect increases until the surface density reaches the second critical value\n\\Sigma_II. When \\Sigma_0 > \\Sigma_II, the gravitational turbulence in the disk\nbecomes dominant and the gap formation process is suppressed again. Our 2-D\nsimulations show that this critical surface density is around 3.5MMSN. We also\nstudy the associated orbital evolution of a giant planet. Under the effect of\nthe disk's self-gravity, the migration rate of the giant planet increases when\nthe disk is dominated by gravitational turbulence. We show that the migration\ntimescale associates with the effective viscosity and can be up to 10^4 yr.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Nov 2013 15:15:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}
