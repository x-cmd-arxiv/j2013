The pristine compound is a band\ninsulator with the BiS$_2$ layer, which accommodates electron carriers through\nthe La substitution for Sr, as evidenced by the change in x-ray absorption\nspectra reflecting the occupancy of Bi 6$p$ orbitals. With increasing the\ncarrier density, the resistivity progressively decreases and a bad metallic\nstate appears for $x\\ge0.45$, where bulk superconductivity manifests itself\nbelow approximately 3 K. The value of $T_{\\rm c}$ gradually increases with\ndecreasing $x$ from 0.6 to 0.45 and immediately decreases down to zero at the\ncritical concentration of $x\\sim 0.4$, resulting in an insulator-superconductor\ntransition highly sensitive to the carrier density.

They present near-infrared excess coupled to a flux\ndeficit at about 10 microns and a rising mid-infrared and far-infrared\nspectrum. These features suggest a disk structure with inner and outer dust\ncomponents, separated by a dust-depleted region (or gap). We here report on the\nfirst interferometric observations of the disk around the Herbig Ae star HD\n139614. Its infrared spectrum suggests a flared disk, and presents\npre-transitional features,namely a substantial near-infrared excess accompanied\nby a dip around 6 microns and a rising mid-infrared part. In this framework, we\nperformed a study of the spectral energy distribution (SED) and the\nmid-infrared VLTI/MIDI interferometric data to constrain thespatial structure\nof the inner dust disk region and assess its possibly multi-component\nstructure. We based our work on a temperature-gradient disk model that includes\ndust opacity. While we could not reproduce the SED and interferometric\nvisibilities with a one-component disk, a better agreement was obtained with a\ntwo-component disk model composed of an optically thin inner disk extending\nfrom 0.22 to 2.3 au, a gap, and an outer temperature-gradient disk starting at\n5.6 au. Therefore, our modeling favors an extended and optically thin inner\ndust component and in principle rules out the possibility that the\nnear-infrared excess originates only from a spatially confined region.\nMoreover, the outer disk is characterized by a very steep temperature profile\nand a temperature higher than 300 K at its inner edge.

Most of the effort is devoted to\nthe study of the standard model--like Higgs boson at 126 GeV, however the\nexperimental collaborations at the LHC are also searching for extra scalar\nparticles whose presence may hint to an extended Higgs sector, typical of many\nextensions of the standard model. We study a model independent parametrisation\nof a scalar particle lighter than the 126 GeV Higgs boson, which may be easily\nimplemented in the ongoing searches by ATLAS and CMS. Indeed many effective\nLagrangians/parametrisations used at present for the description of the Higgs\nsector implicitly assume that no light particles other than the standard model\nones are present in the spectrum. We therefore introduce a parametrisation of a\ntwo scalars model, one corresponding to the 126 GeV Higgs boson and the other\nto a lighter scalar. After the introduction of such a tool, we consider two\ntypical examples falling in this category, in order to illustrate the use of\nour formalism: the two Higgs doublet model and the next to minimal\nsupersymmetric standard model. Our results agree with the specific studies\nperformed for these models. Furthermore, employing such a generic\nparametrisation allows us to translate the bounds to any model beyond the\nstandard model falling into this class.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Nov 2013 16:48:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Dec 2013 17:42:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-18"}

The models considered all solve the\ntraditional primitive equations, but employ different numerical algorithms or\ngrids (e.g., pseudospectral and finite volume, with the latter separately in\nlongitude-latitude and `cubed-sphere' grids). The test cases are chosen to\ncleanly address specific aspects of the behaviors typically reported in hot\nextrasolar planet simulations: 1) steady-state, 2) nonlinearly evolving\nbaroclinic wave, and 3) response to fast timescale thermal relaxation. When\ninitialized with a steady jet, all models maintain the steadiness, as they\nshould -- except MITgcm in cubed-sphere grid. A very good agreement is obtained\nfor a baroclinic wave evolving from an initial instability in pseudospectral\nmodels (only). However, exact numerical convergence is still not achieved\nacross the pseudospectral models: amplitudes and phases are observably\ndifferent. When subject to a typical `hot-Jupiter'-like forcing, all five\nmodels show quantitatively different behavior -- although qualitatively\nsimilar, time-variable, quadrupole-dominated flows are produced. Hence, as have\nbeen advocated in several past studies, specific quantitative predictions (such\nas the location of large vortices and hot regions) by GCMs should be viewed\nwith caution.

Based on very general assumptions on the evolution, we have\nmodeled samples of SNRs at various initial and environmental conditions, which\nwere then compared with observed collections of SNRs. In the evolution of SNRs\nthe pressure of the ISM is taken into account, which determines their maximum\nsizes and lifetimes.

In order to extend the coverage area of\nsecondary transmission and reduce the corresponding interference region,\nmulti-hop amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying can be implemented for the\ncommunication between secondary transmitters and receivers. This paper\naddresses the fundamental limits of this promising technique. Specifically, the\neffect of major system parameters on the performance of spectrum-sharing\nmulti-hop AF relaying is investigated. To this end, the optimal transmit power\nallocation at each node along the multi-hop link is firstly addressed. Then,\nthe extreme value theory is exploited to study the limiting distribution\nfunctions of the lower and upper bounds on the end-to-end signal-to-noise ratio\nof the relaying path. Our results disclose that the diversity gain of the\nmulti-hop link is always unity, regardless of the number of relaying hops. On\nthe other hand, the coding gain is proportional to the water level of the\noptimal water-filling power allocation at secondary transmitter and to the\nlarge-scale path-loss ratio of the desired link to the interference link at\neach hop, yet is inversely proportional to the accumulated noise, i.e. the\nproduct of the number of relays and the noise variance, at the destination.\nThese important findings do not only shed light on the performance of the\nsecondary transmissions but also benefit system designers improving the\nefficiency of future spectrum-sharing cooperative systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Nov 2013 19:33:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-22"}

The application\nof quantum data locking in cryptography would allow one to overcome the\nlimitations of the one-time pad encryption, which requires the key to have the\nsame length as the message. However, it is known that the strength of quantum\ndata locking is also its Achilles heel, as the leakage of a few bits of the key\nor the message may in principle allow the eavesdropper to unlock a\ndisproportionate amount of information. In this paper we show that there exist\nquantum data locking schemes that can be made robust against information\nleakage by increasing the length of the shared key by a proportionate amount.\nThis implies that a constant size key can still encrypt an arbitrarily long\nmessage as long as a fraction of it remains secret to the eavesdropper.\nMoreover, we greatly simplify the structure of the protocol by proving that\nphase modulation suffices to generate strong locking schemes, paving the way to\noptical experimental realizations.

The nominal\nefficiency of this radial drift process is in conflict with observations,\nsuggesting that an empirical calibration of solid transport mechanisms in a\ndisk is highly desirable. However, the fact that both radial drift and grain\ngrowth produce a similar particle size segregation in a disk (such that larger\nparticles are preferentially concentrated closer to the star) makes it\ndifficult to disentangle a clear signature of drift alone. We highlight a new\napproach, by showing that radial drift leaves a distinctive \"fingerprint\" in\nthe dust surface density profile that is directly accessible to current\nobservational facilities. Using an analytical framework for dust evolution, we\ndemonstrate that the combined effects of drift and (viscous) gas drag naturally\nproduce a sharp outer edge in the dust distribution (or, equivalently, a sharp\ndecrease in the dust-to-gas mass ratio). This edge feature forms during the\nearliest phase in the evolution of disk solids, before grain growth in the\nouter disk has made much progress, and is preserved over longer timescales when\nboth growth and transport effects are more substantial. The key features of\nthese analytical models are reproduced in detailed numerical simulations, and\nare qualitatively consistent with recent millimeter-wave observations that find\ngas/dust size discrepancies and steep declines in dust continuum emission in\nthe outer regions of protoplanetary disks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Nov 2013 21:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

This paper compares multiple EPS-based merger\ntree algorithms to simulation results using four diagnostics: progenitor mass\nfunction (PMF), mass assembly history (MAH), merger rate per descendant halo,\nand the unevolved subhalo mass function (USMF). In general, algorithms based on\nspherical collapse yield major-merger rates that are too high by a factor of\ntwo, resulting in MAHs that are systematically offset. Assuming ellipsoidal\ncollapse solves most of these issues, but the particular algorithm investigated\nhere that incorporates ellipsoidal collapse dramatically overpredicts the\nminor-merger rate for massive haloes. The only algorithm in our comparison that\nyields MAHs, merger rates, and USMFs in good agreement with simulations, is\nthat by Parkinson et al. (2008). However, this is not a true EPS-based\nalgorithm as it draws its progenitor masses from a PMF calibrated against\nsimulations, rather than `predicted' by EPS. Finally we emphasize that the\nbenchmarks used to test the EPS algorithms are obtained from simulations and\nare hampered by significant uncertainties themselves. In particular, MAHs and\nhalo merger rates obtained from simulations by different authors reveal\ndiscrepancies that easily exceed 50 percent, even when based on the same\nsimulation. Given this status quo, merger trees constructed using the Parkinson\net al. algorithm are as accurate as those extracted from N-body simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Nov 2013 21:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

A common technique for\ncharacterizing the orbital elements of these planets is Markov chain Monte\nCarlo (MCMC), using a Keplerian model with random walk proposals and paired\nwith the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. For approximately a couple of dozen\nplanetary systems with Doppler observations, there are strong planet-planet\ninteractions due to the system being in or near a mean-motion resonance (MMR).\nAn N-body model is often required to accurately describe these systems. Further\ncomputational difficulties arise from exploring a high-dimensional parameter\nspace ($\\sim$7 x number of planets) that can have complex parameter\ncorrelations.

The exquisite timing precision provided by the deep eclipse\nof the white dwarf has revealed complex variations in the eclipse arrival times\nover the last few decades. These variations have been interpreted as the\ninfluence of two planets in orbit around the binary. Recent studies have proved\nthat such a system is dynamically stable over the current lifetime of the\nbinary. However, the existence of such planets is by no means proven and\nseveral alternative mechanisms have been proposed that could drive similar\nvariations. One of these is apsidal precession, which causes the eclipse times\nof eccentric binaries to vary sinusoidally on many year timescales. In this\npaper we present timing data for the secondary eclipse of NN Ser and show that\nthey follow the same trend seen in the primary eclipse times, ruling out\napsidal precession as a possible cause for the variations. This result leaves\nno alternatives to the planetary interpretation for the observed period\nvariations, although we still do not consider their existence as proven. Our\ndata limits the eccentricity of NN Ser to e<0.001. We also detect a 3.3+/-1.0\nsecond delay in the arrival times of the secondary eclipses relative to the\nbest planetary model. This delay is consistent with the expected 2.84+/-0.04\nsecond Romer delay of the binary, and is the first time this effect has been\ndetected in a white dwarf plus M dwarf system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Nov 2013 21:03:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

This paper focuses on\nthe latter problem, i.e. structure formation in a Hubble scale void in the\nlinear regime. This is considerably more complicated than linear perturbations\nof a homogeneous and isotropic background because the inhomogeneous background\nleads to coupling between density perturbations and rotational modes of the\nspacetime geometry, as well as gravitational waves. Previous analyses of this\nproblem ignored this coupling in the hope that the approximation does not\naffect the overall dynamics of structure formation in such models.

The control law maps outputs into inputs and is\noptimized with respect to a cost function, containing physics via the dynamical\nor statistical properties of the attractor to be controlled. Thus, we are\ncapable of exploiting nonlinear mechanisms, e.g. chaos or frequency cross-talk,\nserving the control objective. This optimization is based on genetic\nprogramming, a branch of machine learning. This machine learning control is\nsuccessfully applied to the stabilization of nonlinearly coupled oscillators\nand maximization of Lyapunov exponent of a forced Lorenz system.

This approach can, under\ncertain circumstances, allow such models to be efficiently identified. A major\ncaveat of that work is the assumption of that all elements of the protocol are\nnoise-free. Here, we show that quantum Hamiltonian learning can tolerate\nsubstantial amounts of depolarizing noise and show numerical evidence that it\ncan tolerate noise drawn from other realistic models. We further provide\nevidence that the learning algorithm will find a model that is maximally close\nto the true model in cases where the hypothetical model lacks terms present in\nthe true model. Finally, we also provide numerical evidence that the algorithm\nworks for non-commuting models. This work illustrates that quantum Hamiltonian\nlearning can be performed using realistic resources and suggests that even\nimperfect quantum resources may be valuable for characterizing quantum systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Nov 2013 00:00:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Apr 2014 20:36:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-23"}

To measure learning in physics by high school students,\neither qualitatively or quantitatively, is a process in which it should be\npossible to identify not only the concepts and contents students failed to\nachieve but also the reasons of the failure. We propose that students' video\nproduction offers a very effective formative assessment to teachers: as a\nformative assessment, it produces information that allows the understanding of\nwhere and when the learning process succeeded or failed, of identifying, as a\nsubject or as a group, the defficiencies or misunderstandings related to the\ntheme under analysis and their interpretation by students, and it provides also\na different kind of assessment, related to some other life skills, like the\nability to carry a project to its conclusion and to work cooperatively. In this\npaper, we describe the use of videos produced by high school students as an\nassessment resource. The students were asked to prepare a short video, which\nwas then presented to the whole group and discussed. The videos reveal aspects\nof students' difficulties that usually do not appear in formal assessments such\nas tests and questionnaires. After the use of the videos as an component of\nclassroom assessments and the use of the discussions to rethink learning\nactivities in the group, the videos were analysed and classified in various\ncategories. This analysis showed a strong correlation between the technical\nquality of the video and the content quality of the students argumentation.\nAlso, it was shown that the students don't prepare their video based on quick\nand easy production, they usually choose forms of video production that require\ncareful planning and implementation, and this reflects directly on the overall\nquality of the video and of the learning process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Nov 2013 00:06:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-22"}

For smaller annihilation rates, it can be set by the\nfreeze-in mechanism, also independent of the initial abundance, provided it is\nsmall to begin with. For even smaller interaction rates, the DM decouples while\nbeing non-thermal, and the relic abundance will be essentially set by the\ninitial conditions.

In its simplest\nform, the CS propagates the solution by advecting the `moving cells' along\ntheir characteristic trajectories, and by remapping them on the mesh at the end\nof the time step. The CS is conservative, positivity preserving, simple to\nimplement, and not subject to time step restriction to maintain stability.\nRecently [Y. G\\\"u\\c{c}l\\\"u and W.N.G. Hitchon, 2012] a new methodology was\nintroduced for reducing numerical diffusion, based on a modified equation\nanalysis: the remapping error was compensated by applying small corrections to\nthe final position of the moving cells prior to remapping. While the spatial\naccuracy was increased from 2nd to 4th order, the new scheme retained the\nimportant properties of the original method, and was shown to be simple and\nefficient for constant advection problems. Here the CS is applied to the\nsolution of the Vlasov-Poisson system: the Vlasov equation is split into two\nconstant advection equations, one in configuration space and one in velocity\nspace, and high order time accuracy is achieved by proper composition of the\noperators. The splitting procedure enables us to use the constant advection\nsolver, which we extend to arbitrarily high order of accuracy: a new improved\nprocedure is given, which makes the calculation of the corrections\nstraightforward. Focusing on periodic domains, we describe a spectrally\naccurate scheme based on the fast Fourier transform; the proposed\nimplementation is strictly conservative and positivity preserving. The ability\nto correctly reproduce the system dynamics, as well as resolving small-scale\nfeatures in the solution, is shown in classical 1D-1V test cases, both in the\nlinear and the non-linear regimes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Nov 2013 04:26:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 31 Mar 2014 01:07:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

For\ninstance, if the dealer is part of two \\textsc{qnet}s, say $\\mathcal{Q}_1$ and\n$\\mathcal{Q}_2$ and subsequently finds that $\\mathcal{Q}_2$ is more reliable\nthan $\\mathcal{Q}_1$, the dealer may wish to transfer all her secrets from\n$\\mathcal{Q}_1$ to $\\mathcal{Q}_2$. In this work we address this problem by\ndesigning a protocol that enables the source/dealer to bring back the\ninformation shared in the network, if desired. Unlike classical revocation,\nno-cloning-theorem automatically ensures that the secret is no longer shared in\nthe network.\n  The implications of our results are multi-fold. One interesting implication\nof our technique is the possibility of routing qubits in asynchronous\n\\textsc{qnets}. By asynchrony we mean that the requisite data/resources are\nintermittently available (but not necessarily simultaneously) in the\n\\textsc{qnet}. For example, we show that a source $S$ can send quantum\ninformation to a destination $R$ even though (a) $S$ and $R$ share no quantum\nresource, (b) $R$'s identity is {\\em unknown}\\/ to $S$ initially, (c) $S$\nherself can be $R$ at a later date and/or in a different location to bequeath\nher information and (d) the path chosen for routing the secret may hit a\ndead-end due to resource constraints. Another implication of our technique is\nthe possibility of using {\\em insecure}\\/ resources. For instance, it may\nsafely store its private information with a neighboring organization without\nrevealing data to the host and losing control over retrieving the data.\n  Putting the two implications together, namely routing and secure storage, it\nis possible to envision applications like quantum mail (qmail) as an outsourced\nservice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Nov 2013 12:27:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 19 Sep 2015 11:21:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-23"}

The use\nof SVMs in estimation problems has been traditionally limited to its mere use\nas a black-box model. Noting such limitations in the literature, we take\nadvantage of several properties of Mercer's kernels and functional analysis to\ndevelop a family of SVM methods for estimation in DSP. Three types of signal\nmodel equations are analyzed. First, when a specific time-signal structure is\nassumed to model the underlying system that generated the data, the linear\nsignal model (so called Primal Signal Model formulation) is first stated and\nanalyzed. Then, non-linear versions of the signal structure can be readily\ndeveloped by following two different approaches. On the one hand, the signal\nmodel equation is written in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS) using the\nwell-known RKHS Signal Model formulation, and Mercer's kernels are readily used\nin SVM non-linear algorithms. On the other hand, in the alternative and not so\ncommon Dual Signal Model formulation, a signal expansion is made by using an\nauxiliary signal model equation given by a non-linear regression of each time\ninstant in the observed time series. These building blocks can be used to\ngenerate different novel SVM-based methods for problems of signal estimation,\nand we deal with several of the most important ones in DSP. We illustrate the\nusefulness of this methodology by defining SVM algorithms for linear and\nnon-linear system identification, spectral analysis, nonuniform interpolation,\nsparse deconvolution, and array processing. The performance of the developed\nSVM methods is compared to standard approaches in all these settings. The\nexperimental results illustrate the generality, simplicity, and capabilities of\nthe proposed SVM framework for DSP.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Nov 2013 13:55:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-22"}

Nanostructuration requires the presence of a bock that\nremains miscible in the polymer during polymerization. The selection of the\nmiscible block depends on the particular system and in some cases (e.g., for\nepoxy-amine network based on diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A, and 4,4'-\ndiaminodiphenylsulfone) it is very difficult to find such a block. In this\nmanuscript it is shown that random copolymers of methyl methacrylate (MMA) and\nN,N-dimethylacrylamide (DMA) containing different molar fractions of DMA, can\nbe used as a miscible block for the nanostructuration of epoxies. The\nmiscibility of the random copolymer during formation of the epoxy network was\nfirst analyzed determining cloud-point conversions as a function of the molar\nfraction of DMA in the copolymer. A thermodynamic model of the phase separation\nwas performed using the Flory-Huggins model and taking the polydispersities of\nboth polymers into account. A single expression of the interaction parameter\nbased on the theory of random copolymers provided a reasonable fitting of the\nexperimental cloud-point curves. The significant increase in the miscibility\nproduced by using small DMA molar fractions in the copolymer was explained by\nthe high negative value of the binary interaction energy between DMA and the\nepoxy-amine solvent, associated to the positive value of the interaction energy\nbetween DMA and MMA units. Block copolymers with poly(n-butyl acrylate) as the\nimmiscible block and the random copolymer P(MMA-co-DMA) as the miscible block\nwere used for the nanostructuration of epoxy networks. The necessary molar\nfraction of DMA in the miscible block to stabilize a dispersion of nanosize\ndomains depended on the fraction of the immiscible block.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Nov 2013 15:09:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-22"}

The model takes into account the swelling\nof the organic coronas and the dispersion of particles with swollen coronas in\nthe solvent. The energetic interaction between alkyl chains and solvent is\nconsidered, both within the corona and between the outer alkyl segments and\nfree solvent. Swelling involves mixing of alkanethiol chains and solvent in the\ncorona and stretching of the organic chains. Dispersion considers an entropic\ncontribution based on Carnahan Starling equation of state and an enthalpic term\ncalculated considering the surface contacts between alkyl segments placed in\nthe external boundary of the corona and the molecules of free solvent. Two\ndifferent kinds of phase equilibrium are found. One of them, observed at high\nvalues of the interaction parameter, is the typical liquid-liquid equilibrium\nfor compact NPs in a poor solvent where a complete phase separation is observed\nwhen cooling (increasing the interaction parameter). The second liquid-liquid\nequilibrium is observed at low values of the interaction parameter, where\nswelling of coronas is favored.

For PMMA/BPA-EO blends, a\ndecrease of the entropic contribution to the interaction parameter when\nincreasing the size of the oligodiol was also found. However, the effect was\ncounterbalanced by the opposite contribution of combinatorial terms leading to\ncloud-point curves located in approximately the same temperature range.

Coalescence\nof edges on the FSE's transient leader is observed within the nucleation and is\napproximately characterized by the Lifsthiz-Slyozov growth exponent; (ii) The\nnucleation accelerates and transforms to the condensation process, in the\nsecond phase transition, forming a logarithmically diverging lambda-peak of\nshort-range order parameters at the subsequent critical time - an analogon of\nsuch a transition in superfluidity; (iii) In the third phase transition, the\npeak logarithmically decreases over three quarters of the year, resulting in a\nfew loosely connected sub-graphs. This peak is reminiscent of a non-equilibrium\nsuperstar-like superhub or a `dragon king' effect, abruptly accelerating the\nevolution of the leader company.

The system enhances passive\ncooling of dwellings and can help diminishing power costs for air conditioning\nin summer or in tropical and arid countries. In this work, radiation,\nconvection and conduction heat transfers are investigated. Depending on its\nsurface properties, the screen reflects a large amount of oncoming solar\nradiation. Natural convection in the channel underneath drives off the residual\nheat. The bi-dimensional numerical simulation of the heat transfers through the\ndouble skin reveals the most important parameters for the system's efficiency.\nThey are, by order of importance, the sheet metal surface emissivity, the\nscreen internal and external surface emissivity, the insulation thickness and\nthe inclination angle for a channel width over 6 cm. The influence of those\nparameters on Rayleigh and Nusselt numbers is also investigated. Temperature\nand air velocity profiles on several channel cross-sections are plotted and\ndiscussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Nov 2013 15:29:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-05"}

Autonomous\nweapon systems can be designed and developed to conduct ground, air and naval\noperations. This monograph offers some insights into the challenges of\ndeveloping legal, reliable and ethical forms of autonomous weapons, that\naddress the gap between Police or Law Enforcement and Military operations that\nis growing exponentially small. National adversaries are today in many\ninstances hybrid threats, that manifest criminal and military traits, these\noften require deployment of hybrid-capability autonomous weapons imbued with\nthe capability to taken on both Military and/or Security objectives. The\nWestgate Terrorist Attack of 21st September 2013 in the Westlands suburb of\nNairobi, Kenya is a very clear manifestation of the hybrid combat scenario that\nrequired military response and police investigations against a fighting cell of\nthe Somalia based globally networked Al Shabaab terrorist group.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Nov 2013 16:04:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Jan 2014 09:47:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-28"}

Patients\nusually undergo destruction of substantia nigra to develop typical symptoms\nsuch as resting tremor, hypokinesia, and rigidity. However, the exact mechanism\nof Parkinson disease is still unknown, so it is called idiopathic Parkinsonism.\nAccording to my microarray analysis of peripheral blood leukocytes and\nsubstantia nigra brain tissue, I propose that Parkinson disease is actually a\nTH17 dominant autoimmune disease. Based on the microarray data in substantia\nnigra, HSP40, HSP70, HSP90, HSP27, HSP105, TLR5, TLR7, CEBPB, CEBPG, FOS, and\ncaspase1 are significantly up-regulated. In peripheral leukocytes, NFKB1A,\nCEBPD, FOS, retinoic receptor alpha, suppressor of IKK epsilon, S100A11, G-CSF,\nMMP9, IL-1 receptor, IL-8 receptor, TNF receptor, caspase8, c1q receptor,\ncathepsin Z, HLA-G, complement receptor1, and complement 5a receptor. General\nimmune related genes are also up-regulated including ILF2, CD22, CD3E, BLNK,\nILF3, TCR alpha, TCR zeta, TCR delta, LAT, ITK, Ly9, and BANK1. The autoantigen\nis mainly alpha-synuclein. After knowing the exact disease pathophysiology, we\ncan develop better drugs to prevent or control the detrimental disorder.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Nov 2013 07:31:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-14"}
