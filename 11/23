More precisely, as the symmetry is broken in the transition from the\ncircular disc to the elliptical one, the splitting up of resonances and level\ncrossings are observed. From the mathematical point of view, this observation\ncan be explained by the broken invariance of the continuous symmetry group O(2)\nassociated with the circular disc. The elliptical disc is however invariant\nunder the finite group C2v and the resonances are classified and associated\nwith a given irreducible representation of this group. The main difficulty\narises in the application of the group theory in elastodynamics where the\nvectorial formalism is used to express the physical quantities (elastic\ndisplacement and stress) involved in the boundary conditions. However, this\nmethod significantly simplifies the numerical treatment of the problem which is\nuncoupled over the four irreducible representations of C2v. This provides a\nfull classification of the resonances. They are tagged and tracked as the\neccentricity of the elliptical disc increases. Then, the splitting up of\nresonances, which occurs in the transition from the circular disc to the\nelliptic one, is emphasized. The computation of displacement normal modes also\nhighlights the mode splittings. A physical interpretation of resonances in\nterms of geometrical paths is provided.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Nov 2013 16:39:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

As a result virtual and real\nsingularities cancel at each Born phase space point. The new phase space maps\ncan be used in a traditional approach for NLO calculations. However,\ninteresting applications arise when one instead integrates out the real\nradiation up to a specified scale. This allows one to define NLO weights for\nindividual phase space points that are present at LO. This method allows for\nthe extension of matrix element methods to next-to-leading order, even in the\npresence of jets.

Addressing these challenges requires a thorough\nunderstanding of the traffic and multiplexing characteristics of the different\nrepresentation formats of 3D video. We examine the average bitrate-distortion\n(RD) and bitrate variability-distortion (VD) characteristics of three main\nrepresentation formats. Specifically, we compare multiview video (MV)\nrepresentation and encoding, frame sequential (FS) representation, and\nside-by-side (SBS) representation, whereby conventional single-view encoding is\nemployed for the FS and SBS representations. Our results for long 3D videos in\nfull HD format indicate that the MV representation and encoding achieves the\nhighest RD efficiency, while exhibiting the highest bitrate variabilities. We\nexamine the impact of these bitrate variabilities on network transport through\nextensive statistical multiplexing simulations. We find that when multiplexing\na small number of streams, the MV and FS representations require the same\nbandwidth. However, when multiplexing a large number of streams or smoothing\ntraffic, the MV representation and encoding reduces the bandwidth requirement\nrelative to the FS representation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Nov 2013 18:09:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-25"}

According to the conventional collapse\nscenario, the coherent twin-peak atomic wavefunction in the beams of the\ninterferometer suffers an instantaneous collapse, at infinite speed, when the\natom is captured by one of the two detectors at the ends of the beams, but it\nremains coherent until that instant. In contrast, according to the\nHellwig-Kraus relativistic collapse scenario, the wavefunction collapses at the\nspeed of light, backward in time along the past light cone of each detector.\nThis leads to a premature collapse, or pre-collapse, which for a beam-to-beam\nseparation of 3 m extends over a time span of 10 ns before arrival at the\ndetectors. Within this time span the paired wavepackets in the two beams will\nbe incoherent. The difference between the coherent wavepackets of the\nconventional scenario and the incoherent wavepackets of the relativistic\nscenario can be tested by probing the atomic beams with a transverse laser beam\ncrossing them near the detectors. If the paired atomic wavepackets in the two\nbeams are coherent, the light scattered by the two beams will also be coherent\nand generate a standing light wave in the space between the beams, with\ndetectable interference fringes. If the paired wavepackets are incoherent, no\nsuch interference fringes will be generated, and the distribution of the\nscattered light will be that of two independent dipoles.

Neutrino oscillations have provided indisputable\nevidence in favour of non-zero neutrino masses and mixings. However, the\noriginal formulation of the Standard Model cannot account for these\nobservations, which calls for the introduction of new Physics. Among many\npossibilities, we focus here on the inverse seesaw, a neutrino mass generation\nmechanism in which the Standard Model is extended with fermionic gauge\nsinglets. This model offers an attractive alternative to the usual seesaw\nrealisations since it can potentially have natural Yukawa couplings\n($\\mathcal{O}(1)$) while keeping the new Physics scale at energies within reach\nof the LHC. Among the many possible effects, this scenario can lead to\ndeviations from lepton flavour universality. We have investigated these\nsignatures and found that the ratios $R_K$ and $R_\\pi$ provide new, additional\nconstraints on the inverse seesaw.

This leads to increased rates for\nvarious lepton flavour violating processes, due to enhanced contributions from\npenguin diagrams mediated by the Higgs and $Z^0$ bosons. Finally, we also found\nthat the new invisible decay channels associated with the sterile neutrinos\npresent in the supersymmetric inverse seesaw could significantly weaken the\nconstraints on the mass and couplings of a light CP-odd Higgs boson.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Nov 2013 20:07:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-25"}

For this approach, sufficient\nconditions for the exact recovery of the sparsest solution to the polynomial\nsystem are derived in the noiseless setting, while stable recovery results are\nobtained for the noisy case. Though lacking a similar analysis, the second\napproach provides a more computationally efficient algorithm based on a greedy\nstrategy adding the groups one-by-one. With respect to previous work, the\nproposed methods recover the sparsest solution in a very short computing time\nwhile remaining at least as accurate in terms of the probability of success.\nThis probability is empirically analyzed to emphasize the relationship between\nthe ability of the methods to solve the polynomial system and the sparsity of\nthe solution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Nov 2013 20:29:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Jul 2014 15:47:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-17"}

This regimen has been motivated mostly by radiobiological\nconsiderations, but also provides an approach to reduce normal tissue dose by\nexploiting tumor shrinkage. The paper considers the optimal design of\nmulti-stage treatments, motivated by the clinical management of large liver\ntumors for which normal liver dose constraints prohibit the administration of\nan ablative radiation dose in a single treatment.\n  We introduce a dynamic tumor model that incorporates three factors: radiation\ninduced cell kill, tumor shrinkage, and tumor cell repopulation. The design of\nmulti-stage radiotherapy is formulated as a mathematical optimization problem\nin which the total dose to the liver is minimized, subject to delivering the\nprescribed dose to the tumor. Based on the model, we gain insight into the\noptimal administration of radiation over time, i.e. the optimal treatment gaps\nand dose levels.\n  We analyze treatments consisting of two stages in detail. The analysis\nconfirms the intuition that the second stage should be delivered just before\nthe tumor size reaches a minimum and repopulation overcompensates shrinking.\nFurthermore, it was found that, for a large range of model parameters,\napproximately one third of the dose should be delivered in the first stage. The\nprojected benefit of multi-stage treatments depends on model assumptions.\nHowever, the model predicts large liver dose reductions by more than a factor\nof two for plausible model parameters.\n  The analysis of the tumor model suggests that substantial reduction in normal\ntissue dose can be achieved by exploiting tumor shrinkage via an optimal design\nof multi-stage treatments. This suggests taking a fresh look at multi-stage\nradiotherapy for selected disease sites where substantial tumor regression\ntranslates into reduced target volumes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Nov 2013 20:35:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 9 May 2014 20:41:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

The accretion rates in\nthe two models are \\dot M = 100-200 \\dot M_Edd. These first general\nrelativistic simulations of super-critical black hole accretion are potentially\nrelevant to tidal disruption events and hyper-accreting supermassive black\nholes in the early universe. Both simulated models are optically and\ngeometrically thick, and have funnels through which energy escapes in the form\nof relativistic gas, Poynting flux and radiative flux. The jet is significantly\nmore powerful in the a=0.9 run. The net energy outflow rate in the two runs\ncorrespond to efficiencies of 5% (a=0) and 33% (a=0.9), as measured with\nrespect to the mass accretion rate at the black hole. These efficiencies agree\nwell with those measured in previous simulations of non-radiative geometrically\nthick disks. Furthermore, in the a=0.9 run, the outflow power appears to\noriginate in the spinning black hole, suggesting that the associated physics is\nagain similar in non-radiative and super-critical accretion flows.

Only the part of the tumor with\nhigh tumor cell density can be localized through imaging directly. In contrast,\nbrain tissue infiltrated by tumor cells at low density appears normal on\ncurrent imaging modalities. In clinical practice, a uniform margin is applied\nto account for microscopic spread of disease.\n  The current treatment planning procedure can potentially be improved by\naccounting for the anisotropy of tumor growth: Anatomical barriers such as the\nfalx cerebri represent boundaries for migrating tumor cells. In addition, tumor\ncells primarily spread in white matter and infiltrate gray matter at lower\nrate. We investigate the use of a phenomenological tumor growth model for\ntreatment planning.

On the other side, ionized gas streams outward into the\nmore rarefied environment. This wind is underpressured with respect to the\nneutral gas. The difference in pressure draws in more cloud material, feeding\nthe wind until the densest molecular gas is dissipated.\n  Recent, time-dependent simulations of massive stars turning on within\nmolecular gas show the system evolving in a direction similar to that just\ndescribed.

The vast majority of red galaxies are found to be within three\nvirial radii of a larger galaxy, at the onset of quenching when the specific\nstar formation rate experiences the sharpest decline to fall below\n~10^{-2}-10^{-1}/Gyr (depending on the redshift). We shall thus call this\nmechanism \"environment quenching\", which encompasses satellite quenching. Two\nphysical processes are largely responsible: ram-pressure stripping first\ndisconnects the galaxy from the cold gas supply on large scales, followed by a\nlonger period of cold gas starvation taking place in high velocity dispersion\nenvironment, during the early part of which the existing dense cold gas in the\ncentral region (<10kpc) is consumed by in situ star formation. Quenching is\nfound to be more efficient, but not faster, on average, in denser environment.\nThroughout this quenching period and the ensuing one in the red sequence\ngalaxies follow nearly vertical tracks in the color-stellar-mass diagram. In\ncontrast, individual galaxies of all masses grow most of their stellar masses\nin the blue cloud, prior to the onset of quenching, and progressively more\nmassive blue galaxies with already relatively older mean stellar ages continue\nto enter the red sequence. Consequently, correlations among observables of red\ngalaxies - such as the age-mass relation - are largely inherited from their\nblue progenitors at the onset of quenching.

With\nincreasing J2, we find a Neel phase, a plaquette valence-bond (PVB) phase with\na finite spin gap, and a possible spin liquid in a small region of J2 between\nthese two phases. From the finite-size scaling of the magnetic order parameter,\nwe estimate that the Neel order vanishes at J2/J1~0.44. For 0.5<J2/J1<0.61, we\nfind dimer correlations and PVB textures whose decay lengths grow strongly with\nincreasing system width, consistent with a long-range PVB order in the\ntwo-dimensional limit. The dimer-dimer correlations reveal the s-wave character\nof the PVB order.

The buyer's valuations towards the two items are independent and\nadditive. In this setting, optimal mechanism is unknown for general valuation\ndistributions. We obtain two categories of structural results that shed light\non the optimal mechanisms.\n  The first category of results state that, under certain mild condition, the\noptimal mechanism has a monotone menu.

They are\nnoisy, informal, and surge quickly. Real life events, which may happen and\nevolve every minute, are perceived and circulated in post streams by social\nusers. Intuitively, an event can be viewed as a dense cluster of posts with a\nlife cycle sharing the same descriptive words. There are many previous works on\nevent detection from social streams. However, there has been surprisingly\nlittle work on tracking the evolution patterns of events, e.g., birth/death,\ngrowth/decay, merge/split, which we address in this paper. To define a tracking\nscope, we use a sliding time window, where old posts disappear and new posts\nappear at each moment. Following that, we model a social post stream as an\nevolving network, where each social post is a node, and edges between posts are\nconstructed when the post similarity is above a threshold. We propose a\nframework which summarizes the information in the stream within the current\ntime window as a ``sketch graph'' composed of ``core'' posts. We develop\nincremental update algorithms to handle highly dynamic social streams and track\nevent evolution patterns in real time. Moreover, we visualize events as word\nclouds to aid human perception.

However, it was an open\nquestion whether or not the exact wave equations can admit them in finite water\ndepth. Besides, it was traditionally believed that cusped solitary waves, whose\n1st-derivative tends to infinity at crest, are essentially different from\npeaked solitary ones with finite 1st-derivative. Currently, based on the\nsymmetry and the exact water wave equations, Liao [1] proposed a unified wave\nmodel (UWM) for progressive gravity waves in finite water depth. The UWM admits\nnot only all traditional smooth progressive waves but also the peaked solitary\nwaves in finite water depth: in other words, the peaked solitary progressive\nwaves are consistent with the traditional smooth ones. In this paper, in the\nframe of the linearized UWM, we further give, for the first time, the cusped\nsolitary waves in finite water depth, and besides reveal a close relationship\nbetween the cusped and peaked solitary waves: a cusped solitary wave is consist\nof an infinite number of peaked solitary ones with the same phase speed, so\nthat it can be regarded as a special peaked solitary wave. This also well\nexplains why and how a cuspon has an infinite 1st-derivative at crest. It is\nfound that, like peaked solitary waves, the vertical velocity of a cusped\nsolitary wave in finite water depth is also discontinuous at crest (x=0), and\nespecially its phase speed has nothing to do with wave height, too. In\naddition, it is unnecessary to consider whether the peaked/cusped solitary\nwaves given by the UWM are weak solution or not, since the governing equation\nis not necessary to be satisfied at crest. All of these would deepen and enrich\nour understandings about the cusped solitary waves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Nov 2013 09:50:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 12 Jan 2014 09:58:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-14"}

In an importance sampling\napproach, imposing label switching to the importance function results in an\nexponential increase of the computational cost with the number of components.\nIn this paper, two importance sampling schemes are proposed through choices for\nthe importance function; a MLE proposal and a Rao-Blackwellised importance\nfunction. The second scheme is called dual importance sampling. We demonstrate\nthat this dual importance sampling is a valid estimator of the evidence and\nmoreover show that the statistical efficiency of estimates increases. To reduce\nthe induced high demand in computation, the original importance function is\napproximated but a suitable approximation can produce an estimate with the same\nprecision and with reduced computational workload.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Nov 2013 14:01:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Nov 2014 11:02:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-14"}

To communicate with a computer in a natural way, it will be\ndesirable to use more natural modes of human communication based on voice,\ngestures and facial expressions. In this paper, a holistic approach for facial\nexpression recognition is proposed which captures the variation in facial\nfeatures in temporal domain and classifies the sequence of images in different\nemotions. The proposed method uses Haar-like features to detect face in an\nimage. The dimensionality of the eigenspace is reduced using Principal\nComponent Analysis (PCA). By projecting the subsequent face images into\nprincipal eigen directions, the variation pattern of the obtained weight vector\nis modeled to classify it into different emotions. Owing to the variations of\nexpressions for different people and its intensity, a person specific method\nfor emotion recognition is followed.

This paper addresses some of the\nchallenging issues on brain magnetic resonance (MR) image tumor segmentation\ncaused by the weak correlation between magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\nintensity and anatomical meaning. With the objective of utilizing more\nmeaningful information to improve brain tumor segmentation, an approach which\nemploys bilateral symmetry information as an additional feature for\nsegmentation is proposed. This is motivated by potential performance\nimprovement in the general automatic brain tumor segmentation systems which are\nimportant for many medical and scientific applications\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Nov 2013 08:25:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-24"}
