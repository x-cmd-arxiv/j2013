The emitted radiation are decomposed\ninto different frequency ranges for a temporal correlation analysis between the\nlightcurves in different energy bands. The resulting prompt optical and\ngamma-ray emission show similar temporal profiles, both as a superposition of a\nslow variability component and a fast variability component, except that the\ngamma-ray lightcurve is much more variable than its optical counterpart. The\nvariability features in the simulated lightcurves and the strong correlation\nwith a time lag between the optical and gamma-ray emission are in good\nagreement with the observations of GRB 080319B. Our simulations suggest that\nthe variations seen in the lightcurves stem from the temporal structure of the\nshells injected from the central engine of gamma-ray bursts.

The points are assumed to be\nsampled from some metric space, and the mapping attempts to preserve the\ndistances between each pair of points in the set. Distances in the target space\ncan be computed analytically in this setting. Generalized MDS is an extension\nthat allows mapping one metric space into another, that is, multidimensional\nscaling into target spaces in which distances are evaluated numerically rather\nthan analytically. Here, we propose an efficient approach for computing such\nmappings between surfaces based on their natural spectral decomposition, where\nthe surfaces are treated as sampled metric-spaces. The resulting spectral-GMDS\nprocedure enables efficient embedding by implicitly incorporating smoothness of\nthe mapping into the problem, thereby substantially reducing the complexity\ninvolved in its solution while practically overcoming its non-convex nature.\nThe method is compared to existing techniques that compute dense correspondence\nbetween shapes.

We\nhere confirm the previous spectroscopic redshift and present concordant\nspectroscopic redshifts for an additional eight galaxies. The average of these\nnine redshifts is 1.714 +/- 0.012 (error on mean). Scrutiny of the galaxy\ndistribution in redshift and the plane of the sky shows that there are two\nconcentrations of galaxies near the X-ray source. In addition there are three\ndiffuse X-ray sources spread along the axis connecting the galaxy\nconcentrations. LH146 is one of these three and lies approximately at the\ncenter of the two galaxy concentrations and the outer two diffuse X-ray\nsources. We thus conclude that LH146 is at the redshift initially reported but\nit is not a single virialized galaxy cluster as previously assumed. Rather it\nappears to mark the approximate center of a larger region containing more\nobjects. For brevity we term all these objects and their alignments as large\nscale structure.

So\nfar, only a few observational signatures have been commonly used to claim for\nthe presence of infall. Often these features consist in either\n\"blue-asymmetries\" or absorption at red-shifted velocities (e.g., inverse\nP-Cygni profiles). Both signatures are based only on the shape of the line\nprofile and they do not guarantee by themselves the presence of dominant infall\nmotions. More robust \"mapping signatures\" can be obtained from images that\nangularly resolve the infalling gas. Here we present VLA observations of the\nammonia inversion transitions (2,2), (3,3), (4,4), (5,5), and (6,6) towards the\nhot molecular core (HMC) near G31.41+0.31 that show the signatures of\nprotostellar infall theoretically predicted by Anglada et al. (1991). The\nintensity of the ammonia emission is compact and sharply increases towards the\ncentre in the blue-shifted velocity channel maps, while it shows a more\nflattened distribution in the red-shifted velocity channels. Additionally, the\nemission becomes more compact with increasing (relative) velocity for both red\nand blue-shifted channels. We introduce a new infall signature, the \"central\nblue spot\", easily identifiable in the first-order moment maps. We show that\nrotation produces an additional, independent signature, making the distribution\nof the emission in the channel maps asymmetric with respect to the central\nposition, but without masking the infall signatures. All these mapping\nsignatures, which are identified here for the first time, are present in the\nobserved ammonia transitions of G31 HMC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Nov 2013 20:22:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

Indeed, when\ninertial effects in both liquid streams are negligible, the inner to outer\nflow-rate and viscosity ratios are small enough and the capillary number is\nabove an experimentally determined threshold which is predicted by our\ntheoretical results with small relative errors, a steady micron-sized jet is\nissued from the apex of a conical drop.

The transformation\nalso maps symmetries of the original equations into symmetries of the\ntransformed equations (i.e. preserves the integrability in the sense of the\nsymmetry approach) and acts as a difference substitution for symmetries of a\nspecial form. The latter fact allows us to derive necessary conditions of\nDarboux integrability for the equations defined in the first sentence of the\nabstract.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Nov 2013 02:23:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 2 Dec 2013 23:20:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 28 Apr 2014 14:50:10 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 17 Jun 2014 03:54:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-18"}

In this paper, we study the family of GGMs with small feedback vertex\nsets (FVSs), where an FVS is a set of nodes whose removal breaks all the\ncycles. Exact inference such as computing the marginal distributions and the\npartition function has complexity $O(k^{2}n)$ using message-passing algorithms,\nwhere k is the size of the FVS, and n is the total number of nodes. We propose\nefficient structure learning algorithms for two cases: 1) All nodes are\nobserved, which is useful in modeling social or flight networks where the FVS\nnodes often correspond to a small number of high-degree nodes, or hubs, while\nthe rest of the networks is modeled by a tree. Regardless of the maximum\ndegree, without knowing the full graph structure, we can exactly compute the\nmaximum likelihood estimate in $O(kn^2+n^2\\log n)$ if the FVS is known or in\npolynomial time if the FVS is unknown but has bounded size. 2) The FVS nodes\nare latent variables, where structure learning is equivalent to decomposing a\ninverse covariance matrix (exactly or approximately) into the sum of a\ntree-structured matrix and a low-rank matrix. By incorporating efficient\ninference into the learning steps, we can obtain a learning algorithm using\nalternating low-rank correction with complexity $O(kn^{2}+n^{2}\\log n)$ per\niteration. We also perform experiments using both synthetic data as well as\nreal data of flight delays to demonstrate the modeling capacity with FVSs of\nvarious sizes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Nov 2013 02:39:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-12"}

For small number of bosons, we observe the existence of large number of\nquasi-degenerate states in low-lying excitation which exhibits the Shnirelman\npeak in $P(s)$ distribution. We also find a narrow region of intermediate\nspectrum which can be described by semi-Poisson statistics whereas the higher\nlevels are regular and exhibit Poisson statistics. These observations are\nfurther supported by the analysis of the distribution of the ratio of\nconsecutive level spacings $P(r)$ which is independent of unfolding procedure\nand thereby provides a tool for more transparent comparison with experimental\nfindings than $P(s)$. Thus our detail numerical study clearly shows that the\nvan der Waals clusters become more correlated with the increase in cluster\nsize.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Nov 2013 14:20:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Mar 2014 15:51:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-23"}

To compare a numerical and the\ntheoretical posterior distributions we propose to use Bayes Factors (BF),\nconsidering both of them as models for the data at hand. We prove that the\ntheoretical vs a numerical posterior BF tends to 1, in the same order (of the\nstep size used) as the numerical forward map solver does. For higher order\nsolvers (eg. Runge-Kutta) the Bayes Factor is already nearly 1 for step sizes\nthat would take far less computational effort.

Instead of assuming the existence of these\ntheoretical concepts, we take an alternative route and choose to redefine what\nwe consider to be inertial motion as well as what constitutes an inertial frame\nof reference in flat space-time. We adopt none of the features of our current\ncosmological models except for the requirement that special and general\nrelativity be local approximations within our revised definition of inertial\nsystems. Implicit in our ideas is the assumption that at \"large enough\" scales\none can treat objects within these inertial systems as point-particles having\nan insignificant effect on the curvature of space-time. We then proceed under\nthe assumption that time and space are fundamentally intertwined such that\ntime- and spatial-translational invariance are not inherent symmetries of flat\nspace-time (i.e. observable clock rates depend upon both relative velocity and\nspatial position within these inertial systems) and take the geodesics of this\ntheory in the radial Rindler chart as the proper characterization of inertial\nmotion. With this commitment, we are able to model solely with inertial motion\nthe observed effects expected to be the result of `dark energy', `dark matter',\nand `dark flow'. In addition, we examine the potential observable implications\nof our theory in a gravitational system located within a confined region of an\ninertial reference frame, subsequently interpreting the Pioneer anomaly as\nsupport for our redefinition of inertial motion. As well, we extend our\nanalysis into quantum mechanics by quantizing for a real scalar field and find\na possible explanation for the asymmetry between matter and antimatter within\nthe framework of these redefined inertial systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Nov 2013 03:23:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 3 Jan 2014 20:48:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-06"}
