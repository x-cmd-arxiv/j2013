However, solid mathematical foundations for\ninformation-theoretic analysis of molecular communication have not yet been\nbuilt. In particular, no one has ever proven that the channel coding theorem\napplies for molecular communication, and no relationship between information\nrate capacity (maximum mutual information) and code rate capacity (supremum\nachievable code rate) has been established. In this paper, we focus on a major\nsubclass of molecular communication - the diffusion-based molecular\ncommunication. We provide solid mathematical foundations for information theory\nin diffusion-based molecular communication by creating a general\ndiffusion-based molecular channel model in measure-theoretic form and prove its\nchannel coding theorems. Various equivalence relationships between statistical\nand operational definitions of channel capacity are also established, including\nthe most classic information rate capacity and code rate capacity. As\nbyproducts, we have shown that the diffusion-based molecular channel is with\n\"asymptotically decreasing input memory and anticipation\" and \"d-continuous\".\nOther properties of diffusion-based molecular channel such as stationarity or\nergodicity are also proven.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Nov 2013 16:05:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-19"}

Our results indicate that compared to successful populations\nwithout Allee effect, successful Allee-effect populations tend to 1) derive\nfrom larger founder population sizes and thus have a higher initial amount of\ngenetic variation, 2) spend fewer generations at small population sizes where\ngenetic drift is particularly strong, and 3) spend more time around the\ncritical population size and thus experience more drift there.

In the case of multiple introduction\nevents, there is an additional increase in diversity because Allee-effect\npopulations tend to derive from a larger number of introduction events than\nother populations. Finally, we show that given genetic data from sufficiently\nmany populations, we can statistically infer the critical population size.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Nov 2013 17:36:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 22 Nov 2013 10:08:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-25"}

An\neffective approach which recently drew a considerable attention in the research\ncommunity is to reweight the training samples to minimize that discrepancy. In\nspecific, many methods are based on developing Density-ratio (DR) estimation\ntechniques that apply to both regression and classification problems. Although\nthese methods work well for regression problems, their performance on\nclassification problems is not satisfactory. This is due to a key observation\nthat these methods focus on matching the sample marginal distributions without\npaying attention to preserving the separation between classes in the reweighted\nspace. In this paper, we propose a novel method for Discriminative\nDensity-ratio (DDR) estimation that addresses the aforementioned problem and\naims at estimating the density-ratio of joint distributions in a class-wise\nmanner. The proposed algorithm is an iterative procedure that alternates\nbetween estimating the class information for the test data and estimating new\ndensity ratio for each class. To incorporate the estimated class information of\nthe test data, a soft matching technique is proposed. In addition, we employ an\neffective criterion which adopts mutual information as an indicator to stop the\niterative procedure while resulting in a decision boundary that lies in a\nsparse region.

The main result of this work is the\nproof that the energy of the Einstein-equivariant wave map system does not\nconcentrate during the Cauchy evolution. A key ingredient in the proof is the\nuse of the fact that geometric mass at infinity of the Einstein-equivariant\nwave map system is conserved during the evolution. However, this observation\nhas some subtle local implications which have been used to estimate the energy\nlocally. For instance, we construct a divergence-free vector field which gives\nmonotonicity of energy in the past null cone of any point. In addition, this\nvector has also been used to prove that the energy does not concentrate away\nfrom the axis of the domain manifold. Later, estimating the divergence of a\nMorawetz vector on a truncated past null cone, we prove that the kinetic energy\ndoes not concentrate. Finally, assuming that the target manifold satisfies the\nGrillakis condition, we proceed to prove the non-concentration of energy for\nthe critical Einstein-equivariant wave map system. Keeping track of various\nquantities of wave map relative to the evolving null geometry of the background\nmanifold is a recurring theme throughout the course of this work.\n  Apart from a purely mathematical interest, the motivation to study critical\nself-gravitating wave maps is that they occur naturally in 3+1 Einstein's\nequations of general relativity. Therefore, studying critical self-gravitating\nwave maps could be a fruitful way of understanding the ever elusive global\nbehaviour of Einstein's equations. This work is a step in this endeavour.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Nov 2013 19:09:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-19"}

Diffusion of transcription factors can increase noise in\ngene expression, while diffusion of proteins between intracellular compartments\nor between cells can reduce concentration fluctuations. In push-pull networks\ndiffusion can impede information transmission, while in multi-site protein\nmodification networks diffusion can qualitatively change the macroscopic\nresponse of the system, such as the loss or emergence of bistability. Moreover,\ndiffusion can directly change the metabolic flux. We describe how crowding\naffects diffusion, and thus how all these phenomena are influenced by crowding.\nYet, a potentially more important effect of crowding on biochemical networks is\nmediated via the shift in the equilibria of bimolecular reactions, and we\nprovide computational evidence that supports this idea.

With $SU (N)$\nChan-Paton factors, the sum over planar open string multi-loop diagrams\ndescribes the 't Hooft limit $N\\to \\infty$ with $Ng_s^2$ held fixed. By\nincluding only planar diagrams in the sum the usual mechanism for the\ncancellation of loop divergences (which occurs, for example, among the planar\nand M\\\"obius strip diagrams by choosing a specific gauge group) is not\navailable and a renormalization procedure is needed. In this article the\nrenormalization is achieved by suspending total momentum conservation by an\namount $p\\equiv \\sum_i^n k_i\\neq 0$ at the level of the integrands in the\nintegrals over the moduli and analytically continuing them to $p=0$ at the very\nend. This procedure has been successfully tested for the 2 and 3 gluon planar\nloop amplitudes by Thorn. Gauge invariance is respected and the correct running\nof the coupling in the limiting gauge field theory was also correctly obtained.\nIn this article we extend those results in two directions. First, we generalize\nthe renormalization method to an arbitrary $n$-gluon planar loop amplitude\ngiving full details for the 4-point case. One of our main results is to provide\na fully renormalized amplitude which is free of both UV and the usual spurious\ndivergences leaving only the physical singularities in it. Second, using the\ncomplete renormalized amplitude, we extract the high-energy scattering regime\nat fixed angle (tensionless limit).

The dependence of the magnetic phenomena on the\nelectron density or gate voltage stems from competing magnetic interactions\nbetween the local moments and the different conduction bands. At low densities\nonly the lowest conduction band, composed of the $d_{xy}$ orbitals of Ti, is\noccupied.

Our results are consistent with ULXs in\nearly-type galaxies probing the luminous tail of the low-mass X-ray binary\npopulation, and are briefly discussed in context of the influence of\ngravitational interactions on the long-term evolution of a galaxy's (older)\nstellar population.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Nov 2013 21:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

Additionally, the GRB rate at\nhigh redshift provides a strong probe of star formation history in the early\nuniverse. While hundreds of GRBs are observed by Swift, it remains difficult to\ndetermine the intrinsic GRB rate due to the complex trigger algorithm of Swift.\nCurrent studies of the GRB rate usually approximate the Swift trigger algorithm\nby a single detection threshold. However, unlike the previously flown GRB\ninstruments, Swift has over 500 trigger criteria based on photon count rate and\nadditional image threshold for localization. To investigate possible systematic\nbiases and explore the intrinsic GRB properties, we develop a program that is\ncapable of simulating all the rate trigger criteria and mimicking the image\nthreshold. Our simulations show that adopting the complex trigger algorithm of\nSwift increases the detection rate of dim bursts. As a result, our simulations\nsuggest bursts need to be dimmer than previously expected to avoid\nover-producing the number of detections and to match with Swift observations.\nMoreover, our results indicate that these dim bursts are more likely to be high\nredshift events than low-luminosity GRBs. This would imply an even higher\ncosmic GRB rate at large redshifts than previous expectations based on\nstar-formation rate measurements, unless other factors, such as the luminosity\nevolution, are taken into account. The GRB rate from our best result gives a\ntotal number of 4571^{+829}_{-1584} GRBs per year that are beamed toward us in\nthe whole universe.\n  SPECIAL NOTE (2015.05.16): This new version incorporates an erratum.

Stellar clusters in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) are useful\nprobes for studying the chemical and dynamical evolution of this neighbouring\ndwarf galaxy, enabling inspection of a large period covering over 10 Gyr. Aims:\nThe main goals of this work are the derivation of age, metallicity, distance\nmodulus, reddening, core radius, and central density profiles for six sample\nclusters, in order to place them in the context of the Small Cloud evolution.\nThe studied clusters are AM 3, HW 1, HW 34, HW 40, Lindsay 2, and Lindsay 3; HW\n1, HW 34, and Lindsay 2 are studied for the first time. Methods: Optical\ncolour-magnitude diagrams (V,B - V CMDs) and radial density profiles were built\nfrom images obtained with the 4.1 m Southern Astrophysical Research (SOAR)\ntelescope, reaching V ~ 23. The determination of structural parameters were\ncarried out by applying King profile fitting. The other parameters were derived\nin a self-consistent way by means of isochrone fitting, which uses likelihood\nstatistics to identify the synthetic CMDs that best reproduce the observed\nones. Membership probabilities were determined comparing the cluster and\ncontrol field CMDs. Completeness and photometric uncertainties were obtained by\nperforming artificial star tests. Results: The results confirm that these\nclusters (except HW 34, identified as a field fluctuation) are intermediate-age\nclusters, with ages between 1.2 Gyr (Lindsay 3) and ~5.0 Gyr (HW 1). In\nparticular HW 1, Lindsay 2 and Lindsay 3 are located in a region that we called\nWest Halo, where studies of ages and metallicity gradients are still lacking.\nMoreover, Lindsay 2 was identified as a moderately metal-poor cluster with\n[Fe/H] = -1.4 +/- 0.2 dex, lower than expected from the age-metallicity\nrelation by Pagel & Tautvaisiene (1998). We also found distances varying from\n~53 kpc to 66 kpc, compatible with the large depth of the SMC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Nov 2013 22:43:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Jul 2014 21:08:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-17"}

In this model the\ninterface is represented by a continuous distribution of springs which\nsimulates the presence of a thin elastic layer. The constitutive law for the\ncontinuous distribution of normal and tangential of initially linear elastic\nsprings takes into account possible frictionless elastic contact between fibre\nand matrix once a portion of the interface is broken. A brittle failure\ncriterion is employed for the distribution of springs, which enables the study\nof crack onset and propagation. This interface failure criterion takes into\naccount the variation of the interface fracture toughness with the fracture\nmode mixity.

As the LSPR behavior of gold nanostructures (Au\nNPs) on the top of a gold thin film is exquisitely sensitive to the spacer\ndistance of the film-Au NPs, we investigate in the present work the influence\nof a few-layered graphene spacer on the LSPR behavior of the NPs. The idea is\nto evidence the role of few-layered graphene as one of the thinnest possible\nspacer. We first show that the coupling to the Au film induces a strong\nlowering at around 507nm and sharpening of the main LSPR of the Au NPs.\nMoreover, a blue shift in the main LSP resonance of about 13 nm is observed in\nthe presence of a few-layered graphene spacer when compared to the case where\ngold nanostructures are directly linked to a gold thin film. Numerical\nsimulations suggest that this LSP mode is dipolar and that the hot spots of the\nelectric field are pushed to the top corners of the NPs, which makes it very\nsensitive to surrounding medium optical index changes and thus appealing for\nsensing applications. A figure of merit (FoM) of such a system (gold/graphene/\nAu NPs) is 2.8, as compared to 2.1 for gold/Au NPs either a 33% sensitivity\ngain and opens up new sensing strategies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Nov 2013 07:08:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-20"}

The semantic information in web documents and\nqueries cannot be effectively represented, leading to information lost or\nmisunderstanding so that the results are either unreliable or inconsistent. A\nnew qualitative approach is thus proposed for supporting geographic information\nretrieval based on qualitative representation, semantic matching, and\nqualitative reasoning. A qualitative representation model and the corresponding\nsimilarity measurement method are defined. Information in documents and user\nqueries are represented using propositional logic, which considers the thematic\nand geographic semantics synthetically. Thematic information is represented as\nthematic propositions on the base of domain ontology. Similarly, spatial\ninformation is represented as geo-spatial propositions with the support of\ngeographic knowledge base. Then the similarity is divided into thematic\nsimilarity and spatial similarity. The former is calculated by the weighted\ndistance of proposition keywords in the domain ontology, and the latter\nsimilarity is further divided into conceptual similarity and spatial\nsimilarity. Represented by propositions and information units, the similarity\nmeasurement can take evidence theory and fuzzy logic to combine all sub\nsimilarities to get the final similarity between documents and queries. This\nnovel retrieval method is mainly used to retrieve the qualitative geographic\ninformation to support the semantic matching and results ranking.

The\nbackprojection-filtration (BPF) algorithm could reduce radiation dose by\nreconstructing images from truncated data in a short scan. In dental CT, it\ncould reduce radiation dose for the teeth by using the projection acquired in a\nshort scan, and could avoid irradiation to other part by using truncated\nprojection. However, the limit of integration for backprojection varies per\nPI-line, resulting in low calculation efficiency and poor parallel performance.\nRecently, a tent BPF (T-BPF) has been proposed to improve calculation\nefficiency by rearranging projection. However, the memory-consuming data\nrebinning process is included. Accordingly, the chose-BPF (C-BPF) algorithm is\nproposed in this paper. In this algorithm, the derivative of projection is\nbackprojected to the points whose x coordinate is less than that of the source\nfocal spot to obtain the differentiated backprojection (DBP). The finite\nHilbert inverse is then applied to each PI-line segment. C-BPF avoids the\ninfluence of the variable limit of integration by selective backprojection\nwithout additional time cost or memory cost. The simulation experiment and the\nreal experiment demonstrated the higher reconstruction efficiency of C-BPF.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Nov 2013 09:03:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-20"}

Systems\ncoupled to the environment lose quantum coherence quickly and realization of\nschemes based on unitarity might be impossible. Recent discovery of room\ntemperature quantum coherence in light harvesting complexes opens up new\npossibilities to borrow concepts from biology to use quantum effects for\ncomputational purposes. While it has been conjectured that light harvesting\ncomplexes such as the Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) complex in the green sulfur\nbacteria performs an efficient quantum search similar to the quantum Grover's\nalgorithm the analogy has yet to be established.\n  In this work we show that quantum dissipation plays an essential role in the\nquantum search performed in the FMO complex and it is fundamentally different\nfrom known algorithms. In the FMO complex not just the optimal level of phase\nbreaking is present to avoid both quantum localization and Zeno trapping but it\ncan harness quantum dissipation as well to speed the process even further up.\nWith detailed quantum calculations taking into account both phase breaking and\nquantum dissipation we show that the design of the FMO complex has been\nevolutionarily optimized and works faster than pure quantum or\nclassical-stochastic algorithms. Inspired by the findings we introduce a new\ncomputational concept based on decoherent quantum evolution.

We used a\nwell-established free Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) code, DS2V. At very\nhigh upstream densities (~1020 molecules/m3 and above) the flow into the pump\nis choked. Enlarging the aperture is the only way to increase the pumping speed\nat high densities. Ninety percent of the deuterium and tritium is successfully\ntrapped at 15 K (assuming that the sticking coefficient is 80-100% on the 15-22\nK surface). On the other hand, the remaining 10% still exceeds the small amount\nof helium in the gas input.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Nov 2013 10:56:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-28"}

Since the beam is intrinsically narrow (~1 deg), the associated\nemission region must be small for the observed BEC to avoid smearing out by\nspatial convolution. We estimate whether the energy available in the stream is\nsufficient to produce such a bright feature in the averaged profile. The energy\nconsiderations become complicated by the angular constraints imposed by the\nwidth of the microbeam, and by the specific spectrum of the BEC which is found\nto have the spectral index xi ~ -0.9 in comparison to the index of xi ~ -2 for\nthe total profile. For typical parameters, the luminosity of the BEC is\ndetermined to be 4 10^{25} erg/s, whereas the maximum-possible\nbeam-size-limited power of the stream is L_max ~ 2 10^{29} erg/s. This implies\nthe minimum energy-conversion efficiency of eta ~ 2 10^{-4}. The BEC's\nluminosity does not exceed any absolute limits of energetics, in particular, it\nis smaller than the power of primary electron and/or secondary plasma stream.\nHowever, the implied efficiency of energy transfer into the radio band is\nextreme if the coherently emitting charge-separated plasma density is limited\nto the Goldreich-Julian value. This suggests that the bifurcated shape of the\nBEC has macroscopic origin, however, several uncertainties (eg. the dipole\ninclination and spectral shape) make this conclusion not firm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Nov 2013 13:59:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

It\nis believed that the use or otherwise of FM is adaptive to the acoustic\nenvironment, and also that there are specific social uses of FM such as trills\nin aggressive territorial encounters. Yet temporal fine detail of FM is often\nabsent or obscured in standard audio signal analysis methods such as Fourier\nanalysis or linear prediction. Hence it is important to consider high\nresolution signal processing techniques for analysis of FM in bird\nvocalisations. If such methods can be applied at big data scales, this offers a\nfurther advantage as large datasets become available.\n  We introduce methods from the signal processing literature which can go\nbeyond spectrogram representations to analyse the fine modulations present in a\nsignal at very short timescales. Focusing primarily on the genus Phylloscopus,\nwe investigate which of a set of four analysis methods most strongly captures\nthe species signal encoded in birdsong. In order to find tools useful in\npractical analysis of large databases, we also study the computational time\ntaken by the methods, and their robustness to additive noise and MP3\ncompression.\n  We find three methods which can robustly represent species-correlated FM\nattributes, and that the simplest method tested also appears to perform the\nbest. We find that features representing the extremes of FM encode species\nidentity supplementary to that captured in frequency features, whereas\nbandwidth features do not encode additional information.\n  Large-scale FM analysis can efficiently extract information useful for\nbioacoustic studies, in addition to measures more commonly used to characterise\nvocalisations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Nov 2013 15:02:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-22"}

In fact, what drives\nthe financial market and what pattern financial time series follows have long\nbeen the interest that attracts economists, mathematicians and most recently\ncomputer scientists [17]. This paper gives an idea about the trend analysis of\nstock market behaviour using Hidden Markov Model (HMM). The trend once followed\nover a particular period will sure repeat in future. The one day difference in\nclose value of stocks for a certain period is found and its corresponding\nsteady state probability distribution values are determined. The pattern of the\nstock market behaviour is then decided based on these probability values for a\nparticular time. The goal is to figure out the hidden state sequence given the\nobservation sequence so that the trend can be analyzed using the steady state\nprobability distribution( ) values. Six optimal hidden state sequences are\ngenerated and compared. The one day difference in close value when considered\nis found to give the best optimum state sequence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Nov 2013 15:12:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-20"}

In addition, we\nassume the presence of two types of magnetic fluxes: a flux running along the\ncosmic string and another enclosed by the compact dimension. These fluxes give\nrise to Aharanov-Bohm-like effects on the VEVs. The VEVs are decomposed into\ntwo parts corresponding to the geometry of a straight cosmic string without\ncompactification plus a topological part induced by the compactification of the\nstring axis. Both contributions are even periodic functions of the magnetic\nfluxes with period equal to the flux quantum. The vacuum energy density is\nequal to the radial stress for the parts corresponding to the straight cosmic\nstring and the topological one. Moreover, the axial stress is equal to the\nenergy density for the parts corresponding to the straight cosmic string;\nhowever, for massive fermionic field this does not occur for the topological\ncontributions. With respect to the dependence on the magnetic fluxes, both, the\nfermionic condensate and the vacuum energy density, can be either positive or\nnegative. Moreover, for points near the string, the main contribution to the\nVEVs comes from the straight cosmic string part, whereas at large distances the\ntopological ones dominate. In addition to the local characteristics of the\nvacuum state, we also evaluate the part in the topological Casimir energy\ninduced by the string.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Nov 2013 08:42:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-28"}

In\nchannel-out networks, pathways are not only formed a posteriori, but they are\nalso actively selected according to the inference outputs from the lower\nlayers. From a mathematical perspective, channel-out networks can represent a\nwider class of piece-wise continuous functions, thereby endowing the network\nwith more expressive power than that of maxout networks.
