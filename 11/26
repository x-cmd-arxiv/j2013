As expected, strong correlations between the\nSN Ia light-curve width (stretch) and the host age/mass/metallicity are found:\nfainter, faster-declining events tend to be hosted by older/massive/metal-rich\ngalaxies. There is some evidence that redder SNe Ia explode in higher\nmetallicity galaxies, but we found no relation between the SN colour and host\ngalaxy extinction based on the Balmer decrement, suggesting that the colour\nvariation of these SNe does not primarily arise from this source. SNe Ia in\nhigher-mass/metallicity galaxies also appear brighter after stretch/colour\ncorrections than their counterparts in lower mass hosts, and the stronger\ncorrelation is with gas-phase metallicity suggesting this may be the more\nimportant variable. We also compared the host stellar mass distribution to that\nin galaxy targeted SN surveys and the high-redshift untargeted Supernova Legacy\nSurvey (SNLS). SNLS has many more low mass galaxies, while the targeted\nsearches have fewer. This can be explained by an evolution in the galaxy\nstellar mass function, coupled with a SN delay-time distribution proportional\nto $t^{-1}$. Finally, we found no significant difference in the\nmass--metallicity relation of our SN Ia hosts compared to field galaxies,\nsuggesting any metallicity effect on the SN Ia rate is small.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Nov 2013 16:00:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

Compared to the standard inflationary power spectrum,\nintermediate to small scales would experience further substantial matter\nclustering, were a cosmological magnetic field present prior to recombination.\nAs a consequence, the bias and redshift distribution of galaxies would also be\nmodified. Hitherto, primordial magnetic fields (PMFs) have been tested and\nconstrained with a number of cosmological observables, e.g. the cosmic\nmicrowave background radiation, galaxy clustering and, more recently, weak\ngravitational lensing. Here, we explore the constraining potential of the\ndensity fluctuation bias induced by gravitational lensing magnification onto\nthe galaxy-galaxy angular power spectrum. Such an effect is known as\nmagnification bias. Compared to the usual galaxy clustering approach,\nmagnification bias helps in lifting the pathological degeneracy present amongst\npower spectrum normalisation and galaxy bias. This is because magnification\nbias cross-correlates galaxy number density fluctuations of nearby objects with\nweak lensing distortions of high-redshift sources. Thus, it takes advantage of\nthe gravitational deflection of light, which is insensitive to galaxy bias but\npowerful in constraining the density fluctuation amplitude. To scrutinise the\npotentiality of this method, we adopt a deep and wide-field spectroscopic\ngalaxy survey.

Then we\nintroduce the smooth singular simplicial set $S^D(X)$ associated to a\ndiffeological space $X$, and show that when $S^D(X)$ is fibrant, it captures\nsmooth homotopical properties of $X$. Motivated by this, we define $X$ to be\nfibrant when $S^D(X)$ is, and more generally define cofibrations, fibrations\nand weak equivalences in the category of diffeological spaces using the smooth\nsingular simplicial set functor. We conjecture that these form a model category\nstructure, but in this paper we assume little prior knowledge of model\ncategories, and instead focus on concrete questions about smooth manifolds and\ndiffeological spaces. We prove that our setup generalizes the naive smooth\nhomotopy theory of smooth manifolds by showing that a smooth manifold without\nboundary is fibrant and that for fibrant diffeological spaces, the weak\nequivalences can be detected using ordinary smooth homotopy groups.

PIV\ndata is limited in spatial resolution and sample length. The influence of\ntruncation of both spatial resolution and frequency resolution is investigated,\nas well as the influences of spatial filtering and measurement noise.

This form of non-cancellation is investigated for spacetime geometry\nfluctuations driven by the vacuum stress tensor fluctuations of the\nelectromagnetic field. The time dependence can take the form of sinusoidal\nconformal metric perturbations or of time variation of the gravitational\nconstant, both of which can arise from modifications of the gravitational\naction. We examine two observable quantities, luminosity fluctuations and\nredshift fluctuations, both of which can arise from stress tensor fluctuations.\nWe find that both quantities can grow with increasing distance between a source\nand an observer.

They satisfy Eulerian-type\nhydrodynamics with coupling by self-consistent electric and magnetic fields.\nEvery solution of the VMD is an exact solution of the original Vlasov equation.\nWe show convergence of the VMD Langmuir wave dispersion relation in thermal\nplasma to that of Vlasov-Landau as $N$ increases. Rotational symmetry about the\n$z$ axis in $3D$ of small perpendicular wavenumber Langmuir fluctuations is\ndemonstrated for $N\\geq 6$, with flows arranged uniformly over the azimuthal\nangle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Nov 2013 20:26:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

From the\nlatter, we select other two subsamples: isolated centrals and bright field\ncentrals, both with the same magnitude limit. The stellar mass (Ms)\ndistributions of the field and group central galaxies are different, which\nexplains why in general the field central galaxies are mainly located in the\nblue cloud/star forming regions, whereas the group central galaxies are\nstrongly biased to the red sequence/passive regions.

For systems without satellites, the Ms-Mh relation\nsteepens at high halo masses compared to group centrals, which is a consequence\nof assuming a one-to-one relation between group total stellar mass and halo\nmass.

The uncertainty in the\nparameters of the model and their effect on a population can be tested in a\nstatistical way, which then leads to a deeper understanding of the underlying\nphysical processes involved. To understand the predictive power of BPS codes,\nwe study the similarities and differences in the predicted populations of four\ndifferent BPS codes for low- and intermediate-mass binaries. We investigate\nwhether the differences are caused by different assumptions made in the BPS\ncodes or by numerical effects. To simplify the complex problem of comparing BPS\ncodes, we equalise the inherent assumptions as much as possible. We find that\nthe simulated populations are similar between the codes. Regarding the\npopulation of binaries with one WD, there is very good agreement between the\nphysical characteristics, the evolutionary channels that lead to the birth of\nthese systems, and their birthrates. Regarding the double WD population, there\nis a good agreement on which evolutionary channels exist to create double WDs\nand a rough agreement on the characteristics of the double WD population.\nRegarding which progenitor systems lead to a single and double WD system and\nwhich systems do not, the four codes agree well.

To date, the best known case of a binary merger is the V1309 Sco\noutburst, where the orbital period was known and observed to decay up to the\noutburst. Using the hydrodynamical code StarSmasher, we study in detail which\ncharacteristics of the progenitor binary affect the outburst and produce the\nbest match with observations. We have developed a set of tools in order to\nquantify any common envelope event. We consider binaries consisting of a\n1.52$M_\\odot$ giant and a 0.16$M_\\odot$ companion with $P_{\\rm orb}\\sim1.4$\ndays, varying the nature of the companion and its synchronization. We show that\nall considered progenitor binaries evolve towards the merger primarily due to\nthe Darwin instability. The merger is accompanied by mass ejection that\nproceeds in several separate mass outbursts and takes away a few percent of the\ndonor mass. This very small mass, nonetheless, is important as it is not only\nsufficient to explain the observed light-curve, but it also carries away up to\n1/3 of the both initial total angular momentum and initial orbital energy. We\nfind that all synchronized systems experience $L_2$ mass loss that operates\nduring just a few days prior to merger and produces ring-shaped ejecta. The\nformed star is always a strongly heated radiative star that differentially\nrotates. We conclude that the case of a synchronized binary with a\nmain-sequence companion gives the best match with observations of V1309 Sco.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Nov 2013 00:15:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Apr 2014 19:19:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-17"}

The latter factors are of considerable interest but\nit has been difficult to accurately study them. For example, videos uploaded by\nusers with large social networks may tend to be more popular because they tend\nto have more interesting content, not because social network size has a\nsubstantial direct impact on popularity. In this paper, we develop and apply a\nmethodology that is able to accurately assess, both qualitatively and\nquantitatively, the impacts of various content-agnostic factors on video\npopularity.

We analyze a number of phenomena that may contribute\nto rich-get-richer, including the first-mover advantage, and search bias\ntowards popular videos. For young videos we find that factors other than the\ntotal number of previous views, such as uploader characteristics and number of\nkeywords, become relatively more important.

A first answer, by Hojman,\nKucha\\v{r} and Teitelboim, is that using embeddability into spacetime as a\nprinciple gives the form of ${\\cal H}$. The present paper culminates a second\nMachian answer - initially by Barbour, Foster and \\'{o} Murchadha - in which\nspace but not spacetime are assumed. Thus this answer is additionally a\nclassical-level resolution of the spacetime reconstruction problem. In this\napproach, mere consistency imposed by the Dirac procedure whittles down a\ngeneral ansatz to one of four alternatives: Lorentzian, Galilean, or Carrollian\nrelativity, or constant mean curvature slicing. These arise together as the\ndifferent ways to kill off a 4-factor obstruction term. It is novel for such an\nalternative to arise from principles of dynamics considerations (in contrast\nwith the historical form of the dichotomy between universal local Galilean or\nLorentzian relativity). It is furthermore intriguing that it gives constant\nmean curvature slicing - familiar from York's work on the initial value problem\n-- as a further option on a similar footing. That is related to a number of\nrecent alternative theories/formulations of GR known collectively as `shape\ndynamics'. The original work did not treat this with Poisson brackets and a\nproper systematic Dirac-type analysis; we rectify this in this paper. It is\nalso the first demonstration of how this approach solves the classical\nspacetime reconstruction problem via `hypersurface tensor dual nationality' and\nwhat can be interpreted as embedding equations arising.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Nov 2013 01:52:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 Feb 2014 01:26:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-04"}

In this paper, we first present a trust vector\nconsisting of three values for Contextual Transaction Trust (CTT). In the\ncomputation of three CTT values, the identified three important context\ndimensions, including product category, transaction amount and transaction\ntime, are taken into account. In particular, with different parameters\nregarding context dimensions that are specified by a buyer, different sets of\nCTT values can be calculated. As a result, all these values can outline the\nreputation profile of a seller that indicates the dynamic trust levels of a\nseller in different product categories, price ranges, time periods, and any\nnecessary combination of them. We term this new model as ReputationPro.\nHowever, in ReputationPro, the computation of reputation profile requires novel\nalgorithms for the precomputation of aggregates over large-scale ratings and\ntransaction data of three context dimensions as well as new data structures for\nappropriately indexing aggregation results to promptly answer buyers' CTT\nrequests. To solve these challenging problems, we then propose a new index\nscheme CMK-tree. After that, we further extend CMK-tree and propose a\nCMK-treeRS approach to reducing the storage space allocated to each seller.\nFinally, the experimental results illustrate that the CMK-tree is superior in\nefficiency for computing CTT values to all three existing approaches in the\nliterature. In addition, though with reduced storage space, the CMK-treeRS\napproach can further improve the performance in answering buyers' CTT queries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Nov 2013 02:32:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 Nov 2013 04:36:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 5 May 2014 23:27:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-27"}

Using the published photometric data with near-\nand mid-infrared archival data we confirmed the normal reddening law (R_V =\n3.1) toward the cluster (IC 1848). A careful zero-age main sequence fitting\ngives a distance modulus of V_0 - M_V = 11.7 +/- 0.2 mag, equivalent to 2.2 +/-\n0.2 kpc. H alpha photometry and the list of young stellar objects identified by\nKoenig et al. permitted us to select a large number of PMS stars comprising 196\nH alpha emission stars, 35 H alpha emission candidates, 5 Class I, 368 Class\nII, and 24 transition disk candidates. From the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram\nusing stellar evolution models, we estimate an age of 5 Myr from several\nevolved stars and 3 Myr from the PMS stars. The IMF was derived from stars with\nmass larger than 3 M_sun, and the slope is slightly steeper (Gamma = -1.6 +/-\n0.2) than the Salpeter/Kroupa IMF. Finally, we estimated the mass accretion\nrate of PMS stars with a UV excess. The mean mass accretion rate is about 1.4 x\n10^-8 M_sun yr^-1 in the mass range of 0.5 M_sun to 2 M_sun, whereas\nintermediate-mass stars (>= 2.5 M_sun) exhibit a much higher accretion rate of\ndM/dt > 10^-6 M_sun yr^-1.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Nov 2013 04:24:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

It is pointed out that the velocity\nengineering is considered as a factor to control the band gap of\nsymmetry-broken bilayer graphene. The band gap is direct and independent of\nvelocity value if velocity modulated in two layers is set up equally.\nOtherwise, in the case of interlayer asymmetric velocity, not only the band gap\nis indirect, but also the electron-hole symmetry fails. This band gap is\ncontrollable by the ratio of the velocity modulated in the upper layer to the\nvelocity modulated in the lower layer. In more detail, the shift of momentum\nfrom the conduction band edge to the valence band edge can be engineered by the\ngate bias and velocity ratio. A transfer matrix method is also elaborated to\ncalculate four-band coherent conductance through a velocity barrier possibly\nsubjected to a gate bias. Electronic transport depends on the ratio of velocity\nmodulated inside the barrier to the one for surrounding regions. As a result, a\nquantum version of total internal reflection is observed for enough thick\nvelocity barriers.

A new feature of this work is the implementation\nof the local inextensibility condition in the diffuse interface context. Local\ninextensibility is enforced by using a local Lagrange multiplier, which\nprovides the necessary tension force at the interface. To solve for the local\nLagrange multiplier, we introduce a new equation whose solution essentially\nprovides a harmonic extension of the local Lagrange multiplier off the\ninterface while maintaining the local inextensibility constraint near the\ninterface. To make the method more robust, we develop a local relaxation scheme\nthat dynamically corrects local stretching/compression errors thereby\npreventing their accumulation. Asymptotic analysis is presented that shows that\nour new system converges to a relaxed version of the inextensible sharp\ninterface model. This is also verified numerically. Although the model does not\ndepend on dimension, we present numerical simulations only in 2D. To solve the\n2D equations numerically, we develop an efficient algorithm combining an\noperator splitting approach with adaptive finite elements where the\nNavier-Stokes equations are implicitly coupled to the diffuse interface\ninextensibility equation. Numerical simulations of a single vesicle in a shear\nflow at different Reynolds numbers demonstrate that errors in enforcing local\ninextensibility may accumulate and lead to large differences in the dynamics in\nthe tumbling regime and differences in the inclination angle of vesicles in the\ntank-treading regime. The local relaxation algorithm is shown to effectively\nprevent this accumulation by driving the system back to its equilibrium state\nwhen errors in local inextensibility arise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Nov 2013 05:15:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

This presents a paradox: downstream shape change\nindicates substantial abrasion, while size change apparently rules it out.

As a consequence,\nabrasion occurs in two well-separated phases: first, pebble edges rapidly round\nwithout any change in axis dimensions until the shape becomes entirely convex;\nand second, axis dimensions are then slowly reduced while the particle remains\nconvex.

Thus, the smoothing of the target\nfunction with respect to the intrinsic, low-dimensional representation that\ndescribes the geometric structure of the examined data is a challenging task.\n  In this paper we propose Auto-adaptive Laplacian Pyramids (ALP), an extension\nof the standard Laplacian Pyramids model that incorporates a modified LOOCV\nprocedure that avoids the large cost of the standard one and offers the\nfollowing advantages: (i) it selects automatically the optimal function\nresolution (stopping time) adapted to the data and its noise, (ii) it is easy\nto apply as it does not require parameterization, (iii) it does not overfit the\ntraining set and (iv) it adds no extra cost compared to other classical\ninterpolation methods. We illustrate numerically ALP's behavior on a synthetic\nproblem and apply it to the computation of the DM projection of new patterns\nand to the extension to them of target function values on a radiation\nforecasting problem over very high dimensional patterns.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Nov 2013 09:03:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 May 2014 10:17:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-21"}

Semi-grey atmospheric models (with one opacity for the visible and\none opacity for the infrared) are useful to understand the global structure of\nirradiated atmospheres, their dynamics and the interior structure and evolution\nof planets, brown dwarfs and stars. But when compared to direct numerical\nradiative transfer calculations for irradiated exoplanets, these models\nsystematically overestimate the temperatures at low optical depth,\nindependently of the opacity parameters. We wish to understand why semi-grey\nmodels fail at low optical depths, and provide a more accurate approximation to\nthe atmospheric structure by accounting for the variable opacity in the\ninfrared. Our analytical irradiated non-grey model is found to provide a range\nof temperatures that is consistent with that obtained by numerical\ncalculations. We find that even for slightly non-grey thermal opacities the\ntemperature structure differs significantly from previous semi-grey models. For\nsmall values of beta (expected when lines are dominant), we find that the\nnon-grey effects are confined to low-optical depths. However, for beta larger\nthan 0.5 (appropriate in the presence of bands with a wavelength-dependence\nsmaller or comparable with the width of the Planck function), we find that the\ntemperature structure is affected even down to infrared optical depths unity\nand deeper as a result of the so-called blanketing effect. The expressions that\nwe derive may be used to provide a proper functional form for algorithms that\ninvert the atmospheric properties from spectral information. Because a full\natmospheric structure can be calculated directly, these expressions should be\nuseful for simulations of the dynamics of these atmospheres and of the thermal\nevolution of the planets. Finally, they should be used to test full radiative\ntransfer models and improve their convergence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Nov 2013 09:06:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

It is\nobtained by natural modifications of the well-known leapfrog method, which is a\nsecond order, two-step, explicit method. According to the latter method, the\ninput data for an integration step are two system states, which refer to\ndifferent times. The usage of two states instead of a single one can be seen as\nthe reason for the robustness of the method. Since the time step size thus is\npart of the step input data, it is complicated to change this size during the\ncomputation of a discrete trajectory. This is a serious drawback when one needs\nto implement automatic time step control.\n  The proposed modification transforms one of the two input states into a\nvelocity and thus gets rid of the time step dependency in the step input data.\nFor these new step input data, the leapfrog method gives a unique prescription\nhow to evolve them stepwise.\n  The stability properties of this modified method are the same as for the\noriginal one: the set of absolute stability is the interval [-i,+i] on the\nimaginary axis. This implies exponential growth of trajectories in situations\nwhere the exact trajectory has an asymptote.\n  By considering new evolution steps that are composed of two consecutive old\nevolution steps we can average over the velocities of the sub-steps and get an\nintegrator with a much larger set of absolute stability, which is immune to the\nasymptote problem.\n  The method is exemplified with the equation of motion of a one-dimensional\nnon-linear oscillator describing the radial motion in the Kepler problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Nov 2013 09:40:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Jun 2014 11:11:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 15 Apr 2016 17:39:03 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 25 Apr 2016 11:35:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-26"}

In this paper\nwe study the long-term correlation between $\\log R'_{HK}$ and $\\log\nI_{H\\alpha}$, two indices based on the Ca II H & K and H$\\alpha$ lines\nrespectively, for a sample of 271 FGK stars using measurements obtained over a\n$\\sim$9 year time span. Because stellar activity is one of the main obstacles\nto the detection of low-mass and long-period planets, understanding further\nthis activity index correlation can give us some hints about the optimal target\nto focus on, and ways to correct for these activity effects. We found a great\nvariety of long-term correlations between $\\log R'_{HK}$ and $\\log\nI_{H\\alpha}$. Around 20% of our sample has strong positive correlation between\nthe indices while about 3% show strong negative correlation. These fractions\nare compatible with those found for the case of early-M dwarfs. Stars\nexhibiting a positive correlation have a tendency to be more active when\ncompared to the median of the sample, while stars showing a negative\ncorrelation are more present among higher metallicity stars. There is also a\ntendency for the positively correlated stars to be more present among the\ncoolest stars, a result which is probably due to the activity level effect on\nthe correlation. Activity level and metallicity seem therefore to be playing a\nrole on the correlation between $\\log R'_{HK}$ and $\\log I_{H\\alpha}$.

Dhaloes are thus well-suited for modelling galaxy formation and their\nmerger trees form the basis of the Durham semi-analytic galaxy formation model,\nGALFORM. Applying the Dhalo construction to the LambdaCDM Millennium-2\nsimulation we find that approximately 90% of Dhaloes have a one-to-one,\nbijective match with a corresponding FoF halo. The remaining 10% are typically\nsecondary components of large FoF haloes. Although the mass functions of both\ntypes of haloes are similar, the mass of Dhaloes correlates much more tightly\nwith the virial mass, M200, than FoF haloes. Approximately 80% of FoF and\nbijective and non-bijective Dhaloes are relaxed according to standard criteria.\nFor these relaxed haloes all three types have similar concentration-M200\nrelations and, at fixed mass, the concentration distributions are described\naccurately by log-normal distributions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Nov 2013 13:03:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 28 Feb 2014 14:33:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

We detail how ontology merging can be used for\ncomposition which expedites the whole process. We discuss how framework\nprovides customer specific ontology merging and repository. We also elaborate\non how merging of ontologies is carried out.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Nov 2013 15:41:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-27"}

However, identifying the fine\nstructures of the smallest capillary vessels via conventional imaging ways\nremains a big challenge. Here, the room temperature liquid metal angiography\nwas proposed for the first time to produce mega contrast X-ray images for\nmulti-scale vasculature mapping. Gallium was used as the room temperature\nliquid metal contrast agent and perfused into the vessels of in vitro pig\nhearts and kidneys. We scanned the samples under X-ray and compared the\nangiograms with those obtained via conventional contrast agent--the iohexol. As\nquantitatively proved by the gray scale histograms, the contrast of the vessels\nto the surrounding tissues in the liquid metal angiograms is orders higher than\nthat of the iohexol enhanced images. And the resolution of the angiograms has\nreached 100{\\mu}m, which means the capillaries can be clearly distinguished in\nthe liquid metal enhanced images. With tomography from the micro-CT, we also\nmanaged to reconstruct the 3-dementional structures of the kidney vessels.\nTremendous clarity and efficiency of the method over existing approaches were\nexperimentally demonstrated.

Initially, the objective function (OF) is formulated as the\nratio of the spectral-efficiency (SE) over the power consumption of the\nnetwork. This OF is shown to be quasi-concave, thus Dinkelbach's method can be\nemployed for solving it as a series of parameterized concave problems. We\ncharacterize the performance of the aforementioned method by comparing the\noptimal solutions obtained to those found using an exhaustive search.\nAdditionally, we explore the relationship between the achievable SE and EE in\nthe cellular network upon increasing the number of active users. In general,\nincreasing the number of users supported by the system benefits both the SE and\nEE, and higher SE values may be obtained at the cost of EE, when an increased\npower may be allocated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Nov 2013 22:37:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-30"}
