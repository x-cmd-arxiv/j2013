Based on the idea of Alpar et al., I develop a description of the\ncoupling between the solid and liquid components of a neutron star through {\\em\nthermally-activated vortex slippage}, and calculate the the response to a spin\nglitch. The treatment begins with a derivation of the vortex velocity from the\nvorticity equations of motion. The activation energy for vortex slippage is\nobtained from a detailed study of the mechanics and energetics of vortex\nmotion. I show that the \"linear creep\" regime introduced by Alpar et al. and\ninvoked in fits to post-glitch response is not realized for physically\nreasonable parameters, a conclusion that strongly constrains the physics of\npost-glitch response through thermal activation. Moreover, a regime of\n\"superweak pinning\", crucial to the theory of Alpar et al. and its extensions,\nis probably precluded by thermal fluctuations. The theory given here has a\nrobust conclusion that can be tested by observations: {\\em for a glitch in spin\nrate of magnitude $\\Delta\\nu$, pinning introduces a delay in the post-glitch\nresponse time}. The delay time is $t_d=7\n(t_{sd}/10^4\\mbox{yr})((\\Delta\\nu/\\nu)/10^{-6})$ d where $t_{sd}$ is the\nspin-down age; $t_d$ is typically weeks for the Vela pulsar and months in older\npulsars, and is independent of the details of vortex pinning. Post-glitch\nresponse through thermal activation cannot occur more quickly than this\ntimescale. Quicker components of post-glitch response as have been observed in\nsome pulsars, notably, the Vela pulsar, cannot be due to thermally-activated\nvortex motion but must represent a different process, such as drag on vortices\nin regions where there is no pinning. I also derive the mutual friction force\nfor a pinned superfluid at finite temperature for use in other studies of\nneutron star hydrodynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Nov 2013 16:52:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Apr 2014 08:13:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 18 Jun 2014 18:09:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

In QEC, information is\nredundantly stored in a large Hilbert space and one or more observables must be\nmonitored to reveal the occurrence of an error, without disturbing the\ninformation encoded in an unknown quantum state. Such observables, typically\nmulti-qubit parities such as <XXXX>, must correspond to a special symmetry\nproperty inherent to the encoding scheme. Measurements of these observables, or\nerror syndromes, must also be performed in a quantum non-demolition (QND) way\nand faster than the rate at which errors occur. Previously, QND measurements of\nquantum jumps between energy eigenstates have been performed in systems such as\ntrapped ions, electrons, cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED), nitrogen-vacancy\n(NV) centers, and superconducting qubits. So far, however, no fast and repeated\nmonitoring of an error syndrome has been realized. Here, we track the quantum\njumps of a possible error syndrome, the photon number parity of a microwave\ncavity, by mapping this property onto an ancilla qubit. This quantity is just\nthe error syndrome required in a recently proposed scheme for a\nhardware-efficient protected quantum memory using Schr\\\"{o}dinger cat states in\na harmonic oscillator. We demonstrate the projective nature of this measurement\nonto a parity eigenspace by observing the collapse of a coherent state onto\neven or odd cat states. The measurement is fast compared to the cavity\nlifetime, has a high single-shot fidelity, and has a 99.8% probability per\nsingle measurement of leaving the parity unchanged. In combination with the\ndeterministic encoding of quantum information in cat states realized earlier,\nour demonstrated QND parity tracking represents a significant step towards\nimplementing an active system that extends the lifetime of a quantum bit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Nov 2013 19:15:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-25"}

The former is much\nfaster, but approximates probabilities with powers of 2, usually leading to\nrelatively low compression rates. The latter uses nearly exact probabilities -\neasily approaching theoretical compression rate limit (Shannon entropy), but at\ncost of much larger computational cost.\n  Asymmetric numeral systems (ANS) is a new approach to accurate entropy\ncoding, which allows to end this trade-off between speed and rate: the recent\nimplementation [1] provides about $50\\%$ faster decoding than HC for 256 size\nalphabet, with compression rate similar to provided by AC. This advantage is\ndue to being simpler than AC: using single natural number as the state, instead\nof two to represent a range. Beside simplifying renormalization, it allows to\nput the entire behavior for given probability distribution into a relatively\nsmall table: defining entropy coding automaton. The memory cost of such table\nfor 256 size alphabet is a few kilobytes. There is a large freedom while\nchoosing a specific table - using pseudorandom number generator initialized\nwith cryptographic key for this purpose allows to simultaneously encrypt the\ndata.\n  This article also introduces and discusses many other variants of this new\nentropy coding approach, which can provide direct alternatives for standard AC,\nfor large alphabet range coding, or for approximated quasi arithmetic coding.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Nov 2013 19:21:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Jan 2014 11:35:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-07"}

Therefore, universal adiabatic quantum computation requires a\nmethod for approximating quantum many-body Hamiltonians up to arbitrary\nspectral error using at most 2-body interactions. Hamiltonian gadgets,\nintroduced around a decade ago, offer the only current means to address this\nrequirement. Although the applications of Hamiltonian gadgets have steadily\ngrown since their introduction, little progress has been made in overcoming the\nlimitations of the gadgets themselves. In this experimentally motivated\ntheoretical study, we introduce several gadgets which require significantly\nmore realistic control parameters than similar gadgets in the literature.

This detection reduces the amount of\ninformation to be processed, since the redundant information (considered less\nrelevant) can be unconsidered. The technique of edge detection consists of\ndetermining the points of a digital image whose intensity changes sharply. This\nchanges are due to the discontinuities of the orientation on a surface for\nexample. A well known method of edge detection is the Difference of Gaussians\n(DoG). The method consists of subtracting two Gaussians, where a kernel has a\nstandard deviation smaller than the previous one. The convolution between the\nsubtraction of kernels and the input image results in the edge detection of\nthis image.

So far, the calibration has employed a\nhandful of NR waveforms with a total length of ~30 cycles, the length being\nlimited by the computational cost of NR simulations.

In a breakthrough\npaper Fiorini et al. [Proceedings of 44th ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing\n2012, pages 95-106] showed that any linear programming formulation of\nmaximum-cut must have exponential size. A natural question to ask is whether\none can prove such strong lower bounds for semidefinite programming\nformulations. In this paper we take a step towards this goal and we prove\nstrong lower bounds for a certain class of SDP formulations, namely SDPs over\nthe Cartesian product of fixed-size positive semidefinite cones. In practice\nthis corresponds to semidefinite programs with a block-diagonal structure and\nwhere blocks have constant size d. We show that any such extended formulation\nof the cut polytope must have exponential size (when d is fixed). The result of\nFiorini et al. for LP formulations is obtained as a special case when d=1. For\nblocks of size d=2 the result rules out any small formulations using\nsecond-order cone programming. Our study of SDP lifts over Cartesian product of\nfixed-size positive semidefinite cones is motivated mainly from practical\nconsiderations where it is well known that such SDPs can be solved more\nefficiently than general SDPs. The proof of our lower bound relies on new\nresults about the sparsity pattern of certain matrices with small psd rank,\ncombined with an induction argument inspired from the recent paper by Kaibel\nand Weltge [arXiv:1307.3543] on the LP extension complexity of the correlation\npolytope.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Nov 2013 20:37:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-12"}

Our main contribution is a $1-O(\\sqrt{(\\log{d})/B})$-competitive\nonline algorithm, where $d$ denotes the column sparsity, i.e., the maximum\nnumber of resources that occur in a single column, and $B$ denotes the capacity\nratio $B$, i.e., the ratio between the capacity of a resource and the maximum\ndemand for this resource.

A statistical\ncomparison of model outputs and real observables is used to obtain a\n\"best-fitting\" parameter set. We consider different Milky Way-like dark matter\nhalos to account for the dependence of the best-fitting parameters selection\nprocess on the underlying merger history of the models. For all formation\nhistories considered, running ChemTreeN with best-fitting parameters produced\nluminosity functions that tightly fit their observed counterpart. However, only\none of the resulting stellar halo models was able to reproduce the observed\nstellar halo mass within 40 kpc of the Galactic center. On the basis of this\nanalysis it is possible to disregard certain models, and their corresponding\nmerger histories, as good representations of the underlying merger history of\nthe Milky Way.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Nov 2013 21:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Apr 2014 17:47:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

However, most current models fail to reproduce the\nclustering of low-mass galaxies on small scales ($r<1Mpc/h$). In this paper we\nstudy the galaxy clusterings predicted from a few semi-analytical models. We\nfirstly compare two Munich versions, Guo et al. (2011, Guo11) and De Lucia \\&\nBlazoit (2007, DLB07). The Guo11 model well reproduces the galaxy stellar mass\nfunction, but over-predicts the clustering of low-mass galaxies on small\nscales. The DLB07 model provides a better fit to the clustering on small\nscales, but over-predicts the stellar mass function. These seem to be puzzling.\nWe find that there is slightly more fraction of satellite galaxies residing in\nmassive haloes in the Guo11 model, which is the dominant contribution to the\nclustering discrepancy between the two models. However, both models still\nover-predict the clustering at $0.1Mpc/h<r<10Mpc/h$ for low mass galaxies. This\nis because both models over-predict the number of satellites by $30\\%$ in\nmassive halos than the data. Actually, the better agreement of DLB07 model with\nthe data on small scales comes as a coincidence as it predicts too many\nlow-mass central galaxies which are less clustered and thus bring down the\ntotal clustering. Finally, we show the predictions from the semi-analytical of\nKang et al. (2012). We find that this model can simultaneously fit the stellar\nmass function and galaxy clustering if the supernova feedback in satellite\ngalaxies is stronger. We conclude that semi-analytical models are now able to\nsolve the small-scales clustering problem, without invoking of any other new\nphysics or changing the dark matter properties, such as the recent favored warm\ndark matter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Nov 2013 21:01:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

The\nsparse formulation of the analysis problem allows us to apply methods that rely\non efficient sparse factorization techniques, and our numerical results\nillustrate the effectiveness of this approach compared to methods that are\nbased on the standard formulation of the analysis problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Nov 2013 21:05:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-15"}

Diffuse shock-acceleration fails to explain\nthe flares because particle acceleration and emission occur during a single or\neven sub-Larmor timescale. In this regime, the synchrotron energy losses induce\na drag force on the particle motion that balances the electric acceleration and\nprevents the emission of synchrotron radiation above 160 MeV. Previous\nanalytical studies and 2D particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations indicate that\nrelativistic reconnection is a viable mechanism to circumvent the above\ndifficulties. The reconnection electric field localized at X-points linearly\naccelerates particles with little radiative energy losses. In this paper, we\ncheck whether this mechanism survives in 3D, using a set of large PIC\nsimulations with radiation reaction force and with a guide field. In agreement\nwith earlier works, we find that the relativistic drift kink instability\ndeforms and then disrupts the layer, resulting in significant plasma heating\nbut few non-thermal particles. A moderate guide field stabilizes the layer and\nenables particle acceleration. We report that 3D magnetic reconnection can\naccelerate particles above the standard radiation reaction limit, although the\neffect is less pronounced than in 2D with no guide field. We confirm that the\nhighest energy particles form compact bunches within magnetic flux ropes, and a\nbeam tightly confined within the reconnection layer, which could result in the\nobserved Crab flares when, by chance, the beam crosses our line of sight.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Nov 2013 21:07:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Jan 2014 16:33:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

However, manual counting of these images is\nboth tiring and unreliable and ultimately very time-consuming for biomedical\nresearchers. Not only does this slow down the overall research process, it also\nintroduces counting errors due to a lack of objectivity and consistency\ninherent to the researchers own human nature.\n  This thesis addresses this issue by automatically determining infection\nindexes of macrophages parasite by Leishmania in microscopy images using\ncomputer vision and pattern recognition methodologies. Initially images are\nsubmitted to a pre-processing stage that consists in a normalization of\nillumination conditions. Three algorithms are then applied in parallel to each\nimage. Algorithm A intends to detect macrophage nuclei and consists of\nsegmentation via adaptive multi-threshold, and classification of resulting\nregions using a set of collected features. Algorithm B intends to detect\nparasites and is similar to Algorithm A but the adaptive multi-threshold is\nparameterized with a different constraints vector. Algorithm C intends to\ndetect the macrophages and parasites cytoplasm and consists of a cut-off\nversion of the previous two algorithms, where the classification step is\nskipped. Regions with multiple nuclei or parasites are processed by a voting\nsystem that employs both a Support Vector Machine and a set of region features\nfor determining the number of objects present in each region. The previous vote\nis then taken into account as the number of mixtures to be used in a Gaussian\nMixture Model to decluster the said region. Finally each parasite is assigned\nto, at most, a single macrophage using minimum Euclidean distance to a cell\nnucleus, thus quantifying Leishmania infection levels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Nov 2013 21:42:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-13"}

However, large $n$ player interactions are more realistically\nmodeled as games of incomplete information, where players may know little to\nnothing about the types of other players. Unfortunately, games in incomplete\ninformation settings lose many of the nice properties of complete information\ngames: the quality of equilibria can become worse, the equilibria lose their\nex-post properties, and coordinating on an equilibrium becomes even more\ndifficult. Because of these problems, we would like to study games of\nincomplete information, but still implement equilibria of the complete\ninformation game induced by the (unknown) realized player types.\n  This problem was recently studied by Kearns et al. and solved in large games\nby means of introducing a weak mediator: their mediator took as input reported\ntypes of players, and output suggested actions which formed a correlated\nequilibrium of the underlying game. Players had the option to play\nindependently of the mediator, or ignore its suggestions, but crucially, if\nthey decided to opt-in to the mediator, they did not have the power to lie\nabout their type. In this paper, we rectify this deficiency in the setting of\nlarge congestion games. We give, in a sense, the weakest possible mediator: it\ncannot enforce participation, verify types, or enforce its suggestions.\nMoreover, our mediator implements a Nash equilibrium of the complete\ninformation game. We show that it is an (asymptotic) ex-post equilibrium of the\nincomplete information game for all players to use the mediator honestly, and\nthat when they do so, they end up playing an approximate Nash equilibrium of\nthe induced complete information game. In particular, truthful use of the\nmediator is a Bayes-Nash equilibrium in any Bayesian game for any prior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Nov 2013 21:50:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Dec 2015 16:26:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-11"}

The vast majority of\ntechnical contributions in the area of relaying neglect hardware impairments\nand, thus, assumes ideal hardware. Such approximations make sense in low-rate\nsystems, but can lead to very misleading results when analyzing future\nhigh-rate systems. This paper quantifies the impact of hardware impairments on\ndual-hop relaying, for both amplify-and-forward and decode-and-forward\nprotocols. The outage probability (OP) in these practical scenarios is a\nfunction of the effective end-to-end signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio\n(SNDR). This paper derives new closed-form expressions for the exact and\nasymptotic OPs, accounting for hardware impairments at the source, relay, and\ndestination. A similar analysis for the ergodic capacity is also pursued,\nresulting in new upper bounds. We assume that both hops are subject to\nindependent but non-identically distributed Nakagami-m fading. This paper\nvalidates that the performance loss is small at low rates, but otherwise can be\nvery substantial. In particular, it is proved that for high signal-to-noise\nratio (SNR), the end-to-end SNDR converges to a deterministic constant, coined\nthe SNDR ceiling, which is inversely proportional to the level of impairments.\nThis stands in contrast to the ideal hardware case in which the end-to-end SNDR\ngrows without bound in the high-SNR regime. Finally, we provide fundamental\ndesign guidelines for selecting hardware that satisfies the requirements of a\npractical relaying system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Nov 2013 22:29:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 May 2014 06:47:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-02"}

We engineer an experimental Prisoner's Dilemma game\nin the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to show that, despite losing to\ndefectors in nonexpanding conditions, cooperators increase in frequency in\nspatially expanding populations.

That\nis the necessary signaling which guarantee the operation of those techniques.\nThe design and transmission of those signaling, especially the over-the-air\n(OTA) signaling, is challenging. In this article, we provide an overview of the\nOTA signaling in cellular networks to provide insights on the design of OTA\nsignaling. Specifically, we first give a brief introduction of the OTA\nsignaling in long term evolution (LTE), and then we discuss the challenges and\nrequirements in designing the OTA signaling in cellular networks in detail.

We also measure the electric polarization versus the\nelectric field curve/loop under the static field up to 23 T.

Moreover, the magnetization plateaus are\nfound at high magnetic fields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Nov 2013 07:54:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-13"}

For the Neumann-Neumann method, one step of the method\nconsists of solving the subdomain problems using Dirichlet interface\nconditions, followed by a correction step involving Neumann interface\nconditions.

Stars form in dense, dusty clumps of molecular clouds, but little is\nknown about their origin, their evolution and their detailed physical\nproperties.

As a side product, we\nfind a strong correlation of the radiative efficiency with M and show that this\ntrend is most likely produced by selection effects in combination with the mass\nerrors and the use of the scaling relation for dM/dt. The anti-correlations\nfound for V cannot be explained in such a way. The strongest anti-correlation\nis found with dM/dt. However, it is difficult to decide which of the quantities\n(L, Eddington ratio, dM/dt) is intrinsically correlated with V and which of the\nobserved correlations are produced by the relations between these quantities. A\nV-dM/dt anti-correlation is qualitatively expected for the strongly\ninhomogeneous accretion disks. We argue that several observed variability\nproperties are not adequately explained by the simple multi-temperature\nblack-body model of a standard disk and suggest to check whether the strongly\ninhomogeneous disk model is capable of reproducing these observations better.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Nov 2013 12:44:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

Tests of the detector prototype DANSSino demonstrated that in\nspite of a small size (20x20x100 cm^3) it is quite sensitive to reactor\nantineutrinos, detecting about 70 Inverse Beta Decay events per day with the\nsignal-to-background ratio of about unity. The prototype tests have\ndemonstrated feasibility to reach the design performance of the DANSS detector.\nThe DANSS experiment will detect about 10 thousand antineutrino events per day\nwith a background below ~1%. Detector will be calibrated every day and its\nposition will be changed frequently to reduce systematic errors. These features\nwill provide a high sensitivity to reactor antineutrino oscillations to sterile\nneutrinos, suggested recently to explain a so-called \"reactor anomaly\". Data\ntaking will start already next year.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Nov 2013 13:39:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-13"}

First, using the explicit scheme, we calculate the solution at\na new time level. Next, we employ this solution in order to obtain the solution\nat the previous time level (the implicit scheme, explicit calculations). This\nsolution should be close to the solution of our problem at this time level with\na prescribed accuracy. Such an algorithm leads to explicit formulas for the\ncalculation of the time step and takes into account both the dynamics of the\nproblem solution and changes in coefficients of the equation and in its\nright-hand side.

As the two models predict similar corrections to the\ndipole coefficient $C_7^{\\rm eff}$ whereas similar magnitudes but with opposite\nsigns to $C_8^{\\rm eff}$, the branching ratios cannot discriminate the two\nmodels, and we have to resort to the direct CP and isospin asymmetries of $b\\to\ns$ processes, which are more sensitive to $C_8^{\\rm eff}$.

From a dynamical systems viewpoint, it is\ndesirable to obtain corresponding exact solutions, though their existence is\nnot guaranteed. A damping filter method is introduced to obtain variously\nlocalized solutions, and adopted into two typical cases. This method introduces\na spatially selective damping effect to make a good guess at the exact\nsolution, and we can obtain an exact solution through a continuation with the\ndamping amplitude. First target is a steady solution to Swift-Hohenberg\nequation, which is a representative of bi-stable systems in which localized\nsolutions coexist, and a model for span-wisely localized cases. Not only\nsolutions belonging to the well-known snaking branches but also those belonging\nto an isolated branch known as \"isolas\" are found with a continuation paths\nbetween them in phase space extended with the damping amplitude. This indicates\nthat this spatially selective excitation mechanism has an advantage in\nsearching spatially localized solutions. Second target is a spatially localized\ntraveling-wave solution to Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, which is a model for\nstream-wisely localized cases. Since the spatially selective damping effect\nbreaks Galilean and translational invariances, the propagation velocity cannot\nbe determined uniquely while the damping is active, and a singularity arises\nwhen these invariances are recovered. We demonstrate that this singularity can\nbe avoided by imposing a simple condition, and a localized traveling-wave\nsolution is obtained with a specific propagation speed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Nov 2013 14:32:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 30 Apr 2014 09:25:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-21"}

The subsequently occurring thermonuclear runaway reaches hundreds\nof megakelvin and explosively ejects matter into the interstellar medium. The\nexact peak temperature strongly depends on the underlying white dwarf mass, the\naccreted mass and metallicity, and the initial white dwarf luminosity.\nObservations of elemental abundance enrichments in these classical nova events\nimply that the ejected matter consists not only of processed solar material\nfrom the main sequence partner but also of material from the outer layers of\nthe underlying white dwarf. This indicates that white dwarf and accreted matter\nmix prior to the thermonuclear runaway. The processes by which this mixing\noccurs require further investigation to be understood.

While dependence free loops are fully\nparallelizable, those with loop carried dependences are not. Dependence\ndistance is a measure of absolute difference between a pair of dependent\niterations. Loops with constant distance data dependence, because of uniform\ndistance between the dependent iterations, lead to easy partitioning of the\niteration space and hence they have been successfully dealt with.\n  Parallelization of loops with variable distance data dependences is a\nconsiderably difficult problem. It is our belief that partitioning the\niteration space in such loops cannot be done without examining solutions of the\ncorresponding Linear Diophantine Equations. Focus of this work is to study\nvariable distance data dependences and examine the relation between dependent\niterations.
