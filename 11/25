The fitted models serve as a basis for exploring the connection\nbetween words and variables of interest, for reducing dimension into supervised\nfactor scores, and for prediction.

Often, these approaches\nleave a number of scalability issues open.

We show that the statistical hadronization model (SHM) well\ndescribes particle production in QGP hadronization. For all centralities, the\nphysical properties are compatible with the earlier proposed critical\nhadronization pressure suggesting universal hadronization conditions of QGP.\n  Heavy-ion collisions at LHC present a new challenge for SHM in describing\nparticle production at TeV energy scales. We show that the chemical\nnon-equilibrium model gives a good description of the hadron production in\nPb--Pb collisions at 2.76 TeV consistently as a function of centrality.\nMoreover, the model parameters assume expected values suggested by previous\nstudies at lower energies. The quark-gluon plasma fireball hadronizes at the\nsame universal hadronization conditions, that is a common critical pressure,\nentropy and energy density.\n  At LHC energies, a significant amount of charm is expected to be produced and\nit is therefore crucial to incorporate charm into the present description of\nparticle production. We present an upgraded SHARE with CHARM program, that\nquantifies the effect of charm on the yield of lighter hadrons and physical\nproperties of the hadronizing fireball. In addition to light flavors ($u,d,s$),\nSHARE with CHARM describes charm hadron production and decays. We observe, that\naccording to present experimental results, charm decays mainly affect the\nyields of multistrange particles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Nov 2013 19:03:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-26"}

These samples included the\noriginal soil, the soil modified by adding a hot water extract (HWE) fraction\n(soil+3 HWE and soil+6 HWE), and the pyrolyzed soil. The SOM contents increased\nin the order pyrolyzed soil < original soil < soil+3 HWE < soil+6 HWE. For the\nlatter three samples this order was also valid for the HCB adsorption. The\npyrolyzed soil adsorbed more HCB than the other samples at low initial\nconcentrations, but at higher concentrations the HCB adsorption became weaker\nthan in the samples with HWE addition. This adsorption behaviour combined with\nthe differences in the chemical composition between the soil samples suggested\nthat alkylated aromatic, phenol, and lignin monomer compounds contributed most\nto the HCB adsorption. To obtain a molecular level understanding, a test set\nhas been developed on the basis of elemental analysis which comprises 32\nrepresentative soil constituents. The calculated binding free energy for HCB\nwith each representative system shows that HCB binds to SOM stronger than to\nsoil minerals. For SOM, HCB binds to alkylated aromatic, phenols, lignin\nmonomers, and hydrophobic aliphatic compounds stronger than to polar aliphatic\ncompounds confirming the above adsorption isotherms. Moreover, quantitative\nstructure-activity relationship (QSAR) of the binding free energy with\nindependent physical properties of the test set systems for the first time\nindicated that the polarizability, the partial charge on the carbon atoms, and\nthe molar volume are the most important properties controlling HCB-SOM\ninteractions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Nov 2013 19:33:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-13"}

The graph is assumed to\nbe partitioned in a balanced fashion among the $k$ machines, a common\nimplementation in many real-world systems. Communication is point-to-point via\nbandwidth-constrained links, and the goal is to minimize the round complexity,\ni.e., the number of communication rounds required to finish a computation.\n  We present a generic methodology that allows to obtain efficient algorithms\nin the $k$-machine model using distributed algorithms for the classical CONGEST\nmodel of distributed computing.

However,\nusage of these insecticides exerts massive selection pressure on mosquitoes,\nresulting in insecticide resistant mosquito breeds. Hence, developing\nalternative strategies is crucial for sustainable malaria control. Here we\nexplore the usefulness of paratransgenesis, i.e., introducing genetically\nengineered bacteria which secrete anti-plasmodium molecules, inside the\nmosquito midgut. The bacteria enter a mosquito's midgut when it drinks from a\nsugar bait, i.e., a sugar solution containing the bacterium.

Our data\nstructure answers IPM queries in time proportional to the quotient $|y|/|x|$ of\nfragments' lengths, which is required due to the information content of the\noutput.

First, we extend the so-called notion\nof instance optimality of a decoder to settings where one only wishes to\nreconstruct some part of the original high dimensional vector from a\nlow-dimensional observation. This covers practical settings such as medical\nimaging of a region of interest, or audio source separation when one is only\ninterested in estimating the contribution of a specific instrument to a musical\nrecording. We define instance optimality relatively to a model much beyond the\ntraditional framework of sparse recovery, and characterize the existence of an\ninstance optimal decoder in terms of joint properties of the model and the\nconsidered linear operator. Noiseless and noise-robust settings are both\nconsidered. We show somewhat surprisingly that the existence of noise-aware\ninstance optimal decoders for all noise levels implies the existence of a\nnoise-blind decoder. A consequence of our results is that for models that are\nrich enough to contain an orthonormal basis, the existence of an L2/L2 instance\noptimal decoder is only possible when the linear operator is not substantially\ndimension-reducing. This covers well-known cases (sparse vectors, low-rank\nmatrices) as well as a number of seemingly new situations (structured sparsity\nand sparse inverse covariance matrices for instance). We exhibit an\noperator-dependent norm which, under a model-specific generalization of the\nRestricted Isometry Property (RIP), always yields a feasible instance\noptimality property. This norm can be upper bounded by an atomic norm relative\nto the considered model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Nov 2013 09:05:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 10 Oct 2014 08:21:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-10"}

In\nthis configuration, each relay stage in a multi-hop relaying network is formed\nby at least two relays, used alternatively in transmit and receive modes, such\nthat while one relay transmits its signal to the next stage, the other relay\nreceives a signal from the previous stage. With such a pipelined scheme, the\nsource is active and sends a new information message in each time slot. We\nconsider the achievable rates for different coding schemes and compare them\nwith a cut-set upper bound, which is tight in certain conditions. In\nparticular, we show that both lattice-based Compute and Forward (CoF) and\nQuantize reMap and Forward (QMF) yield attractive performance and can be easily\nimplemented. In particular, QMF in this context does not require \"long\"\nmessages and joint (non-unique) decoding, if the quantization mean-square\ndistortion at the relays is chosen appropriately. Also, in the multi-hop case\nthe gap of QMF from the cut-set upper bound grows logarithmically with the\nnumber of stages, and not linearly as in the case of \"noise level\"\nquantization. Furthermore, we show that CoF is particularly attractive in the\ncase of multi-hop relaying, when the channel gains have fluctuations not larger\nthan 3dB, yielding a rate that does not depend on the number of relaying\nstages. In particular, we argue that such architecture may be useful for a\nwireless backhaul with line-of-sight propagation between the relays.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Nov 2013 09:54:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-26"}

However, the numerical implementation of Toth et al. was criticised as\nbeing unrealistic, in particular because all the \"intelligence\" was conferred\nto market orders, while limit orders were passive and random. In this work, we\nstudy various alternative specifications of the model, for example allowing\nlimit orders to react to the order flow, or changing the execution protocols.\nBy and large, our study lends strong support to the idea that the square-root\nimpact law is a very generic and robust property that requires very few\ningredients to be valid.

For achieving this, the prescription for reformulating mLCE\ngiven by [Y. Sota, S. Suzuki, and K.-I. Maeda, Classical Quantum Gravity 13,\n1241 (1996)] is adopted. Thus, the geodesic deviation vector approach is\napplied, and the proper time is utilized as measure of time. Following the\naforementioned prescription, the chaotic indicators FLI, MEGNO, GALI, and APLE\nare reformulated. In fact, FLI has been reformulated by adapting other\nprescriptions in the past, but not by adapting the Sota et al. one. By using\none of these previous reformulations of FLI, an approximative expression giving\nMEGNO as function of FLI has been applied on non-integrable curved spacetimes\nin a recent work. In the present work the reformulation of MEGNO is provided by\nadjusting the definition of the indicator to the Sota et al. prescription.\nGALI, and APLE are reformulated in the framework of general relativity for the\nfirst time. All the reformulated indicators by the Sota et al. prescription are\ntested and compared for their efficiency to discern order from chaos.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Nov 2013 12:46:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 7 Feb 2014 10:38:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-12"}
