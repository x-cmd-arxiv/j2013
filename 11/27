In\nthese models new flavour violating interactions of ordinary quarks and leptons\nare dominated by a new heavy Z^prime gauge boson with the strength of the\nrelevant couplings governed by four new parameters in the quark sector and the\nparameter beta. We study the implications of these models for beta=+-n/sqrt{3}\nwith n=1,2,3. The case beta=-sqrt{3} leading to Landau singularities for\nM_{Z'}approx 4Tev can be ruled out when the present constraints on Z^prime\ncouplings, in particular from LEP-II, are taken into account. For n=1,2\ninteresting results are found for M_{Z^prime}< 4Tev with largest NP effects for\nbeta<0 in B_d->K^*mu^+mu^- and the ones in B_{s,d}->mu^+mu^- for beta>0. As\nRe(C_9^NP) can reach the values -0.8 and -0.4 for n=2 and n=1, respectively the\nB_d-> K^*mu^+mu^- anomalies can be softened with the size depending on Delta\nM_s/(Delta M_s)_SM and the CP-asymmetry S_{psiphi}. A correlation between\nRe(C_9^NP) and BR(B_s->mu^+mu^-), identified for beta<0, implies for negative\nRe(C_9^NP) uniquely suppression of BR(B_s->mu^+mu^-) relative to its SM value\nwhich is favoured by the data. In turn also S_{psiphi}< S_{psiphi}^SM is\nfavoured having dominantly opposite sign to S_{psiphi}^SM. We find that the\nabsence of B_d-> K^*mu^+mu^- anomalies in the future data and confirmation of\nthe suppression of BR(B_s->mu^+mu^-) relative to its SM value would favour\nbeta=1/sqrt{3} and M_{Z'}approx 3Tev.

One major hypothesis is that the presence\nor not of a psychiatric disorder can be explained by the differential\nclustering of neurons in the brain. In view of this fact, it is clearly of\ninterest to address the question of whether the properties of the clusters have\nchanged between groups of patients and controls. The normal method of\napproaching group differences in brain imaging is to carry out a voxel-wise\nunivariate analysis for a difference between the mean group responses using an\nappropriate test (e.g. a t-test) and to assemble the resulting \"significantly\ndifferent voxels\" into clusters, testing again at cluster level. In this\napproach of course, the primary voxel-level test is blind to any cluster\nstructure. Direct assessments of differences between groups (or reproducibility\nwithin groups) at the cluster level have been rare in brain imaging. For this\nreason, we introduce a novel statistical test called ANOCVA - ANalysis Of\nCluster structure Variability, which statistically tests whether two or more\npopulations are equally clustered using specific features. The proposed method\nallows us to compare the clustering structure of multiple groups\nsimultaneously, and also to identify features that contribute to the\ndifferential clustering. We illustrate the performance of ANOCVA through\nsimulations and an application to an fMRI data set composed of children with\nADHD and controls.

For close-in\nplanets and satellites, the rotation slowly evolves due to dissipative tidal\neffects until some kind of equilibrium is reached. When the orbits are nearly\ncircular, the rotation period is believed to always end synchronous with the\norbital period.

One\npromising potential implementation is to use superconducting quantum bits in\nthe circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) architecture. There, the low energy\nstates of a nonlinear electronic oscillator are isolated and addressed as a\nqubit. These qubits are capacitively coupled to the modes of a\nmicrowave-frequency transmission line resonator which serves as a quantum\ncommunication bus. Microwave electrical pulses are applied to the resonator to\nmanipulate or measure the qubit state. State control is calibrated using\ndiagnostic sequences that expose systematic errors. Hybridization of the\nresonator with the qubit gives it a nonlinear response when driven strongly,\nuseful for amplifying the measurement signal to enhance accuracy. Qubits\ncoupled to the same bus may coherently interact with one another via the\nexchange of virtual photons. A two-qubit conditional phase gate mediated by\nthis interaction can deterministically entangle its targets, and is used to\ngenerate two-qubit Bell states and three-qubit GHZ states. These three-qubit\nstates are of particular interest because they redundantly encode quantum\ninformation. They are the basis of the quantum repetition code prototypical of\nmore sophisticated schemes required for quantum computation. Using a\nthree-qubit Toffoli gate, this code is demonstrated to autonomously correct\neither bit- or phase-flip errors. Despite observing the expected behavior, the\noverall fidelity is low because of decoherence. A superior implementation of\ncQED replaces the transmission-line resonator with a three-dimensional box\nmode, increasing lifetimes by an order of magnitude. In-situ qubit frequency\ncontrol is enabled with control lines, which are used to fully characterize and\ncontrol the system Hamiltonian.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Nov 2013 18:06:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-01"}

Five years later Moser asked the same question for a convex\npolygon. In 1987 F. Vivaldi and A. Shaidenko showed that all orbits for a\nregular polygon must be bounded. R. Schwartz recently showed that a\nquadrilateral known as a Penrose Kite has unbounded orbits and he proposed that\n'most' convex polygons support unbounded orbits.\n  Except for a few special cases, very little is known about the dynamics of\nthe outer billiards map on regular polygons. In this paper we present a unified\napproach to the analysis of regular polygons - using the canonical 'resonances'\nwhich are shared by all regular N-gons. In the case of the regular pentagon and\nregular octagon these resonances exist on all scales and the fractal structure\nis well documented, but these are the only non-trivial cases that have been\nanalyzed.

For definiteness, we bound\nourselves to the case of Lovelock gravities. These theories are known to have\nseveral branches of asymptotically AdS solutions. Here, extending our previous\nwork, we show that phase transitions among some of these branches are driven by\na thermalon configuration: a bubble separating two regions of different\neffective cosmological constants, generically hosting a black hole in the\ninterior. Above some critical temperature, this thermalon configuration is\npreferred with respect to the finite-temperature AdS space, triggering a\nsophisticated version of the Hawking-Page transition. After being created, the\nunstable bubble configuration can in general dynamically change the asymptotic\ncosmological constant. While this phenomenon already occurs in the case of a\ngravity action with square curvature terms, we point out that in the case of\nLovelock theory with cubic (and higher) terms new effects appear. For instance,\nthe theory may admit more than one type of bubble and branches that are in\nprinciple free of pathologies may also decay through the thermalon mechanism.\nWe also find ranges of the gravitational couplings for which the theory becomes\nsick.

Experimentally, however, Li is\none of a handful of elemental solids (along with Cu, Ag, Au etc.) where the\nsign of the Seebeck coefficient (S) is opposite to that of the carrier. This\ncounterintuitive behavior still lacks a satisfactory interpretation. We\ncalculate S fully from first-principles, within the framework of P.B. Allen's\nformulation of Boltzmann transport theory. Here it is crucial to avoid the\nconstant relaxation time approximation, which gives a sign for S which is\nnecessarily that of the carriers. Our calculated S are in excellent agreement\nwith experimental data, up to the melting point. In comparison with another\nalkali metal Na, we demonstrate that within the simplest non-trivial model for\nthe energy dependency of the electron lifetimes, the rapidly increasing density\nof states (DOS) across the Fermi energy is related to the sign of S in Li. The\nexceptional energy dependence of the DOS is beyond the free-electron model, as\nthe dispersion is distorted by the Brillouin Zone edge, a stronger effect in Li\nthan other Aliki metals. The electron lifetime dependency on energy is central,\nbut the details of the electron-phonon interaction are found to be less\nimportant, contrary to what has been believed for several decades.

Many statistical properties\nof this variability can be naturally explained with the fluctuating accretion\ndisk model, where variations in the mass-transfer rate through the disk are\nmodulated on the local viscous timescale and propagate towards the central\ncompact object. Here, a recently developed implementation of the model is\napplied for the first time to the time-averaged, high-frequency variability of\na cataclysmic variable star (MV Lyrae) observed with the Kepler satellite. A\nqualitatively good fit to the data is achieved, suggesting the presence of\ngeometrically thick inner flow with large viscosity parameter, extending from\n$\\sim0.12R_{\\odot}$ all the way to the white dwarf surface. A simple spectral\nmodel of the system suggests that the geometrically thick component would not\ncontribute much to the observed optical flux originating from the geometrically\nthin outer disk. Instead, X-ray reprocessing from the geometrically thick disk\nonto the thin disk is proposed as a mechanism to explain the observed\nvariability. Similar flows are also deduced in accreting neutron stars/black\nholes (X-ray binaries) and Active Galactic Nuclei. Additionally, eclipse\nmapping studies of cataclysmic variables also seem to suggest the presence of a\ngeometrically extended flow towards the inner-edges of the accretion disk. The\nfluctuating accretion disk model applied here is encouraging in understanding\nthe origin of flickering in cataclysmic variables, as well as in X-ray binaries\nand Active Galactic Nuclei, by providing a unifying scheme by which to explain\nthe observed broad-band variability features observed throughout all compact\naccreting systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Nov 2013 21:00:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

The electronic and\nmechanical properties of CVD-grown graphene depend in large part on the\ncharacteristics of the grain boundaries. However, the physical properties of\nthese grain boundaries remain challenging to characterize directly and\nconveniently. Here, we show that it is possible to visualize and investigate\nthe grain boundaries in CVD-grown graphene using an infrared nano-imaging\ntechnique. We harness surface plasmons that are reflected and scattered by the\ngraphene grain boundaries, thus causing plasmon interference. By recording and\nanalyzing the interference patterns, we can map grain boundaries for a large\narea CVD-grown graphene film and probe the electronic properties of individual\ngrain boundaries. Quantitative analysis reveals that grain boundaries form\nelectronic barriers that obstruct both electrical transport and plasmon\npropagation. The effective width of these barriers (~10-20 nm) depends on the\nelectronic screening and it is on the order of the Fermi wavelength of\ngraphene. These results uncover a microscopic mechanism that is responsible for\nthe low electron mobility observed in CVD-grown graphene, and suggest the\npossibility of using electronic barriers to realize tunable plasmon reflectors\nand phase retarders in future graphene-based plasmonic circuits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Nov 2013 21:51:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-28"}

We have characterised the\nperformance of hexabundles with different cladding thicknesses and compared\nthem to that of the same type of bare fibre, across the range of fill-fractions\nand input f-ratios likely in an IFU instrument. Hexabundles with 7-cores and\n61-cores were tested for focal ratio degradation (FRD), throughput and\ncross-talk when fed with inputs from F/3.4 to >F/8.

We find that the FRD and throughput of the cores in the hexabundles\nmatch the performance of single fibres of the same material at low input\nf-ratios.

It is shown that\nelectrowetting is not an electrocapillarity effect, i.e., it cannot be\nconsistently understood in terms of the variation of the substrate-fluid\ninterfacial tension with the electrostatic substrate potential, but it is\nrelated to the depth of the effective interface potential. The key feature,\nwhich has been overlooked so far and which occurs naturally in the density\nfunctional approach is the structural change of a fluid if it is brought into\ncontact with another fluid. These structural changes occur in the present\ncontext as the formation of finite films of one fluid phase in between the\nsubstrate and the bulk of the other fluid phase. The non-vanishing Donnan\npotentials (Galvani potential differences) across such film-bulk fluid\ninterfaces, which generically occur due to an unequal partitioning of ions as a\nresult of differences of solubility contrasts, lead to correction terms in the\nelectrowetting equation, which become relevant for sufficiently small substrate\npotentials. Whereas the present density functional approach confirms the\ncommonly used electrocapillarity-based electrowetting equation as a good\napproximation for the cases of metallic electrodes or electrodes coated with a\nhydrophobic dielectric in contact with an electrolyte solution and an ion-free\noil, a significantly reduced tendency for electrowetting is predicted for\nelectrodes coated with a dielectric which is hydrophilic or which is in contact\nwith two immiscible electrolyte solutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Nov 2013 07:38:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Feb 2014 12:13:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-07"}

An efficient\nand accurate computation of these derivatives is important, for instance, in\ninverse problems and optimal control problems. This computation is usually\nbased on an adjoint PDE system, and the question addressed in this paper is how\nthe discretization of this adjoint system should relate to the dG\ndiscretization of the hyperbolic state equation. Adjoint-based derivatives can\neither be computed before or after discretization; these two options are often\nreferred to as the optimize-then-discretize and discretize-then-optimize\napproaches. We discuss the relation between these two options for dG\ndiscretizations in space and Runge-Kutta time integration. Discretely exact\ndiscretizations for several hyperbolic optimization problems are derived,\nincluding the advection equation, Maxwell's equations and the coupled\nelastic-acoustic wave equation. We find that the discrete adjoint equation\ninherits a natural dG discretization from the discretization of the state\nequation and that the expressions for the discretely exact gradient often have\nto take into account contributions from element faces. For the coupled\nelastic-acoustic wave equation, the correctness and accuracy of our derivative\nexpressions are illustrated by comparisons with finite difference gradients.\nThe results show that a straightforward discretization of the continuous\ngradient differs from the discretely exact gradient, and thus is not consistent\nwith the discretized objective. This inconsistency may cause difficulties in\nthe convergence of gradient based algorithms for solving optimization problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Nov 2013 08:54:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-28"}

Its spectrum and\ndensity of states coincide with the $SL(2,\\mathbb{R})/U(1)$ Euclidean black\nhole conformal field theory which has been identified previously in the\ncontinuum limit of the vertex model for a particular 'self-dual' choice of the\nstaggering. We also study the asymptotic behaviour of subleading corrections to\nthe finite size scaling and discuss our findings in the context of the\nconformal field theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Nov 2013 09:48:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-10"}

Despite the key role played by\ninhibitory-excitatory couplings in the functioning of brain networks, the\nimpact of a balanced condition on the stability properties of underlying\nnetworks remains largely unknown. We investigate properties of the largest\neigenvalues of networks having such couplings, and find that they follow\ncompletely different statistics when in the balanced situation. Based on\nnumerical simulations, we demonstrate that the transition from Weibull to\nFr\\'echet via the Gumbel distribution can be controlled by the variance of the\ncolumn sum of the adjacency matrix, which depends monotonically on the\ndenseness of the underlying network. As a balanced condition is imposed, the\nlargest real part of the eigenvalue emulates a transition to the generalized\nextreme value statistics, independent of the inhibitory connection probability.\nFurthermore, the transition to the Weibull statistics and the small-world\ntransition occur at the same rewiring probability, reflecting a more stable\nsystem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Nov 2013 12:23:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

In this paper, we study the trapping\nproblem occurring on unweighted and weighted networks, respectively. The\nnetworks under consideration display the striking scale-free, small-world, and\nmodular properties, as observed in diverse real-world systems. For binary\nnetworks, we concentrate on three cases of trapping problems with the trap\nlocated at a peripheral node, a neighbor of the root with the least\nconnectivity, and a farthest node, respectively. For weighted networks with\nedge weights controlled by a parameter, we also study three trapping problems,\nin which the trap is placed separately at the root, a neighbor of the root with\nthe least degree, and a farthest node. For all the trapping problems, we obtain\nthe analytical formulas for the average trapping time (ATT) measuring the\nefficiency of the trapping process, as well as the leading scaling of ATT. We\nshow that for all the trapping problems in the binary networks with a trap\nlocated at different nodes, the dominating scalings of ATT reach the possible\nminimum scalings, implying that the networks have optimal structure that is\nadvantageous to efficient trapping. Furthermore, we show that for trapping in\nthe weighted networks, the ATT is controlled by the weight parameter, through\nmodifying which, the ATT can behave superlinealy, linearly, sublinearly, or\nlogarithmically with the system size. This work could help improving the design\nof systems with efficient trapping process and offers new insight into control\nof trapping in complex systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Nov 2013 12:49:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-12"}

We discuss the effect of clipping\nlosses for long FFPCs and the effect of angular and lateral displacements on\nthe coupling efficiencies between cavity and fiber. Optical profilometry allows\nus to determine the radii of curvature and ellipticities of the fiber mirrors.\nFrom finesse measurements we infer a single-atom cooperativity of up to $12$\nfor FFPCs longer than $200 \\mu$m in length; comparison to cavities constructed\nwith reference substrate mirrors produced in the same coating run indicates\nthat our FFPCs have similar scattering losses.

Our unique linear Paul trap design\nprovides clearance for such a cavity and is miniaturized to shield trapped ions\nfrom the dielectric fiber mirrors. We numerically calculate the trap potential\nin the absence of fibers. In the experiment additional electrodes can be used\nto compensate distortions of the potential due to the fibers.

A small fraction of\nthese stars shows dipole modes with unexpectedly low amplitudes. The reduction\nin amplitude is more pronounced for stars with higher frequency of maximum\npower. In this work we want to characterize KIC 8561221 in order to confirm\nthat it is currently the least evolved star among this peculiar subset and to\ndiscuss several hypotheses that could help explain the reduction of the dipole\nmode amplitudes. We used Kepler short- and long-cadence data combined with\nspectroscopic observations to infer the stellar structure and dynamics of KIC\n8561221. We then discussed different scenarios that could contribute to the\nreduction of the dipole amplitudes such as a fast rotating interior or the\neffect of a magnetic field on the properties of the modes. We also performed a\ndetailed study of the inertia and damping of the modes. We have been able to\ncharacterize 37 oscillations modes, in particular, a few dipole modes above\nnu_max that exhibit nearly normal amplitudes. We have inferred a surface\nrotation period of around 91 days and uncovered the existence of a variation in\nthe surface magnetic activity during the last 4 years. As expected, the\ninternal regions of the star probed by the l = 2 and 3 modes spin 4 to 8 times\nfaster than the surface. With our grid of standard models we are able to\nproperly fit the observed frequencies. Our model calculation of mode inertia\nand damping give no explanation for the depressed dipole modes. A fast rotating\ncore is also ruled out as a possible explanation. Finally, we do not have any\nobservational evidence of the presence of a strong deep magnetic field inside\nthe star.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Nov 2013 14:55:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-17"}

In the Hall effect, differential rotation of the\nelectron fluid generates toroidal field by winding of the poloidal field. For\nthis reason, we focus on the influence of the initial choice of the electron\nangular velocity profile on the subsequent and long term magnetic evolution.\nWhereas previous simulations have generally chosen angular velocities\nincreasing outwards, corresponding to the lowest order Ohmic mode in the crust,\na more realistic choice is an angular velocity decreasing outwards,\ncorresponding to the MHD equilibrium field that is likely present at the time\nof crust formation. We find that the evolution passes through three basic\nphases. The early evolution is a response to the initial conditions. During the\nsecond phase the field consists of poloidal and toroidal components which\neventually relax to an isorotation state in which the angular velocity of the\nelectrons becomes constant along poloidal magnetic field lines, causing Hall\nevolution to saturate.

The obtained\nclosed-form analytical expressions for the flow field and effective slip length\nof the primary fluid explicitly contain the influence of the viscosities of the\ntwo fluids as well as the magnitude of the local slip, which is a function of\nthe surface geometry. They agree well with results from numerical computations\nof the full geometry. The analytical expressions allow investigating the\ninfluence of the viscous stresses inside the secondary fluid for arbitrary\ngeometries of the rectangular grooves. For classic superhydrophobic surfaces,\nthe deviations in the effective slip length compared to the case of inviscid\ngas flow are are pointed out. Another important finding with respect to an\naccurate modeling of flow over microstructured surfaces is that the local slip\nlength of a grooved surface is anisotropic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Nov 2013 15:29:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

Indeed, while the latter one should have been launched to the same\naltitude of LAGEOS (i.e. about $h_{\\rm L}=5890$ km) in an orbital plane\ndisplaced by $180$ deg with respect to that of LAGEOS ($I_{\\rm L}=110$ deg,\n$I_{\\rm L3}=70$ deg), LARES currently moves at a much smaller altitude (about\n$h_{\\rm LR}=1440$ km) and at a slightly different inclination ($I_{\\rm LR} =\n69.5$ deg). As independently pointed out in the literature by different\nauthors, the overall accuracy of a LARES-LAGEOS-LAGEOS II Lense-Thirring test\nmay be unfavorably \\textcolor{black}{impacted} by the lower altitude of LARES\nwith respect to the expected $\\approx 1%$ level claimed by Ciufolini \\textit{et\nal.} because of an enhanced sensitivity to the low-degree even zonal\ngeopotential coefficients inducing orbital precessions competing with the\nrelativistic ones. Concerning the previous tests performed with the combined\nnodes of only LAGEOS and LAGEOS II, an independent analysis recently appeared\nin the literature indirectly confirms that the total uncertainty in them is\nlikely far from being as little as $10%$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Nov 2013 14:25:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-02"}

Here we consider inhomogeneous systems in which\nwe constrain (for example) not the full matrix of correlations, but only the\ndistribution from which these correlations are drawn. In this sense, what we\nhave constructed is an inverse spin glass: rather than choosing coupling\nconstants at random from a distribution and calculating correlations, we choose\nthe correlations from a distribution and infer the coupling constants. We argue\nthat such models generate a block structure in the space of couplings, which\nprovides an explicit solution of the inverse problem. This allows us to\ngenerate a phase diagram in the space of (measurable) moments of the\ndistribution of correlations. We expect that these ideas will be most useful in\nbuilding models for systems that are nonequilibrium statistical mechanics\nproblems, such as networks of real neurons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Nov 2013 16:08:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 7 Sep 2014 12:44:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 10 Sep 2014 21:26:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-12"}

Detection of a weapon or\nfissile material smuggled in this manner is difficult because of the large\nvolume and mass available for shielding. Here I review methods for screening\ncargo containers to detect the possible presence of nuclear threats. Because of\nthe large volume of innocent international commerce, and the cost and\ndisruption of secondary screening by opening and inspection, it is essential\nthat the method be rapid and have a low false-positive rate. Shielding can\nprevent the detection of neutrons emitted spontaneously or by induced fission.\nThe two promising methods are muon tomography and high energy X-radiography.
