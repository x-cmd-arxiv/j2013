Micro-organisms with one preferential swimming\ndirection (e.g. gyrotaxis) still show significant clustering if spherical in\nshape, whereas prolate swimmers remain more uniformly distributed. Due to their\nlarge sensitivity to the local shear, these elongated swimmers react slower to\nthe action of vorticity and gravity and therefore do not have time to\naccumulate in a turbulent flow.

These fields\nrequire 3D protein structures for rational design of proteins with improved or\nnovel properties. X-ray crystallography is the most common approach even with\nits low success rate, but lately NMR based approaches have gained popularity.\nThe general approach involves a set of distance restraints used to guide a\nstructure prediction, but simple NMR triple-resonance experiments often provide\nenough structural information to predict the structure of small proteins.\nPrevious protein folding simulations that have utilised experimental data have\nweighted the experimental data and physical force field terms more or less\narbitrarily, and the method is thus not generally applicable to new proteins.\nFurthermore a complete and near error-free assignment of chemical shifts\nobtained by the NMR experiments is needed, due to the static, or deterministic,\nassignment. In this thesis I present Chemshift, a module for handling chemical\nshift assignments, implemented in the protein structure determination program\nPhaistos. This module treats both the assignment of experimental data, as well\nas the weighing compared to physical terms, in a probabilistic framework where\nno data is discarded. Provided a partial assignment of NMR peaks, the module is\nable to improve the assignment with the intension to utilise this in the\nprotein folding with little bias.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Nov 2013 16:06:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-14"}

Yet programmers prefer to\ntreat concurrent code as if it were wait-free, guaranteeing that all operations\nalways make progress. Unfortunately, designing wait-free algorithms is\ngenerally a very complex task, and the resulting algorithms are not always\nefficient. While obtaining efficient wait-free algorithms has been a long-time\ngoal for the theory community, most non-blocking commercial code is only\nlock-free.\n  This paper suggests a simple solution to this problem. We show that, for a\nlarge class of lock- free algorithms, under scheduling conditions which\napproximate those found in commercial hardware architectures, lock-free\nalgorithms behave as if they are wait-free. In other words, programmers can\nkeep on designing simple lock-free algorithms instead of complex wait-free\nones, and in practice, they will get wait-free progress.\n  Our main contribution is a new way of analyzing a general class of lock-free\nalgorithms under a stochastic scheduler. Our analysis relates the individual\nperformance of processes with the global performance of the system using Markov\nchain lifting between a complex per-process chain and a simpler system progress\nchain. We show that lock-free algorithms are not only wait-free with\nprobability 1, but that in fact a general subset of lock-free algorithms can be\nclosely bounded in terms of the average number of steps required until an\noperation completes.\n  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to analyze progress\nconditions, typically stated in relation to a worst case adversary, in a\nstochastic model capturing their expected asymptotic behavior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Nov 2013 16:39:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 Nov 2013 14:09:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-18"}

In CAC, a large\nnumber of chaotic maps can be used to perform coding, each achieving Shannon\noptimal compression performance. The exact choice of map is governed by a key.\nCAC has the effect of scrambling the intervals without making any changes to\nthe width of interval in which the codeword must lie, thereby allowing\nencryption without sacrificing any coding efficiency. In this paper, we use a\nredundancy in CAC procedure for secure multicast of videos where multiple users\nare distributed with different keys to decode same encrypted file.

We provide optimal complexity bounds\nfor imperfect-information games, and in most cases for perfect-information\ngames.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Nov 2013 18:18:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-14"}

Torres (2013) has identified 4 prime M dwarf pairs\nwith the most precise empirical determinations of masses and radii. The\nmeasured radii are consistently larger than standard stellar models predict. We\nhave previously modeled M dwarfs in the context of a criterion due to Gough &\nTayler in which magnetic fields inhibit the onset of convection according to a\nphysics-based prescription. New constraints on the models of M dwarfs are now\nprovided by measurements of lithium abundances. The key aspect of Li in terms\nof setting constraints on magnetic modeling is that Li burning starts at T =\n2.5 MK, and temperatures of just such magnitude are associated with the base of\nthe convection zone: magnetic inhibition of convective onset can shift this\nbase slightly closer to the surface, i.e. to slightly lower temperatures,\nthereby reducing the amount of Li depletion compared to a non-magnetic model.\nIn the present paper, we consider how our magneto-convection models handle the\nnew test of stellar structure provided by Li measurements. Among the prime\nsystems listed by Torres, we find that plausible magnetic models work well for\nCM Dra and YY Gem but not for CU Cnc. (The fourth system in Torres's list does\nnot yet have enough information to warrant magnetic modeling.) For CU Cnc, we\nsuggest that the observed lithium may have been accreted from a circumstellar\ndisk.

Here we\nshow that the different follicular sizes can be explained with diffusion-based\nlimitations on the thickness of the hormone-secreting granulosa layer. By\nanalysing published data on human follicular growth and granulosa cell\nexpansion during follicular maturation we find that the 4-fold increase of the\nantral follicle diameter is entirely driven by an increase in the follicular\nfluid volume, while the thickness of the surrounding granulosa layer remains\nconstant at about 45+/-10 mkm. Based on the measured kinetic constants, the\nmodel reveals that the observed fall in the gonadotropin concentration from\nperipheral blood circulation to the follicular antrum is a result of\nsequestration in the granulosa. The model further shows that as a result of\nsequestration, an increased granulosa thickness cannot substantially increase\nestradiol production but rather deprives the oocyte from gonadotropins. Larger\nanimals (with a larger blood volume) require more estradiol as produced by the\novaries to downregulate FSH-secretion in the pituitary. Larger follicle\ndiameters result in larger follicle surface areas for constant granulosa layer\nthickness. The reported increase in follicular surface area in larger species\nindeed correlates linearly both with species mass and with the predicted\nincrease in estradiol output. In summary, we propose a structural role for the\nantrum in that it determines the volume of the granulosa layer and thus the\nlevel of estrogen production.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Nov 2013 18:40:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-14"}

The DES search fields are well documented, enabling us to\ncalculate the probability of detecting objects with particular orbital\nparameters and absolute magnitudes at a randomized point in each orbit.\nGrouping objects together by dynamical class leads, we estimate the orbital\nelement distributions (a, e, i) for the largest three classes (Classical, 3:2,\nand Scattered) using maximum likelihood. Using H-magnitude as a proxy for the\nobject size, we fit a power law to the number of objects for 8 classes with at\nleast 5 detected members (246 objects).

Six dynamical classes (Scattered\nplus 5 resonances) are consistent in slope with the Classicals, though the\nabsolute number of objects is scaled. The exception to the power law relation\nare the Centaurs (non-resonant with perihelia closer than Neptune, and thus\ndetectable at smaller sizes), with alpha=0.42+/-0.02 (7.5<H<11).

Lifts have been studied as a means to efficiently\nconstruct expanders. In this work, we study lifts obtained from groups and\ngroup actions. We derive the spectrum of such lifts via the representation\ntheory principles of the underlying group. Our main results are:\n  (1) There is a constant $c_1$ such that for every $k\\geq 2^{c_1nd}$, there\ndoes not exist an abelian $k$-lift $H$ of any $n$-vertex $d$-regular base graph\nwith $H$ being almost Ramanujan (nontrivial eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix\nat most $O(\\sqrt{d})$ in magnitude).

We use this to\ndesign a quasi-polynomial time algorithm to construct almost Ramanujan\nexpanders deterministically.\n  The existence of expanding lifts in cyclic groups of order $k=2^{O(n/d^2)}$\ncan be viewed as a lower bound on the order $k_0$ of the largest abelian group\nthat produces expanding lifts. Our results show that the lower bound matches\nthe upper bound for $k_0$ (upto $d^3$ in the exponent).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Nov 2013 19:44:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 17 Dec 2016 10:39:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-20"}

The main tool we use is the\nparametrisation of the theory in terms of twistors, which has already proved\nuseful in discussing the interpretation of spin networks as the quantization of\ntwisted geometries. The classical formalism can be extended in a natural way to\nnull hypersurfaces, with the Euclidean polyhedra replaced by null polyhedra\nwith space-like faces, and SU(2) by the little group ISO(2). The main\ndifference is that the simplicity constraints present in the formalims are all\nfirst class, and the symplectic reduction selects only the helicity subgroup of\nthe little group. As a consequence, information on the shapes of the polyhedra\nis lost, and the result is a much simpler, abelian geometric picture. It can be\ndescribed by an Euclidean singular structure on the 2-dimensional space-like\nsurface defined by a foliation of space-time by null hypersurfaces. This\ngeometric structure is naturally decomposed into a conformal metric and scale\nfactors, forming locally conjugate pairs. Proper action-angle variables on the\ngauge-invariant phase space are described by the eigenvectors of the Laplacian\nof the dual graph. We also identify the variables of the phase space amenable\nto characterize the extrinsic geometry of the foliation. Finally, we quantise\nthe phase space and its algebra using Dirac's algorithm, obtaining a notion of\nspin networks for null hypersurfaces.

The key idea of the method\nis to embed the joint distribution of a multi-view latent variable into a\nreproducing kernel Hilbert space, and then the latent parameters are recovered\nusing a robust tensor power method. We establish that the sample complexity for\nthe proposed method is quadratic in the number of latent components and is a\nlow order polynomial in the other relevant parameters. Thus, our non-parametric\ntensor approach to learning latent variable models enjoys good sample and\ncomputational efficiencies. Moreover, the non-parametric tensor power method\ncompares favorably to EM algorithm and other existing spectral algorithms in\nour experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Nov 2013 20:42:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 8 Dec 2013 01:58:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-10"}

As such, the results of this survey are appropriate for both\nphenomenological population studies and for tests of theoretical population\nmodels. We have measured polarization fractions as low as $0.015$ down to $R$\nmagnitude of 17 and as low as $0.035$ down to 18 magnitude. The hypothesis that\nthe polarization fractions of gamma-ray - loud and gamma-ray - quiet blazars\nare drawn from the same distribution is rejected at the $10^{-3}$ level. We\ntherefore conclude that gamma-ray - loud and gamma-ray - quiet sources have\ndifferent optical polarization properties. This is the first time this\nstatistical difference is demonstrated in optical wavelengths. The polarization\nfraction distributions of both samples are well-described by exponential\ndistributions with averages of $\\langle p \\rangle =6.4 ^{+0.9}_{-0.8}\\times\n10^{-2}$ for gamma-ray--loud blazars, and $\\langle p \\rangle =3.2\n^{+2.0}_{-1.1}\\times 10^{-2}$ for gamma-ray--quiet blazars. The most probable\nvalue for the difference of the means is $3.4^{+1.5}_{-2.0}\\times 10^{-2}$. The\ndistribution of polarization angles is statistically consistent with being\nuniform.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Nov 2013 21:00:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 May 2014 05:54:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

In this series, the majority of the moment-bearing members order\nantiferromagnetically; YCo$_{2}$Ge$_{2}$ and LaCo$_{2}$Ge$_{2}$ are\nnon-moment-bearing. Ce is trivalent in CeCo$_{2}$Ge$_{2}$ at high temperatures,\nand exhibits an enhanced electronic specific heat coefficient due to Kondo\neffect at low temperatures.

Both\nEuCo$_{2}$Ge$_{2}$ and GdCo$_{2}$Ge$_{2}$ manifest essentially isotropic\nparamagnetic properties consistent with J = S = 7/2.

In this formalism the U-duality symmetry of\nM-theory or T-duality symmetry of Type II string theory becomes manifest upon\nextending coordinates that describe a background.\n  The effective potential of Double Field Theory is formulated only up to a\nboundary term and thus does not capture possible topological effects that may\ncome from a boundary. By introducing a generalised normal we derive a\nmanifestly duality covariant boundary term that reproduces the known\nGibbons-Hawking action of General Relativity, if the section condition is\nimposed. It is shown that the full potential can be represented as a sum of the\nscalar potential of gauged supergravity and a topological term that is a full\nderivative. The latter is conjectured to capture non-trivial topological\ninformation of the corresponding background, such as monodromy around an exotic\nbrane.\n  Next we show that the Scherk-Schwarz reduction of M-theory extended geometry\nsuccessfully reproduces known structures of maximal gauged supergravities.\nLocal symmetries of the extended space defined by a generalised Lie derivatives\nreduce to gauge transformations and lead to the embedding tensor written in\nterms of twist matrices. The scalar potential of maximal gauged supergravity\nthat follows from the effective potential is shown to be duality invariant with\nno need of section condition.

This is possible because it can be defined not only on\nsmooth geometries but also on discrete (e.g., simplicial) ones. In this paper,\nwe consider the spectral dimension of quantum states of spatial geometry\ndefined on combinatorial complexes endowed with additional algebraic data: the\nkinematical quantum states of loop quantum gravity (LQG). Preliminarily, the\neffects of topology and discreteness of classical discrete geometries are\nstudied in a systematic manner. We look for states reproducing the spectral\ndimension of a classical space in the appropriate regime. We also test the\nhypothesis that in LQG, as in other approaches, there is a scale dependence of\nthe spectral dimension, which runs from the topological dimension at large\nscales to a smaller one at short distances. While our results do not give any\nstrong support to this hypothesis, we can however pinpoint when the topological\ndimension is reproduced by LQG quantum states. Overall, by exploring the\ninterplay of combinatorial, topological and geometrical effects, and by\nconsidering various kinds of quantum states such as coherent states and their\nsuperpositions, we find that the spectral dimension of discrete quantum\ngeometries is more sensitive to the underlying combinatorial structures than to\nthe details of the additional data associated with them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Nov 2013 23:28:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Jun 2014 07:49:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-19"}

These puzzles might be resolved if the mathematical\nstructure of quantum mechanics were built up from physically interpretable\naxioms, but it is not. We propose three physically-based axioms which together\ncharacterize the simplest quantum system, namely the qubit. Our starting point\nis the class of all no-signaling theories. Each such theory can be regarded as\na family of empirical models, and we proceed to associate entropies, i.e.,\nmeasures of information, with these models. To do this, we move to phase space\nand impose the condition that entropies are real-valued. This requirement,\nwhich we call the Information Reality Principle, arises because in order to\nrepresent all no-signaling theories (including quantum mechanics itself) in\nphase space, it is necessary to allow negative probabilities (Wigner [1932]).\nOur second and third principles take two important features of quantum\nmechanics and turn them into deliberately chosen physical axioms. One axiom is\nan Uncertainty Principle, stated in terms of entropy. The other axiom is an\nUnbiasedness Principle, which requires that whenever there is complete\ncertainty about the outcome of a measurement in one of three mutually\northogonal directions, there must be maximal uncertainty about the outcomes in\neach of the two other directions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Nov 2013 02:23:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 Dec 2013 01:21:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 20 Jan 2014 23:45:24 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 9 Jul 2014 03:36:04 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 22 Jan 2015 21:20:50 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Mon, 14 Nov 2022 15:16:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-23"}

From the analysis of coronal images obtained with\nthe High Resolution Coronal Imager, first observational evidence of the\nbraiding of magnetic field lines was reported by Cirtain et al. 2013 (hereafter\nCG13). We present nonlinear force-free reconstructions of the associated\ncoronal magnetic field based on vector SDO/HMI magnetograms. We deliver\nestimates of the free magnetic energy associated to a braided coronal\nstructure. Our model results suggest (~100 times) more free energy at the\nbraiding site than analytically estimated by CG13, strengthening the\npossibility of the active-region corona being heated by field line braiding. We\nwere able to assess the coronal free energy appropriately by using vector field\nmeasurements and attribute the lower energy estimate of CG13 to the\nunderestimated (by a factor of 10) azimuthal field strength. We also quantify\nthe increase of the overall twist of a flare-related flux rope which had been\nclaimed by CG13. From our models we find that the overall twist of the flux\nrope increased by about half a turn within twelve minutes.

In this paper, we aim to track the GCE by using the 29Si/30Si ratios in\nevolved stars and tentatively relate this to presolar grain composition. We\nused the APEX telescope to detect thermal SiO isotopologue emission toward four\noxygen-rich M-type stars. Together with the data retrieved from the Herschel\nscience archive and from the literature, we were able to obtain the 29Si/30Si\nratios for a total of 15 evolved stars inferred from their optically thin 29SiO\nand 30SiO emission. These stars cover a range of masses and ages, and because\nthey do not significantly alter 29Si/30Si during their lifetimes, they provide\nexcellent probes of the ISM metallicity (or 29Si/30Si ratio) as a function of\ntime. The 29Si/30Si ratios inferred from the thermal SiO emission tend to be\nlower toward low-mass oxygen-rich stars (e.g., down to about unity for W Hya),\nand close to an interstellar or solar value of 1.5 for the higher-mass carbon\nstar IRC+10216 and two red supergiants. There is a tentative correlation\nbetween the 29Si/30Si ratios and the mass-loss rates of evolved stars, where we\ntake the mass-loss rate as a proxy for the initial stellar mass or current\nstellar age. This is consistent with the different abundance ratios found in\npresolar grains. We found that older objects (up to possibly 10 Gyr old) in our\nsample trace a previous, lower 29Si/30Si value of about 1. Material with this\nisotopic ratio is present in two subclasses of presolar grains, providing\nindependent evidence of the lower ratio. Therefore, the 29Si/30Si ratio derived\nfrom the SiO emission of evolved stars is a useful diagnostic tool for the\nstudy of the GCE and presolar grains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Nov 2013 10:27:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-15"}

In a\nprevious contribution (Lee & Stahler 2011), we determined this dynamical\nfriction force when the object's velocity was subsonic. We now extend our\nanalysis to the supersonic regime. As before, we consider small perturbations\ncreated in the gas far from the gravitating object, and thereby obtain the net\ninflux of linear momentum over a large, bounding surface. Various terms in the\nperturbation series formally diverge, necessitating an approximate treatment of\nthe flow streamlines. Nevertheless, we are able to derive exactly the force\nitself. As in the subsonic case, we find that F=Mdot*V, where Mdot is the rate\nof mass accretion onto the object and V its instantaneous velocity with respect\nto distant background gas. Our force law holds even when the object is porous\n(e.g., a galaxy) or is actually expelling mass in a wind. Quantitatively, the\nforce in the supersonic regime is less than that derived analytically by\nprevious researchers, and is also less than was found in numerical simulations\nthrough the mid 1990s.

In good cases, this\nconvolution product does restrict into a well defined convolution product on a\nsubset of the set of continuous functions and defines a convolution C* algebra\nattached to the quantale. In the last part of this article we investigate in\ndetails these attached C* algebras in the special case of an atomic topos. In\nthis situation the related Grothendieck quantale corresponds to a\nhypergroupoid. Relatively simple finiteness conditions on this hypergroupoid\nappear in order to obtain an interesting C* algebra.

In MANETs,\nnodes have dual responsibilities of forwarding and routing, that's why it needs\nunison with nodes. To sort out non-cooperation a real life behavior should be\nimplemented, so that misbehavior is nullified. In this paper, we present the\n\"Mirror Model\" that strictly enforces cooperation due to its punishment\nstrategy. Node's behavior is watched by its neighbors in PON mode, to update\nthe NPF, NPRF values for a threshold time. After the expiry of the threshold\ntime each node calculates the PFR and broadcasts its neighbors. Similarly all\nneighbors broadcasted PFR is received and processed by the node to define the\n'G' and 'BP' values. The G value is used to isolate selfish nodes from the\nrouting paths and BP denotes the amount of packets to be dropped by an honest\nnode against a selfish node in spite of its misbehavior/packet drops.\nCooperation within the neighbors, certainly result in subsiding misbehavior of\nselfish nodes, therein enhancing cooperation of the whole MANET. This model\nensures honesty and reliability in MANET because it does not eliminate a node,\nbut it behaves in the same way as the node behaved. Therefore, it justifies its\nname, after all mirrors reflects the same.

The answer may follow from the observation that in quantum theory,\nunlike in other theories, whenever there is an experiment to measure $A$\nsimultaneously with $B$, another to measure $B$ with $C$, and another to\nmeasure $A$ with $C$, there is always an experiment to measure all of them\nsimultaneously. This property implies that quantum theory satisfies a seemingly\nirrelevant restriction called the exclusivity (E) principle which,\nsurprisingly, explains the set of quantum correlations in some fundamental\nscenarios. An open problem is whether the E principle explains the maximum\nquantum violation of the Bell-CHSH inequality. Here we show experimentally that\nthe E principle imposes an upper bound to the violation of the Bell-CHSH\ninequality that matches the maximum predicted by quantum theory. For that, we\nuse the result of an independent experiment testing a specific\nnon-contextuality inequality. We perform both experiments: the Bell-CHSH\ninequality experiment on polarization entangled states of pairs of photons in\nStockholm and, to demonstrate independence, the non-contextuality inequality\nexperiment on single photons' orbital angular momentum states in Rome. The\nobserved results provide the first experimental evidence that the E principle\ndetermines the limits of quantum correlations and prove that hypothetical\nsuper-quantum violations for either experiment would violate the E principle.\nThis supports the conclusion that the E principle captures a fundamental\nlimitation of nature.

Due to a lack of these parameterizations, existing studies\nof dust coagulation have ignored the effects a hydrodynamical gas flow can have\non grain growth, even though it is often argued that the flow could\nsignificantly contribute either positively or negatively to the growth process.\n  Aims. We intend to provide a quantification of hydrodynamical effects on the\ngrowth of dust particles, such that these effects can be parameterized and\nimplemented in a dust coagulation code.\n  Methods. We numerically integrate the trajectories of small dust particles in\nthe flow of disk gas around a proto-planetesimal, sampling a large parameter\nspace in proto-planetesimal radii, headwind velocities, and dust stopping\ntimes.\n  Results. The gas flow deflects most particles away from the\nproto-planetesimal, such that its effective collisional cross section, and\ntherefore the mass accretion rate, is reduced. The gas flow however also\nreduces the impact velocity of small dust particles onto a proto-planetesimal.\nThis can be beneficial for its growth, since large impact velocities are known\nto lead to erosion. We also demonstrate why such a gas flow does not return\ncollisional debris to the surface of a proto-planetesimal.\n  Conclusions. We predict that a laminar hydrodynamical flow around a\nproto-planetesimal will have a significant effect on its growth. However, we\ncannot easily predict which result, the reduction of the impact velocity or the\nsweep-up cross section, will be more important. Therefore, we provide\nparameterizations ready for implementation into a dust coagulation code.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Nov 2013 13:33:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 Nov 2013 20:33:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-08"}

We performed\nVery Large Array observations of the radio continuum and ammonia line emission,\ncomplemented by COMICS/Subaru and Hi-GAL/Herschel images in the mid- and\nfar-infrared (IR). Our centimeter continuum maps reveal a collimated radio jet\nthat is oriented E-W and centered on the methanol maser disk, placed at the SE\nborder of a compact molecular core. The spectral index of the jet is negative,\nindicating non-thermal emission over most of the jet, except the peak close to\nthe maser disk, where thermal free-free emission is observed. We find that the\nammonia emission presents a bipolar structure consistent (on a smaller scale)\nin direction and velocity with that of the NE-SW bipolar outflow detected in\nprevious CO observations. After analyzing our previous N2H+(1-0) observations\nagain, we conclude that two scenarios are possible. In one case both the radio\njet and the ammonia emission would trace the root of the large-scale CO bipolar\noutflow. The different orientation of the jet and the ammonia flow could be\nexplained by precession and/or a non-isotropic density distribution around the\nstar. In the other case, the N2H+(1-0) and ammonia bipolarity is interpreted as\ntwo overlapping clumps moving with different velocities along the line of\nsight. The ammonia gas also seems to undergo rotation consistent with the maser\ndisk. Our IR images complemented by archival data allow us to derive a\nbolometric luminosity of about 10^4 L_sun and to conclude that most of the\nluminosity is due to the young stellar object associated with the maser disk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Nov 2013 13:34:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

More precisely, it is of fundamental interest to understand\nhow the storage, manipulation, and transmission of information utilizing\nquantum systems are influenced by the fact that these processes take place in a\nrelativistic spacetime. In particular, many studies in RQI have been focused on\nthe effects of non-uniform motion on entanglement, the main resource of quantum\ninformation protocols. Early investigations in this direction were performed in\nhighly idealized settings that prompted questions as to the practical\naccessibility of these results. To overcome these limitations it is necessary\nto consider quantum systems that are in principle accessible to localized\nobservers. In this thesis we present such a model, the rigid relativistic\ncavity, and its extensions, focusing on the effects of motion on entanglement\nand applications such as quantum teleportation. We study cavities in (1+1)\ndimensions undergoing non-uniform motion, consisting of segments of uniform\nacceleration and inertial motion of arbitrary duration that allow the involved\nvelocities to become relativistic. The transitions between segments can be\nsharp or smooth and higher dimensions can be incorporated. The primary focus\nlies in the Bogoliubov transformations of the quantum fields, real scalar\nfields or Dirac fields, confined to the cavities. The Bogoliubov\ntransformations change the particle content and the occupation of the energy\nlevels of the cavity. We show how these effects generate entanglement between\nthe modes of the quantum fields inside a single cavity for various initial\nstates. The entanglement between several cavities, on the other hand, is\ndegraded by the non-uniform motion, influencing the fidelity of tasks such as\nteleportation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Nov 2013 15:23:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 May 2014 09:03:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-06"}

Hence, the use of a Fourier transform is in the basis of\nasteroseismic studies. Nevertheless, the difficulties with the interpretation\nof the frequencies found in many stars lead us to reconsider whether Fourier\nanalysis is the most appropriate technique to identify pulsation modes. We have\nfound that the data, usually analyzed using Fourier techniques, present a\nnon-analyticity originating from the lack of connectivity of the underlying\nfunction describing the physical phenomena. Therefore, the conditions for the\nFourier series to converge are not fulfilled. In the light of these results, we\nexamine in this talk some stellar light curves from different asteroseismology\nspace missions (CoRoT, Kepler and SoHO) in which the interpretation of the data\nin terms of Fourier frequencies becomes difficult. We emphasize the necessity\nof a new interpretation of the stellar light curves in order to identify the\ncorrect frequencies of the pulsation modes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Nov 2013 15:57:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-29"}

Jansky Very Large Array (JVLA). The edge-on\ngalaxy, UGC 10288, has been observed in the B, C, and D configurations at\nL-band (1.5 GHz) and in the C and D configurations at C-band (6 GHz) in all\npolarization products. We show the first spatially resolved images in these\nbands,the first polarization images, and the first composed image at an\nintermediate frequency (4.1 GHz) which has been formed from a combination of\nall data sets.\n  A surprising new result is the presence of a strong, polarized, double-lobed\nextragalactic radio source ({\\it CHANG-ES A}) almost immediately behind the\ngalaxy and perpendicular to its disk. The core of {\\it CHANG-ES A} has an\noptical counterpart at a photometric redshift of $z_{phot}\\,=\\,0.39$; the\nsouthern radio lobe is behind the disk of UGC 10288 and the northern lobe is\nbehind the halo region. This background `probe' has allowed us to do a\npreliminary Faraday Rotation analysis of the foreground galaxy, putting limits\non the regular magnetic field and electron density in the halo of UGC 10288 in\nregions in which there is no direct detection of a radio continuum halo.\n  We have revised the flux densities of the two sources individually as well as\nthe star formation rate (SFR) for UGC 10288. UGC 10288 would have fallen well\nbelow the CHANG-ES flux density cutoff, had it been considered without the\nbrighter contribution of the background source.\n  UGC 10288 shows discrete high-latitude radio continuum features, but it does\nnot have a {\\it global} radio continuum halo. The total minimum magnetic field\nstrength at a sample position in the arc is $\\sim$ 10 $\\mu$G. Thus, this galaxy\nstill appears to be able to form substantial high latitude, localized features\nin spite of its relatively low SFR.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Nov 2013 15:08:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

A recent experimental study has shown that such lossless compression of\ndense graphs makes it easier to follow paths. However, computing optimal power\ngraphs is difficult.

In\nthis study, we propose an approach based on a quantitative evaluation of\nattributes of objects in fields of humanities, from which concepts such as\ndialectics and opposition are formally defined mathematically. As case studies,\nwe analyzed the temporal evolution of classical music and philosophy by\nobtaining data for 8 features characterizing the corresponding fields for 7\nwell-known composers and philosophers, which were treated with multivariate\nstatistics and pattern recognition methods. A bootstrap method was applied to\navoid statistical bias caused by the small sample data set, with which hundreds\nof artificial composers and philosophers were generated, influenced by the 7\nnames originally chosen. Upon defining indices for opposition, skewness and\ncounter-dialectics, we confirmed the intuitive analysis of historians in that\nclassical music evolved according to a master-apprentice tradition, while in\nphilosophy changes were driven by opposition. Though these case studies were\nmeant only to show the possibility of treating phenomena in humanities\nquantitatively, including a quantitative measure of concepts such as dialectics\nand opposition the results are encouraging for further application of the\napproach presented here to many other areas, since it is entirely generic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Nov 2013 01:18:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-19"}
