This set of\nmetallicities will be the basis for a calibration of metallicities from\ndifferent methods. The literature was searched for [Fe/H] estimates of\nindividual member stars of open clusters based on the analysis of\nhigh-resolution spectra. For comparison, we also compiled [Fe/H] estimates\nbased on spectra with low and intermediate resolution. At medium and high\nresolution, we found that differences in the analysis methods have a stronger\neffect on metallicity than quality differences in the observations. We retained\nonly highly probable cluster members and introduced a restriction on\natmospheric parameters. We combined 641 individual metallicity values for 458\nstars in 78 open clusters from 86 publications to form our final set of\nhigh-quality cluster metallicities. The photometric metallicities discussed in\nthe first paper of this series are systematically lower than the spectroscopic\nones by about 0.1 dex, and the differences show a scatter of about 0.2 dex.

Third, in order to accurately calculate the service time of an\nOBU, we introduce the steady state probability to calculate the exact time of a\nduration for back-off decrement, rather than using the traditional relative\nprobability.

Most simply stated, physical action is the product of the\nenergy and time necessary for motion. When complex systems are modeled as flow\nnetworks, this efficiency is defined as a decrease of action for one element to\ncross between two nodes, or endpoints of motion - a principle of least unit\naction. We find a connection with another principle that of most total action,\nor a tendency for increase of the total action of a system. This increase\nprovides more energy and time for minimization of the constraints to motion in\norder to decrease unit action, and therefore to increase organization. Also,\nwith the decrease of unit action in a system, its capacity for total amount of\naction increases. We present a model of positive feedback between action\nefficiency and the total amount of action in a complex system, based on a\nsystem of ordinary differential equations, which leads to an exponential growth\nwith time of each and a power law relation between the two.

One of the major tasks of graph management is\ngraph matching, which aims to find all of the subgraphs in a data graph that\nmatch a query graph. In the literature, proposals in this context are\nclassified into two different categories: graph-at-a-time, which process the\nwhole query graph at the same time, and vertex-at-a-time, which process a\nsingle vertex of the query graph at the same time. In this paper, we propose a\nnew vertex-at-a-time proposal that is based on graphlets, each of which\ncomprises a vertex of a graph, all of the immediate neighbors of that vertex,\nand all of the edges that relate those neighbors. Furthermore, we also use the\nconcept of minimum hub covers, each of which comprises a subset of vertices in\nthe query graph that account for all of the edges in that graph. We present the\nalgorithms of our proposal and describe an implementation based on XQuery and\nRDF. Our evaluation results show that our proposal is appealing to perform\ngraph matching.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Nov 2013 03:15:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-12"}

We then show how the metric operators of MTL,\nin combination with recursive definitions, can be used to specify policies to\ndetect privilege escalation, under various fine grained constraints. We present\na new algorithm, extending that of linear time temporal logic, for monitoring\nsafety policies written in our specification language. The monitor does not\nneed to store the entire history of events generated by the apps, something\nthat is crucial for practical implementations. We modified the Android OS\nkernel to allow us to insert our generated monitors modularly. We have tested\nthe modified OS on an actual device, and show that it is effective in detecting\npolicy violations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Nov 2013 06:21:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-12"}

The thermal non-equilibrium (TNE)\nmodel of prominence formation offers a theoretical framework to predict the\nthermodynamic evolution of the prominence and the surrounding corona. We\nexamine the evidence for a prominence-cavity connection by comparing the TNE\nmodel with diagnostics of dynamic extreme ultraviolet emission (EUV)\nsurrounding the prominence, specifically prominence horns. Horns are correlated\nextensions of prominence plasma and coronal plasma which appear to connect the\nprominence and cavity. The TNE model predicts that large-scale brightenings\nwill occur in the SDO/AIA 171\\AA\\ bandpass near the prominence that are\nassociated with the cooling phase of condensation formation. In our\nsimulations, variations in the magnitude of footpoint heating lead to\nvariations in the duration, spatial scale, and temporal offset between emission\nenhancements in the other EUV bandpasses. While these predictions match well a\nsubset of the horn observations, the range of variations in the observed\nstructures is not captured by the model. We discuss the implications of our\none-dimensional loop simulations for the three-dimensional time-averaged\nequilibrium in the prominence and the cavity. Evidence suggests that horns are\nlikely caused by condensing prominence plasma, but the larger question of\nwhether this process produces a density-depleted cavity requires a more tightly\nconstrained model of heating and better knowledge of the associated magnetic\nstructure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Nov 2013 08:43:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

Removing the look-ahead from a transducer, if\npossible, is technically highly challenging. For a restricted class of\ntransducers with look-ahead, namely those that are total, deterministic,\nultralinear, and bounded erasing, we present an algorithm that, for a given\ntransducer from that class, (1) decides whether it is equivalent to a total\ndeterministic transducer without look-ahead, and (2) constructs such a\ntransducer if the answer is positive. For the whole class of total\ndeterministic transducers with look-ahead we present a similar algorithm, which\nassumes that a so-called difference bound is known for the given transducer.\nThe designer of a transducer can usually also determine a difference bound for\nit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Nov 2013 10:07:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Oct 2014 10:49:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 2 Dec 2015 21:19:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-04"}

We show that planets\norbiting metal-poor stars have longer periods than those in metal-rich systems.\nThis trend is valid for masses at least from 10MEarth to 4MJup. Earth-like\nplanets orbiting metal-rich stars always show shorter periods (fewer than 20\ndays) than those orbiting metal-poor stars. We also found statistically\nsignificant evidence that very high mass giants have on average more eccentric\norbits than giant planets with lower mass.Finally, we show that the\neccentricity of planets with masses higher than 4MJup tends to be lower for\nplanets with shorter periods. Our results suggest that the planets in the P-MP\ndiagram are evolving differently because of a mechanism that operates over a\nwide range of planetary masses. This mechanism is stronger or weaker depending\non the metallicity of the respective system. One possibility is that planets in\nmetal-poor disks form farther out from their central star and/or they form\nlater and do not have time to migrate as far as the planets in metal-rich\nsystems.

When the level density is known,\nunfolding is done by using the integrated level density to transform the\neigenvalues into dimensionless variables with unit mean spacing. When it is not\nknown, as in most practical cases, one usually approximates the level staircase\nfunction by a polynomial. We here study the effect of unfolding procedure on\nthe spectral fluctuation of two systems for which the level density is known\nasymptotically. The first is a time-reversal-invariant chaotic system, which is\nmodeled in RMT by a Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE). The second is the case\nof chaotic systems in which m quantum numbers remain almost undistorted in the\nearly stage of the stochastic transition. The Hamiltonian of a system may be\nrepresented by a block diagonal matrix with m blocks of the same size, in which\neach block is a GOE. Unfolding is done once by using the asymptotic level\ndensities for the eigenvalues of the m blocks and once by representing the\nintegrated level density in terms of polynomials of different orders. We find\nthat the spacing distribution of the eigenvalues shows a little sensitivity to\nthe unfolding method. On the other hand, the variance of level number\n{\\Sigma}2(L)is sensitive to the choice of the unfolding function.

However, in clonal populations with a high mutational supply, the\npower of natural selection is expected to be limited. This is due to clonal\ninterference - the competition of clones carrying different beneficial\nmutations - which leads to the loss of many small effect mutations and fixation\nof large effect ones. If interference is abundant, then mechanisms for\nhorizontal transfer of genes, which allow the immediate combination of\nbeneficial alleles in a single background, are expected to evolve. However, the\nrelevance of interference in natural complex environments, such as the gut, is\npoorly known. To address this issue, we studied the invasion of beneficial\nmutations responsible for Escherichia coli's adaptation to the mouse gut and\ndemonstrate the pervasiveness of clonal interference. The observed dynamics of\nchange in frequency of beneficial mutations are consistent with soft sweeps,\nwhere a similar adaptive mutation arises repeatedly on different haplotypes\nwithout reaching fixation. The genetic basis of the adaptive mutations revealed\na striking parallelism in independently evolving populations. This was mainly\ncharacterized by the insertion of transposable elements in both coding and\nregulatory regions of a few genes. Interestingly in most populations, we\nobserved a complete phenotypic sweep without loss of genetic variation. The\nintense clonal interference during adaptation to the gut environment, here\ndemonstrated, may be important for our understanding of the levels of strain\ndiversity of E. coli inhabiting the human gut microbiota and of its\nrecombination rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Nov 2013 13:24:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-04"}

However, these hydrodynamical solutions may be\nunstable under corrugation of the interface. Such instability may drastically\nalter some of the cosmological consequences of the phase transition. Here, we\nstudy the hydrodynamical stability of deflagration fronts. We improve upon\nprevious studies by making a more careful and detailed analysis.

Fluid variables on each side of the wall are similar for weakly\nfirst-order phase transitions, but differ significantly for stronger phase\ntransitions. As a consequence, we find that, for large enough supercooling, any\nsubsonic wall velocity becomes unstable. Moreover, as the velocity approaches\nthe speed of sound, perturbations become unstable on all wavelengths. For\nsmaller supercooling and small wall velocities, our results agree with those of\nprevious works. Essentially, perturbations on large wavelengths are unstable,\nunless the wall velocity is higher than a critical value.

Based on the\nconservation of magnetic flux, the magnetic field changes along the axis of the\nhourglass. We adopt the result of TG08---the high-energy emission from GeV to\nTeV can be produced through inverse Compton by the two-zone system, and the\nphotons from radio to X-ray are mainly radiated by the fast inner zone system.\nHere, we only discuss the light curves of the fast inner blob from radio to\nX-ray. When a compressible blob travels down the axis of the first bulb in the\nhourglass, because of magnetic flux conservation, its cross section experiences\nan adiabatic compression process, which results in particle acceleration and\nthe brightening of HST-1. When the blob moves into the second bulb of the\nhourglass, because of magnetic flux conservation, the dimming of the knot\noccurs along with an adiabatic expansion of its cross section.

For many applications, when symmetries allow it,\nsimple models consisting of 1D or 2D representations are well suited for\nproviding a satisfying description of the problem at hand.

Although the utility of these methods in systems where the\ninteractions are described by empirical potentials is now well established,\ntheir application to ab initio molecular dynamics calculations has been limited\nby difficulties associated with splitting the ab initio potential into fast and\nslowly varying components. Here we show that such a timescale separation is\npossible using two different schemes: one based on fragment decomposition and\nthe other on range separation of the Coulomb operator in the electronic\nHamiltonian. We demonstrate for both water clusters and a solvated hydroxide\nion that multiple time-scale molecular dynamics allows for outer time steps of\n2.5 fs, which are as large as those obtained when such schemes are applied to\nempirical potentials, while still allowing for bonds to be broken and reformed\nthroughout the dynamics. This permits computational speedups of up to 4.4x,\ncompared to standard Born-Oppenheimer ab initio molecular dynamics with a 0.5\nfs time step, while maintaining the same energy conservation and accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Nov 2013 22:57:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}
