The most well-known\nmathematical model of sleep regulation, the two-process model, models the\nsleep-wake cycle by two oscillators: a circadian oscillator and a homeostatic\noscillator. An alternative, more recent, model considers the mutual inhibition\nof sleep promoting neurons and the ascending arousal system regulated by\nhomeostatic and circadian processes. Here we show there are fundamental\nsimilarities between these two models. The implications are illustrated with\ntwo important sleep-wake phenomena. Firstly, we show that in the two-process\nmodel, transitions between different numbers of daily sleep episodes occur at\ngrazing bifurcations.This provides the theoretical underpinning for numerical\nresults showing that the sleep patterns of many mammals can be explained by the\nmutual inhibition model. Secondly, we show that when sleep deprivation disrupts\nthe sleep-wake cycle, ostensibly different measures of sleepiness in the two\nmodels are closely related. The demonstration of the mathematical similarities\nof the two models is valuable because not only does it allow some features of\nthe two-process model to be interpreted physiologically but it also means that\nknowledge gained from study of the two-process model can be used to inform\nunderstanding of the mutual inhibition model. This is important because the\nmutual inhibition model and its extensions are increasingly being used as a\ntool to understand a diverse range of sleep-wake phenomena such as the design\nof optimal shift-patterns, yet the values it uses for parameters associated\nwith the circadian and homeostatic processes are very different from those that\nhave been experimentally measured in the context of the two-process model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Nov 2013 16:36:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Mar 2014 14:42:36 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 14 Jul 2014 09:15:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

The\nboard implements a Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) protocol that leverages\nupon peer-to-peer (P2P) capabilities of Fermi- and Kepler-class NVIDIA GPUs to\nobtain real zero-copy, low-latency GPU-to-GPU transfers. Finally, we report on\nthe development activities for 2013 focusing on the adoption of the latest\ngeneration 28 nm FPGAs and the preliminary tests performed on this new\nplatform.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Nov 2013 17:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Nov 2013 19:48:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

Each uses linear space and can be constructed in\nlinear time for polynomially sized alphabets. However, when it comes to\nanswering queries with worst-case deterministic time bounds, the prior does so\nin $O(m\\log|\\Sigma|)$ time, where $m$ is the query size, $|\\Sigma|$ is the\nalphabet size, and the latter does so in $O(m+\\log n)$ time, where $n$ is the\ntext size. If one wants to output all appearances of the query, an additive\ncost of $O(occ)$ time is sufficient, where $occ$ is the size of the output.\n  We propose a novel way of combining the two into, what we call, a {\\em suffix\ntray}. The space and construction time remain linear and the query time\nimproves to $O(m+\\log|\\Sigma|)$ for integer alphabets from a linear range, i.e.\n$\\Sigma \\subset \\{1,\\cdots, cn\\}$, for an arbitrary constant $c$. The\nconstruction and query are deterministic. Here also an additive $O(occ)$ time\nis sufficient if one desires to output all appearances of the query.\n  We also consider the online version of indexing, where the text arrives\nonline, one character at a time, and indexing queries are answered in tandem.\nIn this variant we create a cross between a suffix tree and a suffix list (a\ndynamic variant of suffix array) to be called a {\\em suffix trist}; it supports\nqueries in $O(m+\\log|\\Sigma|)$ time. The suffix trist also uses linear space.\nFurthermore, if there exists an online construction for a linear-space suffix\ntree such that the cost of adding a character is worst-case deterministic\n$f(n,|\\Sigma|)$ ($n$ is the size of the current text), then one can further\nupdate the suffix trist in $O(f(n,|\\Sigma|)+\\log |\\Sigma|)$ time.

Thus, even\nconventional spin-transfer torques are controlled by the relativistic\nspin-orbit coupling in these systems, and additional relativistic corrections\nto the current-induced torques and magnetization damping become important for a\ncomplete understanding of the current-driven magnetization dynamics. We\ntheoretically study the effects of reactive and dissipative homogeneous\nspin-orbit torques and anisotropic damping on the current-driven skyrmion\ndynamics in cubic chiral magnets. Our results demonstrate that spin-orbit\ntorques play a significant role in the current-induced skyrmion velocity. The\ndissipative spin-orbit torque generates a relativistic Magnus force on the\nskyrmions, whereas the reactive spin-orbit torque yields a correction to both\nthe drift velocity along the current direction and the transverse velocity\nassociated with the Magnus force. The spin-orbit torque corrections to the\nvelocity scale linearly with the skyrmion size, which is inversely proportional\nto the spin-orbit coupling. Consequently, the reactive spin-orbit torque\ncorrection can be the same order of magnitude as the non-relativistic\ncontribution. More importantly, the dissipative spin-orbit torque can be the\ndominant force that causes a deflected motion of the skyrmions if the torque\nexhibits a linear or quadratic relationship with the spin-orbit coupling. In\naddition, we demonstrate that the skyrmion velocity is determined by\nanisotropic magnetization damping parameters governed by the skyrmion size.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Nov 2013 18:22:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-05"}

The proposed $L_p$ unit receives signals from\nseveral projections of a subset of units in the layer below and computes a\nnormalized $L_p$ norm. We notice two interesting interpretations of the $L_p$\nunit. First, the proposed unit can be understood as a generalization of a\nnumber of conventional pooling operators such as average, root-mean-square and\nmax pooling widely used in, for instance, convolutional neural networks (CNN),\nHMAX models and neocognitrons. Furthermore, the $L_p$ unit is, to a certain\ndegree, similar to the recently proposed maxout unit (Goodfellow et al., 2013)\nwhich achieved the state-of-the-art object recognition results on a number of\nbenchmark datasets. Secondly, we provide a geometrical interpretation of the\nactivation function based on which we argue that the $L_p$ unit is more\nefficient at representing complex, nonlinear separating boundaries. Each $L_p$\nunit defines a superelliptic boundary, with its exact shape defined by the\norder $p$. We claim that this makes it possible to model arbitrarily shaped,\ncurved boundaries more efficiently by combining a few $L_p$ units of different\norders. This insight justifies the need for learning different orders for each\nunit in the model. We empirically evaluate the proposed $L_p$ units on a number\nof datasets and show that multilayer perceptrons (MLP) consisting of the $L_p$\nunits achieve the state-of-the-art results on a number of benchmark datasets.\nFurthermore, we evaluate the proposed $L_p$ unit on the recently proposed deep\nrecurrent neural networks (RNN).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Nov 2013 18:30:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 Nov 2013 03:32:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 12 Nov 2013 18:32:42 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 29 Jan 2014 22:55:24 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sat, 1 Feb 2014 18:17:38 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Fri, 7 Feb 2014 18:55:42 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Tue, 2 Sep 2014 00:53:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-03"}

Finding an NE in such a game is simple. However, an NE assignment\nis not stable against coordinated deviations of several jobs, while a strong\nNash equilibrium (SNE) is. We study how well an NE approximates an SNE.\n  Given any job assignment in a load balancing game, the improvement ratio (IR)\nof a deviation of a job is defined as the ratio between the pre- and\npost-deviation costs.

We argue in two stages\nthat this condition is not necessary. First, by modeling the fluctuations on\nmacroscopic scales as interference between wave packets we show that, in\naccordance with the ideas advanced by Einstein in 1917, both the behavior of\nphotons as bosons (\\ie~the intensity variance has contributions from Poisson\nand phase noise) and the van-Cittert-Zernike theorem are a consequence of\nwave-particle duality. Nevertheless, we then point out that in general the\nvariance on some macroscopic timescale $\\tau$ consists of (a) a main\ncontributing term $\\propto 1/\\tau$, plus (b) a small negative term $\\propto\n1/\\tau^2$ due to the finite size of the wave packets. If the radiation passes\nthrough a dispersive medium, this size will be enlarged well beyond its vacuum\nminimum value of $\\Delta t \\approx 1/\\Delta\\nu$, leading to a more negative (b)\nterm (while (a) remains unchanged) and hence a suppression of the variance\nw.r.t. the vacuum scenario.

We find that at a given stellar mass, there is a strong dependence\nof metallicity on over-density for star-forming satellites. Instead, for\nstar-forming centrals no correlation is found. Star-forming satellites at\ndifferent stellar masses form a tight sequence in the average overdensity -\nmetallicity plane, which covers the entire observed range of metallicities and\nstellar masses. This remarkable result appears to imply that there exists a\nuniversal evolutionary path for all star-forming satellites, regardless of\ntheir stellar masses. The strong correlation between over-density and\nmetallicity for star-forming satellites indicates that the gas inflow of\nsatellite galaxies is progressively metal-enriched in denser regions. We\ninterpret our results by employing the gas regulator model and find that the\nmetallicity of the enriched inflow of star-forming satellite galaxies strongly\nincreases with increasing over-density, largely independently of stellar mass.\nIf the metallicity of the inflow of star-forming satellites can represent the\nmetallicity of the IGM, then the implied metallicity of the IGM rises from ~\n0.01 solar metallicity in void-like environments to ~ 0.3 solar metallicity in\ncluster-like environments, in broad agreement with observations. We show that\nthe observed metallicity difference between star-forming centrals and\nstar-forming satellites becoming smaller towards high stellar masses can be\nsimply explained by the mass-independent enriched inflow, without the need to\ninvolve any mass-dependent environmental effect on metallicity.

Yet, the clustering strength\nof cold dark matter halos depends upon halo properties in addition to mass,\nsuch as formation time, an effect referred to as assembly bias. If galaxy\ncharacteristics are correlated with any of these auxiliary halo properties, the\nbasic assumption of HOD/CLF methods is violated. We estimate the potential for\nassembly bias to induce systematic errors in inferred halo occupation\nstatistics. We use halo abundance matching and age matching to construct\nfiducial mock galaxy catalogs that exhibit assembly bias as well as additional\nmock catalogs with identical HODs, but with assembly bias removed. We fit a\nparameterized HOD to the projected two-point clustering of mock galaxies in\neach catalog to assess the systematic errors induced by reasonable levels of\nassembly bias. In the absence of assembly bias, the inferred HODs generally\ndescribe the true underlying HODs well, validating the basic methodology.\nHowever, in all of the cases with assembly bias, the inferred HODs have\nsystematic errors that are statistically significant. In most cases, these\nsystematic errors cannot be identified using void statistics as auxiliary\nobservables. We conclude that the galaxy-halo relationship inferred from galaxy\nclustering should be subject to a non-negligible systematic error induced by\nassembly bias. Our work suggests that efforts to model and/or constrain\nassembly bias should be high priorities as it is a threatening source of\nsystematic error in galaxy evolution studies as well as the precision cosmology\nprogram.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Nov 2013 21:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Jul 2014 15:10:45 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 10 Feb 2015 12:38:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-11"}

To provide incentives for consumers to shift\ntheir consumption to off-peak times, the utility company charges consumers\ndifferential pricing for using power at different times of the day. Consumers\ntake into account these differential prices when deciding when and how much\npower to consume daily. Importantly, while consumers enjoy lower billing costs\nwhen shifting their power usage to off-peak times, they also incur discomfort\ncosts due to the altering of their power consumption patterns. Existing works\npropose stationary strategies for the myopic consumers to minimize their\nshort-term billing and discomfort costs. In contrast, we model the interaction\nemerging among self-interested, foresighted consumers as a repeated energy\nscheduling game and prove that the stationary strategies are suboptimal in\nterms of long-term total billing and discomfort costs. Subsequently, we propose\na novel framework for determining optimal nonstationary DSM strategies, in\nwhich consumers can choose different daily power consumption patterns depending\non their preferences, routines, and needs. As a direct consequence of the\nnonstationary DSM policy, different subsets of consumers are allowed to use\npower in peak times at a low price. The subset of consumers that are selected\ndaily to have their joint discomfort and billing costs minimized is determined\nbased on the consumers' power consumption preferences as well as on the past\nhistory of which consumers have shifted their usage previously. Importantly, we\nshow that the proposed strategies are incentive-compatible. Simulations confirm\nthat, given the same peak-to-average ratio, the proposed strategy can reduce\nthe total cost (billing and discomfort costs) by up to 50% compared to existing\nDSM strategies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Nov 2013 06:38:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-11"}

The measure required an accurate removal of the galaxies\nlight within $\\sim 200$ kpc from the center. The residual background intensity\nhas then been integrated in circular apertures to derive the average ICL\nintensity profile. The latter shows an approximate exponential decline as\nexpected from theoretical cold dark matter models. The radial profile of the\nICL over the galaxies intensity ratio (ICL fraction) is increasing with\ndecreasing radius but near the cluster center it starts to bend and then\ndecreases where the overlap of the halos of the brightest cluster galaxies\nbecomes dominant. Theoretical expectations in a simplified CDM scenario show\nthat the ICL fraction profile can be estimated from the stripped over galaxy\nstellar mass ratio in the cluster. It is possible to show that the latter\nquantity is almost independent of the properties of the individual host\ngalaxies but mainly depends on the average cluster properties. The predicted\nICL fraction profile is thus very sensitive to the assumed CDM profile, total\nmass and concentration parameter of the cluster.

The absence of electronic states of the spin down\nelectrons around the Fermi level suppresses the contribution of this spin\nchannel to the total conductivity.

This method exploits the\nSDSS' five-band sampling of emission lines in PN spectra, which results in a\ncolor signature distinct from that of other sources. Selection criteria based\non this signature can be applied to nearby galaxies in which PNe appear as\npoint sources. We applied these criteria to the whole area of M31 as scanned by\nthe SDSS, selecting 167 PN candidates that are located in the outer regions of\nM31. The spectra of 80 selected candidates were then observed with the 2.2m\ntelescope at Calar Alto Observatory. These observations and cross-checks with\nliterature data show that our method has a selection rate efficiency of about\n90%, but the efficiency is different for the different groups of PNe\ncandidates.\n  In the outer regions of M31, PNe trace different well-known morphological\nfeatures like the Northern Spur, the NGC205 Loop, the G1 Clump, etc. In\ngeneral, the distribution of PNe in the outer region 8<R<20 kpc along the minor\naxis shows the \"extended disk\" - a rotationally supported low surface\nbrightness structure with an exponential scale length of 3.21+/-0.14 kpc and a\ntotal mass of ~10^10 M_{\\sun}, which is equivalent to the mass of M33. We\nreport the discovery of three PN candidates with projected locations in the\ncenter of Andromeda NE, a very low surface brightness giant stellar structure\nin the outer halo of M31.

This implies that ``under certain conditions\" quantum laws of motion\nbecome equivalent to classical laws. One of the conditions is fairly obvious:\nthe corresponding classical action should be very large as compared with the\nPlanck's constant. But this condition is not sufficient. Suppression of effects\nof quantum interference (\"decoherence\") is the phenomenon of primary importance\nfor understanding of the Bohr's principle. Being, in essence, of quite general\nnature, this problem takes on special significance in the case of non-linear\nclassically chaotic quantum systems. Whereas the rapid decay of phase\ncorrelations is an underlying feature of the classical dynamical chaos, the\n\"quantum chaos\" by itself is not capable of destroying the quantum phase\ncoherence. Strictly speaking, any initially pure quantum state remains pure\nduring an arbitrary long unitary evolution. Basically, formation of incoherent\nmixed states (decoherence) results only from the process of preparation of a\nmixed initial state or interaction with a noisy environment. Just the\ndecoherence brigdes the quantum and classical worlds.\n  Peculiarities of the time behavior of Peres fidelity, state purity, Shanon\nand von Neumann entropies are analyzed in detail. We demonstrate the ways the\ndecoherence shows up in periodically driven systems that can be associated with\nRamsey-type interferomentry experiments with ion traps.

Theor. 44 (2012) 315102) we specifically analyze the change of\nthe adiabatic invariant (the action) of the system under a parametric kick: A\nconjecture has been put forward that the change of the action at the mean\nenergy always increases, which means, for the given statistical ensemble, that\nthe entropy in the mean increases. By means of a detailed analysis of a great\nnumber of case studies we show that the conjecture largely is satisfied, except\nif either the potential is not smooth enough, or if the energy is too close to\na stationary point of the potential (separatrix in the phase space). Very fast\nchanges in a time dependent system quite generally can be well described by\nsuch a picture and by the approximation of a parametric kick, if the change of\nthe parameter is sufficiently fast and takes place on the time scale of less\nthan one oscillation period.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Nov 2013 14:05:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 Nov 2013 07:42:46 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 18 Mar 2014 07:17:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

The line width of ~4 km/s suggests an origin of the OH+ emission\nclose to the PDR surface, at a depth of A_V ~0.3-0.5 into the cloud where most\nhydrogen is in atomic form. Steady-state collisional and radiative excitation\nmodels require unrealistically high OH+ column densities to match the observed\nline intensity, indicating that the formation of OH+ in the Bar is rapid enough\nto influence its excitation. Our best-fit OH+ column density of ~1x10^14 cm^-2\nis similar to that in previous absorption line studies, while our limits on the\nratios of OH+/H2O+ (>~40) and OH+/H3O+ (>~15) are higher than seen before.\n  The column density of OH+ is consistent with estimates from a thermo-chemical\nmodel for parameters applicable to the Orion Bar, given the current\nuncertainties in the local gas pressure and the spectral shape of the ionizing\nradiation field. The unusually high OH+/H2O+ and OH+/H3O+ ratios are probably\ndue to the high UV radiation field and electron density in this object. In the\nBar, photodissociation and electron recombination are more effective destroyers\nof OH+ than the reaction with H2, which limits the production of H2O+. The\nappearance of the OH+ lines in emission is the result of the high density of\nelectrons and H atoms in the Orion Bar, since for these species, inelastic\ncollisions with OH+ are faster than reactive ones. In addition, chemical\npumping, far-infrared pumping by local dust, and near-UV pumping by Trapezium\nstarlight contribute to the OH+ excitation. Similar conditions may apply to\nextragalactic nuclei where OH+ lines are seen in emission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Nov 2013 14:17:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

Thus, ancient astronomers could have shown that a key\nimplication of Ptolemy's model was wrong. In modern times we attribute the\nvariation of distance of the Moon to the combined effect of the ellipticity of\nthe Moon's orbit and the perturbing effect of the Sun on the Earth-Moon system.\nWe show graphically how this affects the ecliptic longitudes and radial\ndistance of the Moon.

The electrons can be injected externally or generated by\nthe cathode via field emission governed by a current-field law. The case of\nequipotential electrodes and fixed injection is studied along with a positive\nanode potential. When the current is fixed externally the approach to the\nstationary state goes without oscillations if the initial electron velocity is\nhigh enough and the anode can absorb the injected flow. Otherwise the\naccumulated space charge creates a potential barrier which reflects the flow\nand leads to its oscillations, but our method of analysis is invalid in such\nconditions. In the field emission case the flow goes to its stationary state\nthrough a train of decaying oscillations whose period is of the order of the\nelectron transit time, in agreement with earlier studies based on perturbation\ntechniques. Our approximate method does not permit very high cathode\nemissivity, though the method works when the stationary current density is only\nabout 10% smaller than the Child-Langmuir limit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Nov 2013 20:02:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}
