For the stabilization of 3-valent cerium in ceramic phosphors such as\ncalcium scandate CaSc2O4, often co-doping with sodium for charge compensation\nis performed (Na+, Ce3+ = 2 Ca2+). At the melting point of CaSc2O4 (ca. 2110\ndeg C), however, alkaline oxides evaporate completely and co-doping is thus no\noption for crystal growth from the melt. It is shown that even without\nco-doping Ce3+:CaSc2O4 crystal fibers can be grown from the melt by\nlaser-heated pedestal growth (LHPG) in a suitable reactive atmosphere. Reactive\nmeans here that the oxygen partial pressure is a function of temperature and\npO2(T) rises for this atmosphere in such a way that Ce3+ is kept stable for all\nT. Crystal fibers with ca. 1 mm diameter and up to 50 mm length were grown and\ncharacterized. Differential thermal analysis (DTA) was performed in the\npseudo-binary system CaO-Sc2O3, and the specific heat capacity cp(T) of CaSc2O4\nwas measured up to 1240 K by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Near and\nbeyond the melting point of calcium scandate significant evaporation of calcium\ntends to shift the melt composition towards the Sc2O3 side.

However, many species\nare repeatedly introduced to the same location and eventually one population\nmay overcome the Allee effect by chance. With the help of stochastic models, we\ninvestigate how much genetic diversity such successful populations harbour on\naverage and how this depends on offspring-number variation, an important source\nof stochastic variability in population size. We find that with increasing\nvariability, the Allee effect increasingly promotes genetic diversity in\nsuccessful populations. Successful Allee-effect populations with highly\nvariable population dynamics escape rapidly from the region of small population\nsizes and do not linger around the critical population size. Therefore, they\nare exposed to relatively little genetic drift. We show that here---unlike in\nclassical population genetics models---the role of offspring-number variation\ncannot be accounted for by an effective-population-size correction. Thus, our\nresults highlight the importance of detailed biological knowledge, in this case\non the probability distribution of family sizes, when predicting the\nevolutionary potential of newly founded populations or when using genetic data\nto reconstruct their demographic history.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Nov 2013 16:06:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-22"}

In our\nsetting, we allow violations of the bounds $w_j$ and we model our problem as a\nbi-criteria problem: we have two objectives to optimize namely (a) to maximize\nthe profit (maximum matching) while (b) minimizing the violation of the color\nbounds.

IC 3418 has a spectacular 17 kpc length UV-bright tail\ncomprised of knots, head-tail, and linear stellar features. The only H-alpha\nemission arises from a few HII regions in the tail, the brightest of which are\nat the heads of head-tail UV sources whose tails point toward the galaxy\n(\"fireballs\"). Several of the elongated tail sources have H-alpha peaks\noutwardly offset by 80-150 pc from the UV peaks, suggesting that gas clumps\ncontinue to accelerate through ram pressure, leaving behind streams of newly\nformed stars which have decoupled from the gas. Absorption line strengths,\nmeasured from Keck DEIMOS spectra, together with UV colors, show star formation\nstopped 300+/-100 Myr ago in the main body, and a strong starburst occurred\nprior to quenching. While neither H-alpha nor HI emission are detected in the\nmain body of the galaxy, we have detected 4x10^7 M_sun of HI from the tail with\nthe VLA. The gas consumption timescale in the tail is relatively long, implying\nthat most of the stripped gas does not form stars but joins the ICM. The\nvelocities of tail HII regions, measured from Keck LRIS spectra, extend only a\nsmall fraction of the way to the cluster velocity, suggesting that star\nformation does not happen in more distant parts of the tail. Stars in the outer\ntail have velocities exceeding the escape speed, but some in the inner tail\nshould fall back into the galaxy, forming halo streams. One likely fallback\nstream is identified.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Nov 2013 18:25:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

Within each community, customers are susceptible\nof attracting new ones, retaining old ones and/or accepting new products or\nservices through the leverage of mutual influences. The communities of users\nare smaller units, easier to grasp, and allow for example the computation of\nrole analysis -- based on the centrality of an actor within his community.\n  The problem of finding communities in static graphs has been widely studied.\nHowever, from the point of view of a telecom analyst, to be really useful, the\ndetected communities must evolve as the social graph of communications changes\nover time -- for example, in order to perform marketing actions on communities\nand track the results of those actions over time. Additionally the behaviors of\ncommunities of users over time can be used to predict future activity that\ninterests the telecom operators, such as subscriber churn or handset adoption.\nSimilary group evolution can provide insights for designing strategies, such as\nthe early warning of group churn.\n  Stability is a crucial issue: the analysis performed on a given community\nwill be lost, if the analyst cannot keep track of this community in the\nfollowing time steps. This is the particular use case that we tackle in this\npaper: tracking the evolution of communities in dynamic scenarios with focus on\nstability.\n  We propose two modifications to a widely used static community detection\nalgorithm. We then describe experiments to study the stability and quality of\nthe resulting partitions on real-world social networks, represented by monthly\ncall graphs for millions of subscribers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Nov 2013 18:27:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-22"}

In this paper,\nwe clarify this difference and show that Rayleigh quotient optimization may be\nof independent scientific interests. One major challenge of Rayleigh quotient\noptimization is that the variance of quadratic statistics involves all fourth\ncross-moments of predictors, which are infeasible to compute for\nhigh-dimensional applications and may accumulate too many stochastic errors.\nThis issue is resolved by considering a family of elliptical models. Moreover,\nfor heavy-tail distributions, robust estimates of mean vectors and covariance\nmatrices are employed to guarantee uniform convergence in estimating\nnonpolynomially many parameters, even though only the fourth moments are\nassumed. Methodologically, QUADRO is based on elliptical models which allow us\nto formulate the Rayleigh quotient maximization as a convex optimization\nproblem. Computationally, we propose an efficient linearized augmented\nLagrangian method to solve the constrained optimization problem.

In this paper a\nJones transfer matrix formalism is discussed to infer the existence of exotic\nbroken symmetry states of matter from their electrodynamic response for a full\ncomplement of possible broken symmetries including reflection, rotation,\nrotation-reflection, inversion, and time-reversal. A specific condition to\ndistinguish the case of macroscopic time-reversal symmetry breaking is\nparticularly important as in a dynamical experiment like optics, one must\ndistinguish $reciprocity$ from time-reversal symmetry as dissipation violates\nstrict time-reversal symmetry of an experiment.

The\noptical/NIR and far-IR Spitzer/Herschel colors indicate that most compact SFGs\nare heavily obscured. Nearly half (47%) host an X-ray bright AGN. In contrast,\nonly about 10% of other massive galaxies at that time host AGNs. Compact SFGs\nhave centrally-concentrated light profiles and spheroidal morphologies similar\nto quiescent galaxies, and are thus strikingly different from other SFGs. Most\ncompact SFGs lie either within the SFR-M main sequence (65%) or below (30%), on\nthe expected evolutionary path towards quiescent galaxies.

As expected, two distinct modes are detected in the TMJs while only\none mode is observed in each single film. For the TMJ grown on a sapphire\nsubstrate the FMR behavior does not significantly differ from the superposition\nof the individual spectra of the single films, allowing for concluding that the\nexchange coupling between the two magnetic layers is too small to give rise to\nobservable shifts. For TMJs grown on a Si or on a MgO substrate the resonance\nspectra reveal one mode which is nearly identical to the obtained one in the\nsingle Co film, while the other observed resonance shows a considerably smaller\nintensity and cannot be described using the magnetic parameters appropriate to\nthe single Co2MnGe film.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Nov 2013 21:34:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-30"}

A theorem of\nChatterjee states that when a centered Gaussian field admits the so-called\nsuperconcentration property, it typically attains values near its maximum on\nmultiple near-orthogonal sites, known as multiple peaks. We improve his theorem\nin two aspects: (i) the number of peaks attained by our bound is of the order\n$\\exp(c / \\sigma^2)$ (as opposed to Chatterjee's polynomial bound in\n$1/\\sigma$), where $\\sigma$ is the standard deviation of the supremum of the\nGaussian field, which is assumed to have variance at most $1$ and (ii) our\nbound need not assume that the correlations are non-negative.

Most importantly, this\nfunctional shows a marked improvement over the two-dimensional Thomas-Fermi von\nWeizs\\\"acker theory, particularly in the vicinity of the classically forbidden\nregion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Nov 2013 22:51:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-11"}

Assuming the 't Hooft\nS matrix ansatz for a gravitating region surrounded by an asymptotically flat\nspace-time we find a non-local transformation which changes the standard\ncausality requirement but is a symmetry of the unitarity condition of the S\nmatrix. This new S matrix then implies correlations between the in and out\nstates of the theory with the involvement of a third entity which in the case\nof a quantum black hole, we argue is the horizon S matrix. Such correlations\nare thus linked to preserving the unitarity of the S matrix and to the fact\nthat entangling unitary operators are nonlocal. The analysis is performed\nwithin the Bogoliubov S matrix framework by considering a spacetime consisting\nof causal complements with a boundary in between. No particular metric or\nlagrangian dynamics need be invoked even to obtain an evolution equation for\nthe full S matrix. Constraints imposed by the new causality requirement and\nimplications for the effectiveness of field theoretical descriptions and for\ncomplementarity are also discussed. We find that the tension between\ninformation preservation and complementarity may be resolved provided the full\nquantum gravity theory either through symmetries or fine tuning forbids the\noccurrence of closed time like curves of information flow. Then, even if\ncausality is violated near the horizon at any intermediate stage, a standard\ncausal ordering may be preserved for the observer away from the horizon. In the\ncontext of the black hole, the novelty of our formulation is that it appears\nwell suited to understand unitarity at any intermediate stage of black hole\nevaporation. Moreover, it is applicable generally to all theories with long\nrange correlations including the final state projection models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Nov 2013 22:58:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Mar 2014 19:43:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 12 Aug 2014 14:26:30 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 14 Aug 2014 14:11:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

Explicit time stepping schemes for\nthe IB method require solvers only for Eulerian equations, for which fast\nCartesian grid solution methods are available. Such methods are relatively\nstraightforward to develop and are widely used in practice but often require\nvery small time steps to maintain stability. Implicit-time IB methods permit\nthe stable use of large time steps, but efficient implementations of such\nmethods require significantly more complex solvers that effectively treat both\nLagrangian and Eulerian variables simultaneously. Several different approaches\nto solving the coupled Lagrangian-Eulerian equations have been proposed, but a\ncomplete understanding of this problem is still emerging. This paper presents a\ngeometric multigrid method for an implicit-time discretization of the IB\nequations. This multigrid scheme uses a generalization of box relaxation that\nis shown to handle problems in which the physical stiffness of the structure is\nvery large. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness and\nefficiency of the algorithms described herein. These tests show that using\nmultigrid as a preconditioner for a Krylov method yields improvements in both\nrobustness and efficiency as compared to using multigrid as a solver.

We assume that the transmitter is unaware of the channel\nstate information (CSI) but has a knowledge about the channel statistics. We\nconsider two scenarios with respect to the feedback received by the\ntransmitter: i) ''conventional'', one-bit feedback about the decoding\nsuccess/failure (ACK/NACK), and ii) the multi-bit feedback scheme when, on top\nof ACK/NACK, the receiver provides additional information about the state of\nthe decoder to the transmitter. In both cases, the feedback is used to allocate\n(in the case of one-bit feedback) or adapt (in the case of multi-bit feedback)\nthe power across the HARQ transmission attempts. The objective in both cases is\nthe minimization of the outage probability under long-term average and peak\npower constraints. We cast the problems into the dynamic programming (DP)\nframework and solve them for Nakagami-m fading channels. A simplified solution\nfor the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime is presented using a geometric\nprogramming (GP) approach. The obtained results quantify the advantage of the\nmulti-bit feedback over the conventional approach, and show that the power\noptimization can provide significant gains over conventional power-constant\nHARQ transmissions even in the presence of peak-power constraints.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Nov 2013 00:41:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-25"}

This graph functional\noriginated from the problem of source coding in information theory and was\nintroduced by J. K\\\"{o}rner in 1973. Although the notion of graph entropy has\nits roots in information theory, it was proved to be closely related to some\nclassical and frequently studied graph theoretic concepts. For example, it\nprovides an equivalent definition for a graph to be perfect and it can also be\napplied to obtain lower bounds in graph covering problems.\n  In this thesis, we review and investigate three equivalent definitions of\ngraph entropy and its basic properties. Minimum entropy colouring of a graph\nwas proposed by N. Alon in 1996. We study minimum entropy colouring and its\nrelation to graph entropy. We also discuss the relationship between the entropy\nand the fractional chromatic number of a graph which was already established in\nthe literature.\n  A graph $G$ is called \\emph{symmetric with respect to a functional $F_G(P)$}\ndefined on the set of all the probability distributions on its vertex set if\nthe distribution $P^*$ maximizing $F_G(P)$ is uniform on $V(G)$. Using the\ncombinatorial definition of the entropy of a graph in terms of its vertex\npacking polytope and the relationship between the graph entropy and fractional\nchromatic number, we prove that vertex transitive graphs are symmetric with\nrespect to graph entropy. Furthermore, we show that a bipartite graph is\nsymmetric with respect to graph entropy if and only if it has a perfect\nmatching. As a generalization of this result, we characterize some classes of\nsymmetric perfect graphs with respect to graph entropy. Finally, we prove that\nthe line graph of every bridgeless cubic graph is symmetric with respect to\ngraph entropy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Nov 2013 01:17:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-25"}

The cross-correlation is the\nmeasure of similarity between two waveforms or two time series and the cross\nexamination reveals localized similarities in time and scale.

We find two quiescent spells of ~30 orbital periods each\nwhere the transit depth is <0.1%, followed by relatively deep transits.\nAdditionally, we find periods of on-off behaviour where >0.5% deep transits are\nfollowed by apparently no transit at all. Apart from these isolated events we\nfind neither significant correlation between consecutive transit depths nor a\ncorrelation between transit depth and stellar intensity. We find a three-sigma\nupper limit for the secondary eclipse of 4.9*10^-5, consistent with a planet\ncandidate with a radius of less than 4600 km. Using the short cadence data we\nfind that a 1-D exponential dust tail model is insufficient to explain the\ndata. We improved our model to a 2-D, two-component dust model with an opaque\ncore and an exponential tail. Using this model we fit individual eclipses\nobserved in short cadence mode. We find an improved fit of the data,\nquantifying earlier suggestions by Budaj (2013) of the necessity of at least\ntwo components. We find that deep transits have most absorption in the tail,\nand not in a disk-shaped, opaque coma, but the transit depth and the total\nabsorption show no correlation with the tail length.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Nov 2013 09:47:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-25"}

However, the effect depends on the dijet data set used\nas well as the scale choice. We also note that conclusions may be affected by\nlimiting the pull on the data luminosity chosen by the best fit, which is\nsometimes a number of standard deviations. Finally we include the inclusive jet\ndata in a new PDF fit explicitly. This enables us to check the consistency of\nthe exact result with that obtained from the reweighting procedure.

Sensitivity analysis for stochastic systems is typically\nbased on approximating continuous derivatives with respect to model parameters\nby the mean value of samples from a finite difference scheme. Instead of using\nindependent samples the proposed algorithm reduces the variance of the\nestimator by developing a strongly correlated-\"coupled\"- stochastic process for\nboth the perturbed and unperturbed stochastic processes, defined in a common\nstate space. The novelty of our construction is that the new coupled process\ndepends on the targeted observables, e.g. coverage, Hamiltonian, spatial\ncorrelations, surface roughness, etc., hence we refer to the proposed method as\nem goal-oriented sensitivity analysis. In particular, the rates of the coupled\nContinuous Time Markov Chain are obtained as solutions to a goal-oriented\noptimization problem, depending on the observable of interest, by considering\nthe minimization functional of the corresponding variance. We show that this\nfunctional can be used as a diagnostic tool for the design and evaluation of\ndifferent classes of couplings. Furthermore the resulting KMC sensitivity\nalgorithm has an easy implementation that is based on the Bortz-Kalos-Lebowitz\nalgorithm's philosophy, where here events are divided in classes depending on\nlevel sets of the observable of interest. Finally, we demonstrate in several\nexamples including adsorption, desorption and diffusion Kinetic Monte Carlo\nthat for the same confidence interval and observable, the proposed\ngoal-oriented algorithm can be two orders of magnitude faster than existing\ncoupling algorithms for spatial KMC such as the Common Random Number approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Nov 2013 10:58:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Dec 2013 18:28:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

The prompt emission is characterized by a typical\nduration, a moderare $E_{peak}$ of the time-integrated spectrum, and strong\nhard-to-soft evolution. The high observed energy fluence yields, at z=0.984, a\nhuge isotropic-equivalent energy release $E_{iso}=(2.1\\pm0.1)\\times10^{54}$\nerg. The record-breaking energy flux observed at the peak of the short, bright,\nhard initial pulse results in an unprecedented isotropic-equivalent luminosity\n$L_{iso}=(4.7\\pm0.2)\\times10^{54}$erg s$^{-1}$. A tail of the soft gamma-ray\nemission was detected with temporal and spectral behavior typical of that\npredicted by the synchrotron forward-shock model.

Various ad-hoc veto methods to\ndeal with such line artifacts have been proposed and used in the past.

The morphology of the optical-depth maps of J1324+4048 is strikingly\nsmooth, suggestive of a foreground screen of absorbing gas. The spectra at the\nintensity peaks fit a simple free-free absorption model, with a reduced chi\nsquare ~ 2, better than a simple synchrotron self-absorption model, in which\nthe reduced chi square ~ 3.5 - 5.5. We conclude that the case for free-free\nabsorption in J1324+4048 is strong. The optical-depth maps of J0029+3457\nexhibit structure, but the morphology does not correlate with that in the\nintensity maps. The fit of the spectra at the peaks to a simple free-free\nabsorption model yields a reduced chi square ~ 1, but since the turnover is\ngradual the fit is relatively insensitive to the input parameters. We find that\nfree-free absorption by a thin amount of gas in J0029+3457 is likely, but not\ndefinitive. One compact feature in J0029+3457 has an inverted spectrum even at\nthe highest frequencies.

Within this thesis, sparsity refers to the fact that a\nvector to be estimated has only few nonzero entries. One specific field\nconcerned with sparsity constraints has become popular under the name\nCompressed Sensing (CS). Within CS, the sparsity is exploited in order to\nperform (nearly) lossless compression. Moreover, this compression is carried\nout jointly or simultaneously with the process of sensing a physical quantity.\nIn contrast to CS, one can alternatively use sparsity to enhance signal\nprocessing methods. Obviously, sparsity constraints can only improve the\nobtainable estimation performance since the constraints can be interpreted as\nan additional prior information about the unknown parameter vector which is to\nbe estimated. Our main focus will be on this aspect of sparsity, i.e., we\nanalyze how much we can gain in estimation performance due to the sparsity\nconstraints.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Nov 2013 14:50:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-25"}

This has led to the\nincreased need for mathematically informed models to understand their\nbiological significance. Standard approaches usually require knowledge of\nclonal age. We show that modelling on clone size independent of time is an\nalternative method that offers certain analytical advantages; it can help\nparameterize these models, and obtain distributions for counts of mutated or\nproliferating cells, for example. When applied to a general birth-death process\ncommon in epithelial progenitors this takes the form of a gamblers ruin\nproblem, the solution of which relates to counting Motzkin lattice paths.\nApplying this approach to mutational processes, an alternative, exact,\nformulation of the classic Luria Delbruck problem emerges. This approach can be\nextended beyond neutral models of mutant clonal evolution, and also describe\nsome distributions relating to sub-clones within a tumour. The approaches above\nare generally applicable to any Markovian branching process where the dynamics\nof different \"coloured\" daughter branches are of interest.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Nov 2013 14:51:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-25"}

We show that this approach has the essential\nability for extending quantum theory, and we do this by introducing\n\"non-Bohmian\" forms for the quantum potential.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Nov 2013 10:41:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-27"}

However, restricted to the\nrather limited conductive inks and printing strategies, the currently existing\nelectronics manufacturing tools are generally complicated, expensive, time,\nmaterial, water and energy consuming, and thus mainly restricted to the\nindustrial use. Here from an alternative way, the present article demonstrated\nfor the first time an entirely automatic printing system for personal\nelectronics manufacturing through introducing a composite liquid metal ink\ndelivery and printing mechanism to overcome the large surface tension facing\nthe solution, and integrating it with the notebook computer controlling\nalgorithm. With the developed printer, any desired electronically conductive\npatterns spanning from single wires to various complex structures like\nintegrated circuit (IC), antenna, PCB, RFID, electronic greeting cards,\ndecoration arts, classical buildings (White House, Great Wall etc.) or more\ndo-it-yourself (DIY) circuits were demonstrated to be printed out in a moment\nwith high precision. And the total cost for the whole system has reached\npersonal affordability, which is hard to offer by so far the state of the art\ntechnologies. Some fundamental fluid dynamics mechanisms related to the\nproposed tapping mode enabled reliable printing and adhesion of the liquid\nmetal electronics on the flexible substrate was systematically disclosed\nthrough theoretical interpretation and experimental measurements. This clearly\nbeyond-the-lab technology and pervasively available liquid metal printer opens\nthe way for large scale home level electronics making in the coming time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Nov 2013 08:01:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-04"}

Our purpose is to propose a model under which infinite secrecy is\ndecidable. To be specific, we first propose tree transducers which are\nexpressive enough to represent practical queries.
