By solving the London and Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert\nequations we calculate the magnetic moment induced force acting on vortices in\nferromagnetic superconductors and superconductor/ferromagnet superlattices. If\nthe vortices are driven by a dc force, magnon generation due to the Cherenkov\nresonance starts as the vortex velocity exceeds some threshold value. For an\nideal vortex lattice this leads to an anisotropic contribution to the\nresistivity and to the appearance of resonance peaks on the current voltage\ncharacteristics. For a disordered vortex array the current will exhibit a\nstep-like increase at some critical voltage.

At resonance gaps of both types of families either (i)\nperiodic orbits exist, similar to the Poincare-Birkhoff theorem for 2D maps, or\n(ii) the family may form large bends. In combination these results allow for\ndescribing the hierarchical structure of regular tori in the 4D phase space\nanalogously to the islands-around-islands hierarchy in 2D maps.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Nov 2013 16:54:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 7 Jun 2014 12:25:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-20"}

The Ansatz was tested in Gaussian\n(linear) models of surface dynamics and in non-linear models, like the\nHwa-Kardar (HK) equation [Phys. Rev.

Through the\ncombined use of Dynamic Renormalization Group analysis and direct numerical\nsimulations, we conclude that the occurrence of SA in two-dimensional surfaces\nrequires dynamics to be conserved.

The shock compresses the plasma and\naccelerates electrons to energies up to gamma(max) > 1E4 times their rest-mass\nenergy, with the value of gamma(max) determined by the direction of the\nmagnetic field relative to the shock front. The turbulence is approximated in a\ncomputer code as many cells, each with a uniform magnetic field whose direction\nis selected randomly. The density of high-energy electrons in the plasma\nchanges randomly with time in a manner consistent with the power spectral\ndensity of flux variations derived from observations of blazars. The variations\nin flux and polarization are therefore caused by continuous noise processes\nrather than by singular events such as explosive injection of energy at the\nbase of the jet. Sample simulations illustrate the behavior of flux and linear\npolarization versus time that such a model produces. The variations in\ngamma-ray flux generated by the code are often, but not always, correlated with\nthose at lower frequencies, and many of the flares are sharply peaked. The mean\ndegree of polarization of synchrotron radiation is higher and its time-scale of\nvariability shorter toward higher frequencies, while the polarization electric\nvector sometimes randomly executes apparent rotations. The slope of the\nspectral energy distribution exhibits sharper breaks than can arise solely from\nenergy losses.

On average, observational data follow model predictions, but\nwith some scatter, so that systems with the same physical parameters (age,\nmetallicity, total mass) produce a variety of integrated spectra. The fewer the\nstars in a system, the larger is the scatter. Such scatter is sometimes much\nlarger than the observational errors, reflecting its physical nature.

The issue of modelling or estimating the probability of the\nsimultaneous occurrence of such extremal pressures is now crucial from the risk\nassessment point of view. In this paper, heavy-tail modelling, widely used as a\nconservative approach to risk assessment and corresponding to a worst-case risk\nanalysis, is applied to the study of sloshing. Multivariate heavy-tailed\ndistributions are considered, with Sloshing pressures investigated by means of\nsmall-scale replica tanks instrumented with d >1 sensors. When attempting to\nfit such nonparametric statistical models, one naturally faces computational\nissues inherent in the phenomenon of dimensionality. The primary purpose of\nthis article is to overcome this barrier by introducing a novel methodology.\nFor d-dimensional heavy-tailed distributions, the structure of extremal\ndependence is entirely characterised by the angular measure, a positive measure\non the intersection of a sphere with the positive orthant in Rd. As d\nincreases, the mutual extremal dependence between variables becomes difficult\nto assess. Based on a spectral clustering approach, we show here how a low\ndimensional approximation to the angular measure may be found. The\nnonparametric method proposed for model sloshing has been successfully applied\nto pressure data. The parsimonious representation thus obtained proves to be\nvery convenient for the simulation of multivariate heavy-tailed distributions,\nallowing for the implementation of Monte-Carlo simulation schemes in estimating\nthe probability of failure. Besides confirming its performance on artificial\ndata, the methodology has been implemented on a real data set specifically\ncollected for risk assessment of sloshing in the LNG shipping industry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Nov 2013 21:10:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-03"}

The resulting extremely high radio-to-infrared flux\ndensity ratios up to several thousands were previously known only for\nHigh-redshift Radio Galaxies (HzRGs), suggesting a link between the two classes\nof object. Prior to this work, no redshift was known for any IFRS in the\nAustralia Telescope Large Area Survey (ATLAS) fields which would help to put\nIFRS in the context of other classes of object, especially of HzRGs. Aims: This\nwork aims at measuring the first redshifts of IFRS in the ATLAS fields.\nFurther, we test the hypothesis that IFRS are similar to HzRGs, as\nhigher-redshift or dust-obscured versions of these massive galaxies. Methods: A\nsample of IFRS was spectroscopically observed using the Focal Reducer and Low\nDispersion Spectrograph 2 (FORS2) at the Very Large Telescope (VLT). The data\nwere calibrated based on the Image Reduction and Analysis Facility (IRAF) and\nredshifts extracted. This information was then used to calculate rest-frame\nluminosities, and to perform the first spectral energy distribution modelling\nof IFRS based on redshifts. Results: We found redshifts of 1.84, 2.13, and\n2.76, for three IFRS, confirming the suggested high-redshift character of this\nclass of object. These redshifts as well as the resulting luminosities show\nIFRS to be similar to HzRGs. We found further evidence that fainter IFRS are at\neven higher redshifts. Conclusions: Considering the similarities between IFRS\nand HzRGs substantiated in this work, the detection of IFRS, which have a\nsignificantly higher sky density than HzRGs, increases the number of Active\nGalactic Nuclei in the early universe and adds to the problems of explaining\nthe formation of supermassive black holes shortly after the Big Bang.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Nov 2013 00:28:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Jun 2014 12:29:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 22 Jul 2014 09:33:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-05"}

Assuming non-causal knowledge of energy/data arrivals\nand channel gains, optimal transmission schemes are identified by taking into\naccount the energy cost of the processing circuitry as well as the transmission\nenergy. A constant processing cost for each active sub-channel is assumed.\nThree different system objectives are considered: i) throughput maximization,\nin which the total amount of transmitted data by a deadline is maximized for a\nbacklogged transmitter with a finite capacity battery; ii) energy maximization,\nin which the remaining energy in an infinite capacity battery by a deadline is\nmaximized such that all the arriving data packets are delivered; iii)\ntransmission completion time minimization, in which the delivery time of all\nthe arriving data packets is minimized assuming infinite size battery.

In research, emphasis has been put on\noperational space vehicles. Operational satellites typically have a relatively\ncompact shape, and hence, a low area-to-mass ratio (AMR), and are in most cases\nactively or passively attitude stabilized. This enables one to treat the orbit\nand attitude propagation as decoupled problems, and in many cases the attitude\ndynamics can be neglected completely. The situation is different for space\ndebris objects, which are in an uncontrolled attitude state. Furthermore, the\nassumption that a steady-state attitude motion can be averaged over data\nreduction intervals may no longer be valid. Additionally, a subset of the\ndebris objects have significantly high area-to-mass ratio values, resulting in\nhighly perturbed orbits, e.g. by solar radiation pressure, even if a stable AMR\nvalue is assumed. This assumption implies a steady-state attitude such that the\naverage cross-sectional area exposed to the sun is close to constant.\nTime-varying solar radiation pressure accelerations due to attitude variations\nwill result in un-modeled errors in the state propagation. This work\ninvestigates the evolution of the coupled attitude and orbit motion of HAMR\nobjects. Standardized pieces of multilayer insulation are simulated in near\ngeosynchronous orbits. It is assumed that the objects are rigid bodies and are\nin uncontrolled attitude states. The integrated effects of the Earth\ngravitational field and solar radiation pressure on the attitude motion are\ninvestigated. The light curves that represent the observed brightness\nvariations over time in a specific viewing direction are extracted. A sensor\nmodel is utilized to generate light curves with visibility constraints and\nmagnitude uncertainties as observed by a standard ground based telescope.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Nov 2013 06:20:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-03"}

Using a combination of all atom molecular dynamics and\ncoarse-grained model simulations we studied the response of adenine (A) binding\nadd and pbuE A-riboswitches to mechanical force. The two riboswitches contain a\nstructurally similar three-way junction formed by three paired helices, P1, P2,\nand P3, but carry out different functions. Using pulling simulations, with\nstructures generated in MD simulations, we show that after P1 rips the dominant\nunfolding pathway in add A-riboswitch is the rupture of P2 followed by\nunraveling of P3. In the pbuE A-riboswitch, after P1 unfolds P3 ruptures ahead\nof P2. The order of unfolding of the helices, which is in accord with single\nmolecule pulling experiments, is determined by the relative stabilities of the\nindividual helices. Our results show that the stability of isolated helices\ndetermines the order of assembly and response to force in these non-coding\nregions.

In this context, we have discovered by means of\ndensity-functional simulations that, when a sizeable spin-orbit coupling is\ncombined with ferroelectricity, such as in GeTe, one obtains novel\nmultifunctional materials - called Ferro-Electric Rashba Semi-Conductors\n(FERSC) - where, thanks to a giant Rashba spin-splitting, the spin texture is\ncontrollable and switchable via an electric field. This peculiar spin-electric\ncoupling can find a natural playground in small-gap insulators, such as\nchalcogenides, and can bring brand new assets into the field of\nelectrically-controlled semiconductor spintronics\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Nov 2013 11:53:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 7 Feb 2014 14:35:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-17"}

In most cases it is very difficult to directly determine\nthe large-deviation functions. Circumventing this necessity, I present a method\nto quantify the fluctuation spectra for arbitrary Markovian models with finite\nstate space. Under non-equilibrium conditions, current-like observables are of\nspecial interest. The space of all current-like observables has a natural\ndecomposition into orthogonal complements. Remarkably, the fluctuation spectrum\nof any observable is entirely determined by only one of these components. The\nmethod is applied to study differences of fluctuations in setups sampling the\nsame dynamics at different resolutions. Coarse graining relates these models\nand can be done in a way that preserves expectation values of observables.\nHowever, the effects of the coarse graining on the fluctuations are not\nobvious. These differences are explicitly worked out for a simple model system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Nov 2013 15:07:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-03"}

Under this model, when\ntransmitters cause interference at any of the receivers, their collided packets\nare discarded and need to be retransmitted. However, in reality, that receiver\ncan still store its analog received signal and utilize it for decoding the\npackets in the future (for example, by successive interference cancellation\ntechniques). In this work, we propose a physical layer model for wireless\npacket networks that allows for such flexibility at the receivers. We assume\nthat the transmitters will be aware of the state of the channel (i.e. when and\nwhere collisions occur, or an unintended receiver overhears the signal) with\nsome delay, and propose several coding opportunities that can be utilized by\nthe transmitters to exploit the available signal at the receivers for\ninterference management (as opposed to discarding them). We analyze the\nachievable throughput of our strategy in a canonical interference channel with\ntwo transmitter-receiver pairs, and demonstrate the gain over conventional\nschemes. By deriving an outer-bound, we also prove the optimality of our scheme\nfor the corresponding model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Nov 2013 15:25:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}
