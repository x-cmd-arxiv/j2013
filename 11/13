In the\nRandall-Sundrum model electroweak observables provide very strong bounds on the\nmass of KK modes which motivates extensions to overcome this problem. Two\nextensions are briefly discussed. One particular extension is based on the\ndeformation of the metric such that it strongly departs from the AdS_5\nstructure in the IR region while it goes asymptotically to AdS_5 in the UV\nbrane. This model has the IR brane close to a naked metric singularity (which\nis outside the physical interval) characteristic of soft-walls constructions.\nThe proximity of the singularity provides a strong wave-function\nrenormalization for the Higgs field which suppresses the T and S parameters.\nThe second class of considered extensions are based on the introduction of an\nextra gauge group in the bulk such that the custodial SU(2)_R symmetry is\ngauged and protects the T parameter. By further enlarging the bulk gauge\nsymmetry one can find models where the Higgs is identified with the fifth\ncomponent of gauge fields and for which the Higgs potential, along with the\nHiggs mass, can be dynamically determined by the Coleman-Weinberg mechanism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Nov 2013 16:12:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-18"}

The presence of a\nstrong, empirical correlation between the two gas phases is indicative of a\nfundamental relationship between them, though as yet of undetermined cause. The\ncooler filaments, originally thought to have condensed from the hot gas, could\nalso arise from a merger or the disturbance of cool circumnuclear gas by\nnuclear activity.

Our\nobservations of the filaments in four nearby cool core clusters place stringent\nupper limits (<0.1%) on the presence of emission line polarization, requiring\nthat if thermal conduction is operative, the thermal gradients are not in the\nsaturated regime.

During the MAGIC\nobservations (February to April 2011) 3C 279 was in a low state in optical,\nX-ray and gamma rays. The MAGIC observations did not yield a significant\ndetection. These upper limits are in agreement with the extrapolation of the HE\ngamma-ray spectrum, corrected for extragalactic background light absorption,\nfrom Fermi-LAT. The second part of the MAGIC observations in 2011 was triggered\nby a high activity state in the optical and gamma-ray bands. During the optical\noutburst the optical electric vector position angle rotatated of about 180\ndegrees. There was no simultaneous rotation of the 43GHz radio polarisation\nangle. No VHE gamma rays were detected by MAGIC, and the derived upper limits\nsuggest the presence of a spectral break or curvature between the Fermi-LAT and\nMAGIC bands. The combined upper limits are the strongest derived to date for\nthe source at VHE and below the level of the previously detected flux by a\nfactor 2. Radiation models that include synchrotron and inverse Compton\nemissions match the optical to gamma-ray data, assuming an emission component\ninside the broad line region (BLR) responsible for the high-energy emission and\none outside the BLR and the infrared torus causing optical and low-energy\nemission. We interpreted the optical polarisation with a bent trajectory model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Nov 2013 16:30:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Jul 2014 13:05:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 7 Jul 2014 14:21:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-16"}

The LVG analysis of H2O lines in the\nbow-shock show the presence of two gas components with different excitation\nconditions: a warm (Tkin~200-300 K) and dense (n(H2)~(1-3)x10^6 cm-3) component\nwith an assumed extent of 10\" and a compact (~2\"-5\") and hot, tenuous\n(Tkin~900-1400 K, n(H2)~10^3-10^4 cm-3) gas component, which is needed to\naccount for the line fluxes of high Eu transitions.

The computational bottleneck in\nspectral clustering is computing a few of the top eigenvectors of the\n(normalized) Laplacian matrix corresponding to the graph representing the data\nto be clustered. One way to speed up the computation of these eigenvectors is\nto use the \"power method\" from the numerical linear algebra literature.\nAlthough the power method has been empirically used to speed up spectral\nclustering, the theory behind this approach, to the best of our knowledge,\nremains unexplored. This paper provides the \\emph{first} such rigorous\ntheoretical justification, arguing that a small number of power iterations\nsuffices to obtain near-optimal partitionings using the approximate\neigenvectors. Specifically, we prove that solving the $k$-means clustering\nproblem on the approximate eigenvectors obtained via the power method gives an\nadditive-error approximation to solving the $k$-means problem on the optimal\neigenvectors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Nov 2013 17:42:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 8 Feb 2015 15:55:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 12 May 2015 14:39:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

In online systems, product\ndesigners can define how peer exposure mechanisms work: adoption behaviors can\nbe shared in a passive, automatic fashion, or occur through explicit, active\nsharing. The consequences of these mechanisms are of substantial practical and\ntheoretical interest: passive sharing may increase total peer exposure but\nactive sharing may expose higher quality products to peers who are more likely\nto adopt.\n  We examine selection effects in online sharing through a large-scale field\nexperiment on Facebook that randomizes whether or not adopters share Offers\n(coupons) in a passive manner. We derive and estimate a joint discrete choice\nmodel of adopters' sharing decisions and their peers' adoption decisions. Our\nresults show that active sharing enables a selection effect that exposes peers\nwho are more likely to adopt than the population exposed under passive sharing.\n  We decompose the selection effect into two distinct mechanisms: active\nsharers expose peers to higher quality products, and the peers they share with\nare more likely to adopt independently of product quality. Simulation results\nshow that the user-level mechanism comprises the bulk of the selection effect.\nThe study's findings are among the first to address downstream peer effects\ninduced by online sharing mechanisms, and can inform design in settings where a\nsurplus of sharing could be viewed as costly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Nov 2013 18:52:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-13"}

More precisely, we prove that a mixture with known\nidentical covariance matrices whose number of components is a polynomial of any\nfixed degree in the dimension n is polynomially learnable as long as a certain\nnon-degeneracy condition on the means is satisfied. It turns out that this\ncondition is generic in the sense of smoothed complexity, as soon as the\ndimensionality of the space is high enough. Moreover, we prove that no such\ncondition can possibly exist in low dimension and the problem of learning the\nparameters is generically hard. In contrast, much of the existing work on\nGaussian Mixtures relies on low-dimensional projections and thus hits an\nartificial barrier. Our main result on mixture recovery relies on a new\n\"Poissonization\"-based technique, which transforms a mixture of Gaussians to a\nlinear map of a product distribution. The problem of learning this map can be\nefficiently solved using some recent results on tensor decompositions and\nIndependent Component Analysis (ICA), thus giving an algorithm for recovering\nthe mixture. In addition, we combine our low-dimensional hardness results for\nGaussian mixtures with Poissonization to show how to embed difficult instances\nof low-dimensional Gaussian mixtures into the ICA setting, thus establishing\nexponential information-theoretic lower bounds for underdetermined ICA in low\ndimension. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such result in the\nliterature.

As energetic particles traverse\nmatter and electromagnetic fields, they leave marks in the form of neutral\ninteraction products. Among those, gamma rays trace interactions of nuclei that\ninelastically collide with interstellar gas, as well as of leptons that undergo\nBremsstrahlung and inverse-Compton scattering. Data collected by the Fermi\nLarge Area Telescope (LAT) are therefore telling us the story of cosmic rays\nalong their journey from sources through their home galaxies. Supernova\nremnants emerge as a notable gamma-ray source population, and older remnants\ninteracting with interstellar matter finally show strong evidence of the\npresence of accelerated nuclei. Yet the maximum energy attained by shock\naccelerators is poorly constrained. Cygnus X, a massive star-forming region\nestablished by the LAT as housing cosmic-ray sources, provides a test case to\nstudy the impact of wind-driven turbulence on the early propagation.\nInterstellar emission resulting from the large-scale propagation of cosmic rays\nin the Milky Way is revealed in unprecedented detail that challenges some of\nthe simple assumptions used for the modeling. Moreover, the cosmic-ray induced\ngamma-ray luminosities of galaxies scale quasi-linearly with their massive-\nstar formation rates, and suggests that for most systems a substantial fraction\nof energy in cosmic rays escapes into the intergalactic medium. The nuclear\nproduction models and the distribution of target gas and radiation fields, not\ndetermined precisely enough yet, are key to exploiting the full potential of\ngamma-ray data. Nevertheless, data being collected by Fermi and complementary\nobservations are bringing us ever closer to solving the cosmic-ray mystery.\n(abridged)\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Nov 2013 19:50:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-13"}

Species are treated\nas discrete evolutionary entities, even though abundant empirical evidence\nindicates that patterns of gene flow such as selfing and hybridization\nfrequently occur in plant and animal groups. Here, we allow mating behavior to\nrespond to local species composition and abundance in a data-driven\nmeta-community model of species co-existence. While individuals primarily\nout-cross, they also maintain some small capacity for selfing and\nhybridization. Mating choice is treated as a 'fuzzy' behavior, determined by an\ninteraction between intrinsic properties affecting mate choice and extrinsic\nproperties of the local community, primarily the density and availability of\nsympatric inter-fertile species. When mate choice is strongly limited, even low\nsurvivorship of selfed offspring (<10%) can prevent extinction of rare species.\nWith increasing mate choice, low hybridization success rates (~20%) maintain\ncommunity level diversity for substantially longer periods of time. Given the\nlow species densities and high diversity of tropical tree communities, the\nevolutionary costs of competition among sympatric congeneric species are\nnegligible because direct competition is infrequent. In diverse communities,\nmany species are chronically rare and thus vulnerable to stochastic extinction,\nwhich occurs rapidly if species are completely reproductively isolated. By\nincorporating fuzzy mating behavior into models of species co-existence, a more\nrealistic understanding of the extinction process can be developed. Fuzzy\nmating strategies, potentially an important mechanism for rare species to\nescape extinction and gain local adaptations, should be incorporated into\nforest management strategies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Nov 2013 20:55:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-13"}

While most eQTL\nstudies to date consider the connection between genetic variation and\nexpression in a single tissue, complex, multi-tissue data sets are now being\ngenerated by the GTEx initiative. These data sets have the potential to improve\nthe findings of single tissue analyses by borrowing strength across tissues,\nand the potential to elucidate the genotypic basis of differences between\ntissues.\n  In this paper we introduce and study a multivariate hierarchical Bayesian\nmodel (MT-eQTL) for multi-tissue eQTL analysis. MT-eQTL directly models the\nvector of correlations between expression and genotype across tissues. It\nexplicitly captures patterns of variation in the presence or absence of eQTLs,\nas well as the heterogeneity of effect sizes across tissues. Moreover, the\nmodel is applicable to complex designs in which the set of donors can (i) vary\nfrom tissue to tissue, and (ii) exhibit incomplete overlap between tissues. The\nMT-eQTL model is marginally consistent, in the sense that the model for a\nsubset of tissues can be obtained from the full model via marginalization.\nFitting of the MT-eQTL model is carried out via empirical Bayes, using an\napproximate EM algorithm. Inferences concerning eQTL detection and the\nconfiguration of eQTLs across tissues are derived from adaptive thresholding of\nlocal false discovery rates, and maximum a-posteriori estimation, respectively.\nWe investigate the MT-eQTL model through a simulation study, and rigorously\nestablish the FDR control of the local FDR testing procedure under mild\nassumptions appropriate for dependent data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Nov 2013 21:04:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 21 Dec 2013 20:17:51 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 28 Sep 2015 18:49:19 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 3 Feb 2016 14:25:32 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 7 Sep 2017 02:56:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-08"}

At all redshifts, Tdust increases with infrared luminosities\n(LIR), specific SFRs (SSFR; i.e., SFR/M*) and distances with respect to the\nmain sequence (MS) of the SFR-M* plane (i.e.,\nD_SSFR_MS=log[SSFR(galaxy)/SSFR_MS(M*,z)]). The Tdust-SSFR and Tdust-D_SSFR_MS\ncorrelations are statistically more significant than the Tdust-LIR one. While\nthe slopes of these three correlations are redshift-independent, their\nnormalizations evolve from z=0 and z~2. We convert these results into a recipe\nto derive Tdust from SFR, M* and z. The existence of a strong Tdust-D_SSFR_MS\ncorrelation provides us with information on the dust and gas content of\ngalaxies. (i) The slope of the Tdust-D__SSFR_MS correlation can be explained by\nthe increase of the star-formation efficiency (SFE; SFR/Mgas) with D_SSFR_MS as\nfound locally by molecular gas studies. (ii) At fixed D_SSFR_MS, the constant\nTdust observed in galaxies probing large ranges in SFR and M* can be explained\nby an increase or decrease of the number of star-forming regions with\ncomparable SFE enclosed in them. (iii) At high redshift, the normalization\ntowards hotter temperature of the Tdust-D_SSFR_MS correlation can be explained\nby the decrease of the metallicities of galaxies or by the increase of the SFE\nof MS galaxies. All these results support the hypothesis that the conditions\nprevailing in the star-forming regions of MS and far-above-MS galaxies are\ndifferent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Nov 2013 21:17:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

In contrast to previous work, we account for a\nstochastic turn-on time $t_i$ associated with the leading edge of a pulse\nsignaling one of the qubit states. This model is relevant to spin-qubit\nreadouts based on spin-to-charge conversion and would be generically reached in\nthe limit of large signal-to-noise ratio $r$ for several other physical\nsystems, including fluorescence-based readouts of ion-trap qubits and\nnitrogen-vacancy center spins. We derive analytical closed-form expressions for\nthe conditional probability distributions associated with the peak-signal and\nboxcar filters. For the boxcar filter, we find an asymptotic scaling of the\nsingle-shot error rate $\\varepsilon \\sim \\ln r/\\sqrt{r}$ when $t_i$ is\nstochastic, in contrast to the result $\\varepsilon \\sim \\ln r/ r$ for\ndeterministic $t_i$. Consequently, the peak-signal method outperforms the\nboxcar filter significantly when $t_i$ is stochastic, but is only marginally\nbetter for deterministic $t_i$ (a result that is consistent with the widespread\nuse of the boxcar filter for fluorescence-based readouts and the peak-signal\nfor spin-to-charge conversion). We generalize the theoretically optimal\nmaximum-likelihood method to stochastic $t_i$ and show numerically that a\nstochastic turn-on time $t_i$ will always result in a larger single-shot error\nrate. Based on this observation, we propose a general strategy to improve the\nquality of single-shot readouts by forcing $t_i$ to be deterministic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Nov 2013 23:13:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-16"}

The massive\ngauge bosons arise from massive deformation of spinor momenta, which implies\nthat the mass generation is implemented by Lorentz symmetry breaking rather\nthan the spontaneous gauge symmetry breaking. Following the notation of the\nholonomy formalism, we interpret the weak hypercharge of a left-handed fermion\ndoublet as the reciprocal of the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov (KZ) parameter $\\kappa\n= k + h^{\\vee}$ where $k$ is the level number, fixed at $k = 1$, and $h^\\vee$\nis the dual Coxeter number for $SU(2)_L$. This leads to natural distinction\nbetween quarks and leptons in terms of a weight for the representation of\n$SU(2)_L$. Physical operators of the electroweak vector bosons and fermions are\ndefined by use of Grassmann variables.

The long-term evolution of SF rates and H_alpha\nmorphologies corresponding to the distributions of star-forming regions are\nparticularly investigated for different model parameters. The principal results\nare as follows. Whether ram pressure can enhance or reduce SF depends on M_h of\ndisk galaxies and inclination angles of gas disks with respect to their orbital\ndirections for a given orbit and a given environment. For example, SF can be\nmoderately enhanced in disk galaxies with M_h=10^12 M_sun at the pericenter\npassages in a cluster with M_h=10^14 M_sun whereas it can be completely shut\ndown (`quenching') for low-mass disks with M_h=10^10 M_sun. Ram pressure can\nreduce the H_alpha-to-optical-disk-size ratios of disks and the revel of the\nreduction depends on M_h and orbits of disk galaxies for a given environment.\nDisk galaxies under strong ram pressure show characteristic H_alpha\nmorphologies such as ring-like, one-sided, and crescent-like distributions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Nov 2013 03:42:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

Radio power at 1.4 or 5 GHz, which has been used\nin many studies, can be affected by synchrotron self-absorption and free-free\nabsorption in a dense region. On the other hand, these absorption effects get\nsmaller at higher frequencies. Thus, we performed simultaneous observations at\n22 and 43 GHz using the Korean VLBI Network (KVN) radio telescope based on a\nsample of 305 AGN candidates residing in elliptical galaxies from the overlap\nbetween the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 7 and Faint Images of\nthe Radio Sky at Twenty-Centimeters (FIRST). About 37% and 22% of the galaxies\nare detected at 22 and 43 GHz, respectively. Assuming no flux variability\nbetween the FIRST and KVN observation, spectral indices were derived from FIRST\nand KVN data and we found that over 70% of the detected galaxies have flat or\ninverted spectra, implying the presence of optically thick compact regions near\nthe centres of the galaxies. Core radio power does not show a clear dependence\non black hole mass at either low (1.4 GHz) or high (22 and 43 GHz) frequencies.\nHowever, we found that the luminosity of the [OIII] $\\lambda$5007 emission line\nand the Eddington ratio correlate with radio power more closely at high\nfrequencies than at low frequencies. This suggests that radio observation at\nhigh frequencies can be an appropriate tool for unveiling the innermost region.\nIn addition, the luminosity of the [OIII] $\\lambda$5007 emission line and the\nEddington ratio can be used as a tracer of AGN activity. Our study suggests a\ncausal connection between high frequency radio power and optical properties of\nAGNs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Nov 2013 07:39:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

However, it is comparatively easier to define conditions under which a\nplanet is very likely not habitable. Finding such conditions is important as it\ncan help select, in an ensemble of potentially observable planets, which ones\nshould be observed in greater detail for characterization studies. Assuming, as\nin the Earth, that the presence of a C-cycle is a necessary condition for\nlong-term habitability, we derive, as a function of the planetary mass, a\nradius above which a planet is likely not habitable. We compute the maximum\nradius a planet can have to fulfill two constraints: surface conditions\ncompatible with the existence of liquid water, and no ice layer at the bottom\nof a putative global ocean. We demonstrate that, above a given radius, these\ntwo constraints cannot be met. We compute internal structure models of planets,\nusing a five-layer model (core, inner mantle, outer mantle, ocean, and\natmosphere), for different masses and composition of the planets (in\nparticular, the Fe/Si ratio of the planet). Our results show that for planets\nin the Super-Earth mass range (1-12 Mearth), the maximum that a planet, with a\ncomposition similar to that of the Earth, can have varies between 1.7 and 2.2\nRearth. This radius is reduced when considering planets with higher Fe/Si\nratios and taking radiation into account when computing the gas envelope\nstructure. These results can be used to infer, from radius and mass\ndeterminations using high-precision transit observations like those that will\nsoon be performed by the CHaracterizing ExOPlanet Satellite (CHEOPS), which\nplanets are very likely not habitable, and therefore which ones should be\nconsidered as best targets for further habitability studies.}\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Nov 2013 07:45:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

Via the\nJW formalism, Terhal & DiVincenzo and Knill established a relation of a unitary\nclass of these circuits to the efficient simulation of non-interacting\nfermions. We describe how the JW formalism may be used to give an efficient\nsimulation for all cases in Valiant's simulation theorem, which in particular\nincludes the case of non-interacting fermions generalised to allow arbitrary\n1-qubit gates on the first line at any stage in the circuit. Finally we give an\nexposition of how these simulation results can be alternatively understood from\nsome basic Lie algebra theory, in terms of a formalism introduced by Somma et\nal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Nov 2013 08:18:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 13 Jul 2014 08:58:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 16 Aug 2015 06:34:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-18"}

The inclusion of anharmonic effects is, however, delicate as it\nrelies on perturbation theory requiring a considerable amount of computer time,\nfast increasing with the cell size. Furthermore, perturbation theory breaks\ndown when the harmonic solution is dynamically unstable or the anharmonic\ncorrection of the phonon energies is larger than the harmonic frequencies\nthemselves.We present a stochastic implementation of the self-consistent\nharmonic approximation valid to treat anharmonicity at any temperature in the\nnon-perturbative regime. The method is based on the minimization of the free\nenergy with respect to a trial density matrix described by an arbitrary\nharmonic Hamiltonian. The minimization is performed with respect to all the\nfree parameters in the trial harmonic Hamiltonian, namely, equilibrium\npositions, phonon frequencies and polarization vectors. The gradient of the\nfree energy is calculated following a stochastic procedure. The method can be\nused to calculate thermodynamic properties, dynamical properties and anharmonic\ncorrections to the Eliashberg function of the electron-phonon coupling. The\nscaling with the system size is greatly improved with respect to perturbation\ntheory. The validity of the method is demonstrated in the strongly anharmonic\npalladium and platinum hydrides. In both cases we predict a strong anharmonic\ncorrection to the harmonic phonon spectra, far beyond the perturbative limit.\nIn palladium hydrides we calculate thermodynamic properties beyond the\nquasiharmonic approximation, while in PtH we demonstrate that the high\nsuperconducting critical temperatures at 100 GPa predicted in previous\ncalculations based on the harmonic approximation are strongly suppressed when\nanharmonic effects are included.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Nov 2013 11:23:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

A key step in the proof consists in establishing a {\\em weak\nRamanujan property} of matrix $B$. Namely, the spectrum of $B$ consists in two\nleading eigenvalues $\\rho(B)$, $\\lambda_2$ and $n-2$ eigenvalues of a lower\norder $O(n^{\\epsilon}\\sqrt{\\rho(B)})$ for all $\\epsilon>0$, $\\rho(B)$ denoting\n$B$'s spectral radius. $d$-regular graphs are Ramanujan when their second\neigenvalue verifies $|\\lambda|\\le 2 \\sqrt{d-1}$. Random $d$-regular graphs have\na second largest eigenvalue $\\lambda$ of $2\\sqrt{d-1}+o(1)$ (see\nFriedman\\cite{friedman08}), thus being {\\em almost} Ramanujan.\nErd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi graphs with average degree $d$ at least logarithmic\n($d=\\Omega(\\log n)$) have a second eigenvalue of $O(\\sqrt{d})$ (see Feige and\nOfek\\cite{Feige05}), a slightly weaker version of the Ramanujan property.\nHowever this spectrum separation property fails for sparse ($d=O(1)$)\nErd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi graphs. Our result thus shows that by constructing matrix $B$\nthrough neighborhood expansion, we regularize the original adjacency matrix to\neventually recover a weak form of the Ramanujan property.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Nov 2013 11:25:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-14"}

Boolean games have been developed as a paradigm for\nmodelling societies of agents with this type of preference. In boolean games\nagents exercise control over propositional variables and strive to achieve a\ngoal formula whose realization might require the opponents' cooperation.\nRecently, a theory of incentive engineering for such games has been devised,\nwhere an external authority steers the outcome of the game towards certain\ndesirable properties consistent with players' goals, by imposing a taxation\nmechanism on the players that makes the outcomes that do not comply with those\nproperties less appealing to them. The present contribution stems from a\ncomplementary perspective and studies, instead, how games with\nquasi-dichotomous preferences can be transformed from inside, rather than from\noutside, by endowing players with the possibility of sacrificing a part of\ntheir payoff received at a certain outcome in order to convince other players\nto play a certain strategy. Concretely we explore the properties of endogenous\ngames with goals, obtained coupling strategic games with goals, a\ngeneralization of boolean games, with the machinery of endogenous games coming\nfrom game theory. We analyze equilibria in those structures, showing the\npreconditions needed for desirable outcomes to be achieved without external\nintervention. What our results show is that endogenous games with goals display\nspecific irreducible features - with respect to what already known for\nendogenous games - which makes them worth studying in their own sake.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Nov 2013 11:31:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Nov 2013 09:48:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-15"}

Complex networks are a powerful framework for\nidentifying climate interdependencies. To further exploit the knowledge of the\nlinks uncovered via the network analysis (for, e.g., improvements in\nprediction), a good understanding of the physical mechanisms underlying these\nlinks is required.

In the connectivity of these networks we assess the influence of\ntwo main indices, NINO3.4 and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), by\ncalculating the networks from time-series where these indices were linearly\nremoved. We find that the connectivity of the forced variability network is\nheavily affected by ``El Ni\\~no'': removing the NINO3.4 index yields a general\nloss of connectivity; even teleconnections between regions far away from the\nequatorial Pacific ocean are lost, suggesting that these regions are not\ndirectly linked, but rather, are indirectly interconnected via ``El Ni\\~no'',\nparticularly on interannual time scales. On the contrary, in the internal\nvariability network (independent of sea surface temperature forcing) we find\nthat the links are significantly affected by NAO with a maximum in intra-annual\ntime scales. While the strongest non-local links found are those forced by the\nocean, we show that there are also strong teleconnections due to internal\natmospheric variability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Nov 2013 11:32:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

The physical reason is that\nthe bounce-averaged curvature is favorable for all orbits, and that trapped\nelectrons precess in the direction opposite to that in which drift waves\npropagate, thus precluding wave-particle resonance. These considerations only\ndepend on the electrostatic energy balance, and are independent of all\ngeometric properties of the magnetic field other than the maximum-$J$\ncondition.

To first order,\nclimate primarily depends on 1) The atmospheric composition and the volatile\ninventory; 2) The incident stellar flux; 3) The tidal evolution of the\nplanetary spin, which can notably lock a planet with a permanent night side.\nThe atmospheric composition and mass depends on complex processes which are\ndifficult to model: origins of volatile, atmospheric escape, geochemistry,\nphotochemistry. We discuss physical constraints which can help us to speculate\non the possible type of atmosphere, depending on the planet size, its final\ndistance for its star and the star type.

By using these external shear equations, we identify two kinds\nof continuous degeneracies which may confused double and triple lenses, i.e.\nthe continuous external shear degeneracy among triple-lens systems and the\ndouble-triple lens degeneracy. These degeneracies are particularly important in\nhigh magnification events, and thus some caution needs to be applied when one\ninfers the fraction of stars hosting multiple planets from microlensing.

Although the symmetric sum capacity is achieved by this coding\nscheme, some points in the symmetric capacity region may not be achieved. In\nthe case where the channel is a combination of linear channels, we provide a\nnecessary and sufficient condition characterizing the channels whose symmetric\ncapacity region is preserved by the polarization process. We also provide a\nsufficient condition for having a maximal loss in the dominant face.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Nov 2013 13:24:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-16"}

It has recently been\nfound that certain stellarators (quasi-isodynamic ones with maximum-$J$\ngeometry) are partly resilient to trapped-particle instabilities, because\nfast-bouncing particles tend to extract energy from these modes near marginal\nstability. In reality, stellarators are never perfectly quasi-isodynamic, and\nthe question thus arises whether they still benefit from enhanced stability.\nHere the stability properties of Wendelstein 7-X and a more quasi-isodynamic\nconfiguration, QIPC, are investigated numerically and compared with the\nNational Compact Stellarator Experiment (NCSX) and the DIII-D tokamak. In\ngyrokinetic simulations, performed with the gyrokinetic code GENE in the\nelectrostatic and collisionless approximation, ion-temperature-gradient modes,\ntrapped-electron modes and mixed-type instabilities are studied. Wendelstein\n7-X and QIPC exhibit significantly reduced growth rates for all simulations\nthat include kinetic electrons, and the latter are indeed found to be\nstabilizing in the energy budget.

This then gives a\nsimilar exposure depth in each of the 3 arms despite the fact that the UV\nchannel typically sees much less flux. We present the CCD42-C0 detectors, their\ncharacterisation, including a thorough analysis of their non-linearity, and the\nMAIA data-acquisition system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Nov 2013 14:30:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-14"}

It also provides an option for full (or partial) traceability back to\nthe entry node or even to the corresponding user when all intermediate nodes\nare cooperating.

Recent work has reinvigorated the study of\nbimetric theories of gravity and massive gravity theories. One of the most\ninteresting predictions of these theories, as well as some string theories, is\nthe subluminal speed of propagating gravitational waves. Multi-messenger\nastronomy provides a unique opportunity to put limits on the difference (either\npositive or negative) between the propagation speed of electromagnetic and\ngravitational waves from these sources. This paper considers limits from\nmulti-messenger cases across the planned measurable spectrum: first, the limits\nfrom isolated pulsars based on the current best limits from LIGO on\ngravitational wave emission, second, the limits from ultra-compact binaries\nthat will be visible to a low-frequency space-based gravitational wave\nobservatory like LISA, and third, limits from super massive black hole binaries\nusing pulsar timing arrays. The required phase comparison between the\nelectromagnetic signal and the gravitational wave signal is derived and,\nassuming a null result in that comparison, the current bounds on emission are\nused to place limits on alternative theories that exhibit propagation delays.\nObservations of the pulsars in the most sensitive range of LIGO could put an\nupper limit on the graviton mass as low as $10^{-38}\\frac{eV}{c^{2}}$ and an\nupper limit on the fractional difference between the gravitational wave and\nelectromagnetic wave speeds as low as $10^{-9}$.

Examples of such special cases are the\nHeisenberg and Ising models from condensed-matter physics.\n  In this work we characterise the complexity of this problem for all 2-local\nqubit Hamiltonians. Depending on the subset S, the problem falls into one of\nthe following categories: in P; NP-complete; polynomial-time equivalent to the\nIsing model with transverse magnetic fields; or QMA-complete. The third of\nthese classes has been shown to be StoqMA-complete by Bravyi and Hastings. The\ncharacterisation holds even if S does not contain any 1-local terms; for\nexample, we prove for the first time QMA-completeness of the Heisenberg and XY\ninteractions in this setting. If S is assumed to contain all 1-local terms,\nwhich is the setting considered by previous work, we have a characterisation\nthat goes beyond 2-local interactions: for any constant k, all k-local qubit\nHamiltonians whose terms are picked from a fixed set S correspond to problems\neither in P; polynomial-time equivalent to the Ising model with transverse\nmagnetic fields; or QMA-complete.\n  These results are a quantum analogue of Schaefer's dichotomy theorem for\nboolean constraint satisfaction problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Nov 2013 15:12:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 31 Mar 2014 14:16:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 8 Aug 2014 07:26:06 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 15 Feb 2016 17:57:32 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sun, 27 Mar 2016 10:29:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-29"}

This mix remains qualitatively the same up to z~1:\nB/T<0.1 galaxies dominate at low masses, 0.1<B/T<0.45 at intermediate masses,\nand B/T>0.45 at large masses. At z>1, the fractions of disc-dominated and\nbulgeless galaxies increase strongly, and by z~2 the era of pure disc galaxies\nis reached. Bulge-dominated galaxies acquire such a morphology, and most of\ntheir mass, following a downsizing trend. Since our results are consistent with\nmost of the recent observational studies of the morphological mix at different\nredshifts, a LCDM-based scenario of merger-driven bulge assembly does not seem\nto face critical issues.

We consider two main types of tram priority, which\nwe refer to as full and partial priority. Full tram priority is able to\nguarantee service quality even when traffic is saturated, however, it results\nin significant costs to other road users. Partial tram priority significantly\nreduces tram delays while having limited impact on other traffic, and therefore\nachieves a better result in terms of the overall network performance.

Due to the large scale nature of these\nnetworks, exhaustive enumeration of this content is computationally\nprohibitive. In this paper, we show how one can obtain content properties by\nsampling only a small fraction of vertices. We first show that when sampling is\nnaively applied, this can produce a huge bias in content statistics (i.e.,\naverage number of content duplications). To remove this bias, one may use\nmaximum likelihood estimation to estimate content characteristics. However our\nexperimental results show that one needs to sample most vertices in the graph\nto obtain accurate statistics using such a method. To address this challenge,\nwe propose two efficient estimators: special copy estimator (SCE) and weighted\ncopy estimator (WCE) to measure content characteristics using available\ninformation in sampled contents. SCE uses the special content copy indicator to\ncompute the estimate, while WCE derives the estimate based on meta-information\nin sampled vertices. We perform experiments to show WCE and SCE are cost\neffective and also ``{\\em asymptotically unbiased}''. Our methodology provides\na new tool for researchers to efficiently query content distributed in large\nscale networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Nov 2013 07:37:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-18"}

First, we address the LZ problem when one or both levels decay,\ni.e., $\\veps_j(t) \\to \\veps_j(t)-i \\Gamma_j/2$. We find that if the system\nevolves from an initial time $-T$ to a final time $+T$ such that $|\\veps_1(\\pm\nT)-\\veps_2(\\pm T)|$ is not too large, the LZ survival probability of a state $|\nj \\ra$ can {\\em increase} with increasing decay rate of the other state $|i \\ne\nj \\ra$. This surprising result occurs because the decay results in crossing of\nthe two eigenvalues of the instantaneous non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. On the\nother hand, if $|\\veps_1(\\pm T)-\\veps_2(\\pm T)| \\to \\infty$ as $T \\to \\infty$,\nthe probability is {\\em independent} of the decay rate. These results are based\non analytic solutions of the time-dependent Schr\\\"odinger equations for two\ncases: (a) the energy levels depend linearly on time, and (b) the energy levels\nare bounded and of the form $\\veps_{1,2}(t) = \\pm \\veps \\tanh (t/{\\cal T})$.\nSecond, we study LZ transitions affected by dephasing by formulating the\nLandau--Zener problem with noise in terms of a Schr\\\"{o}dinger-Langevin\nstochastic coupled set of differential equations. The LZ survival probability\nthen becomes a random variable whose probability distribution is shown to\nbehave very differently for long and short dephasing times.

These lemmas have various applications, such as (special cases)\nof Reed-Muller testing and worst-case to average-case reductions for\npolynomials. However, the transformation from \\calF to \\calF' is not\nalgorithmic for either regularity lemma. We define new notions of regularity\nfor polynomials, which are analogous to the above, but which allow for an\nefficient algorithm to compute the pseudorandom collection \\calF'. In\nparticular, when the field is of high characteristic, in polynomial time, we\ncan refine \\calF into \\calF' where every nonzero linear combination of\npolynomials in \\calF' has desirably small Gowers norm.\n  Using the algorithmic regularity lemmas, we show that if a polynomial P of\ndegree d is within (normalized) Hamming distance 1-1/|F| -\\eps of some unknown\npolynomial of degree k over a prime field F (for k < d < |F|), then there is an\nefficient algorithm for finding a degree-k polynomial Q, which is within\ndistance 1-1/|F| -\\eta of P, for some \\eta depending on \\eps. This can be\nthought of as decoding the Reed-Muller code of order k beyond the list decoding\nradius (finding one close codeword), when the received word P itself is a\npolynomial of degree d (with k < d < |F|).\n  We also obtain an algorithmic version of the worst-case to average-case\nreductions by Kaufman and Lovett. They show that if a polynomial of degree d\ncan be weakly approximated by a polynomial of lower degree, then it can be\ncomputed exactly using a collection of polynomials of degree at most d-1.
