An execution of all\nexisting test cases is the best way to re-establish this confidence. However,\nregression testing is an expensive process---there might be insufficient\nresources (e.g., time, workforce) to allow for the re-execution of all test\ncases. Regression test prioritization techniques attempt to re-order a\nregression test suite based on some criteria so that highest priority test\ncases are executed earlier.\n  In this study, we want to prioritize test cases for regression testing based\non the dependency network of faults. In software testing, it is common that\nsome faults are consequences of other faults (leading faults). Moreover,\ndependent faults can be removed if and only if the leading faults have been\nremoved. Our goal is to prioritize test cases so that test cases that exposed\nleading faults (the most central faults in the fault dependency network) in the\nsystem testing phase, are executed first in regression testing.\n  We present ComReg, a test case prioritization technique based on the\ndependency network of faults. We model a fault dependency network as a directed\ngraph and identify leading faults to prioritize test cases for regression\ntesting. We use a centrality aggregation technique which considers six network\nrepresentative centrality metrics to identify leading faults in the fault\ndependency network. We also discuss the use of fault communities to select an\narbitrary percentage of the test cases from a prioritized regression test\nsuite. We conduct a case study that evaluates the effectiveness and\napplicability of the proposed method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Nov 2013 16:15:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 25 Nov 2014 17:14:26 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 26 Nov 2014 15:50:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-27"}

The\ntrigger mechanism of EXor outbursts is still debated. One theory requires a\nclose (sub)stellar companion that perturbs the inner disk and triggers the\nonset of the outburst. Here, we study the radial velocity (RV) variations of EX\nLup, the prototype of EXors. We conducted a 5-year RV survey with HARPS and\nFEROS. We analyzed the activity of EX Lup by checking the bisector and several\nother activity indicators. We complemented the RV data with photometric\nmonitoring to look for signatures of activity or varying accretion. We found\nthat the RV of EX Lup is periodic, with stable period, semi-amplitude, and\nphase over at least four years of observations. This period is not present in\nany of the activity indicators. However, the RV of narrow metallic emission\nlines suggest the same period, but with an anti-correlating phase. The observed\nabsorption line RVs can be fitted with a Keplerian solution around a 0.6 M_Sun\ncentral star with M2 sin i = (14.7 +/- 0.7) M_Jup and eccentricity of e = 0.24.\nAlternatively, we attempted to model the observations with a cold/hot stellar\nspot as well, but the spot parameters needed to reproduce the RV semi-amplitude\nare in contradiction with the photometric variability, making the spot scenario\nunlikely. We discuss two possibilities to explain the RV data: a geometry with\ntwo accretion columns rotating with the star, and a single accretion flow\nsynchronized with the orbital motion of the hypothetical companion. In the\ncompanion scenario, the companion's mass would fall into the brown dwarf\ndesert, which, together with the unusually small separation would make EX Lup a\nunique binary system, with interesting implications on the physical mechanisms\nresponsible for triggering the outburst.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Nov 2013 16:15:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

We restrict\nour study to one-band, crystalline, weakly coupled superconductors with no\nimpurities. The thin-film substrate/vacuum interfaces are described by a simple\nasymmetric potential well and a finite quasiparticle lifetime. Boundary\nconditions are chosen to comply with the charge neutrality condition. This\nmodel provides a fair description of experimental results in ultrathin lead\nfilms: on average, the superconducting gap decreases with thickness and it is\nalways below the bulk value. Clear oscillations, remnants of the shape\nresonances, are still observed for intermediate thicknesses. For materials with\na weaker electron-phonon coupling and negligible disorder, a modest enhancement\nof superconductivity seems to be feasible. The relaxation of the charge\nneutrality condition, which is in principle justified in complex oxide\nheterostructures and other materials, would lead to a much stronger enhancement\nof superconductivity by size effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Nov 2013 18:04:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 28 Feb 2014 18:20:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 13 Jan 2016 23:05:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-15"}

Studies of dust grains in these objects can provide pivotal\ninformation on the mechanisms of planet formation. Dissimilarities in the\nspatial distribution of small (micron-size) and large (millimeter-size) dust\ngrains have recently been pointed out. Constraints on the small dust grains can\nbe obtained by imaging the distribution of scattered light at near-infrared\nwavelengths. We aim at resolving structures in the surface layer of\ntransitional disks (with particular emphasis on the inner 10 - 50 AU), thus\nincreasing the scarce sample of high resolution images of these objects. We\nobtained VLT/NACO near-IR high-resolution polarimetric differential imaging\nobservations of SAO 206462 (HD135344B). This technique allows one to image the\npolarized scattered light from the disk without any occulting mask and to reach\nan inner working angle of 0.1''. A face-on disk is detected in H and Ks bands\nbetween 0.1'' and 0.9''. No significant differences are seen between the H and\nKs images. In addition to the spiral arms, these new data allow us to resolve\nfor the first time an inner cavity for small dust grains. The cavity size\n(about 28 AU) is much smaller than what is inferred for large dust grains from\n(sub)mm observations (39 to 50 AU). The interaction between the disk and\npotential orbiting companion(s) can explain both the spiral arm structure and\nthe discrepant cavity sizes for small and large dust grains. One planet may be\ncarving out the gas (and, thus, the small grains) at 28 AU, and generating a\npressure bump at larger radii (39 AU), which holds back the large grains. We\nanalytically estimate that, in this scenario, a single giant planet (with a\nmass between 5 and 15 Jupiter masses) at 17 to 20 AU from the star is\nconsistent with the observed cavity sizes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Nov 2013 18:21:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-05"}

For instance, granting access to \"contacts\"\nand \"internet\" may be necessary for a text-messaging application to function,\neven though the user does not want contacts transmitted over the internet. To\nunderstand fine-grained application use of permissions, we need to statically\nanalyze their behavior. Even then, malware detection faces three hurdles: (1)\nanalyses may be prohibitively expensive, (2) automated analyses can only find\nbehaviors that they are designed to find, and (3) the maliciousness of any\ngiven behavior is application-dependent and subject to human judgment. To\nremedy these issues, we propose semantic-based program analysis, with a human\nin the loop as an alternative approach to malware detection. In particular, our\nanalysis allows analyst-crafted semantic predicates to search and filter\nanalysis results. Human-oriented semantic-based program analysis can\nsystematically, quickly and concisely characterize the behaviors of mobile\napplications.

Analytical solutions of the quartic\npolynomial yield numerically unstable formulations. Thus, we need to utilize a\nnumerical root finding algorithm, adding significantly to the computational\nload.

However, in this\npaper we construct explicitly canonical maps in 1T phase space (including\ntimelike components, specifically the Hamiltonian) to show that it is\nappropriate to regard various 1T-physics systems, with different Lagrangians or\nHamiltonians, as being duals of each other. This concept is similar in spirit\nto dualities discovered in more complicated examples in field theory or string\ntheory. Our approach makes it evident that such generalized dualities are\nwidespread. This suggests that, as a general phenomenon, there are hidden\nrelations and hidden symmetries that conventional 1T-physics does not capture,\nimplying the existence of a more unified formulation of physics that naturally\nsupplies the hidden information. In fact, we show that 2T-physics in\n(d+2)-dimensions is the generator of these dualities in 1T-physics in\nd-dimensions by providing a holographic perspective that unifies all the dual\n1T systems into one. The unifying ingredient is a gauge symmetry in phase\nspace.

As an illustration, we will\nprovide concrete examples of 1T-systems in classical mechanics that are solved\nanalytically for the first time via our dualities.

We\nconfirm our findings by means of a set of simulations aimed at exploring the\nrelationship between different patterns of cross-border community structures\nand the outreach index.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Nov 2013 20:21:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 2 Apr 2014 08:54:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 3 Apr 2014 13:35:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-04"}

Some works (e.g. Network Utility Maximization (NUM)) are myopic:\nthey choose actions to maximize instantaneous video quality while ignoring the\nfuture impact of these actions. Such myopic solutions are known to be inferior\nto foresighted solutions that optimize the long-term video quality.\nAlternatively, foresighted solutions such as rate-distortion optimized packet\nscheduling focus on single-user wireless video transmission, while ignoring the\nresource allocation among the users.\n  In this paper, we propose an optimal solution for performing joint\nforesighted resource allocation and packet scheduling among multiple users\ntransmitting video over a shared wireless network. A key challenge in\ndeveloping foresighted solutions for multiple video users is that the users'\ndecisions are coupled. To decouple the users' decisions, we adopt a novel dual\ndecomposition approach, which differs from the conventional optimization\nsolutions such as NUM, and determines foresighted policies. Specifically, we\npropose an informationally-decentralized algorithm in which the network manager\nupdates resource \"prices\" (i.e. the dual variables associated with the resource\nconstraints), and the users make individual video packet scheduling decisions\nbased on these prices. Because a priori knowledge of the system dynamics is\nalmost never available at run-time, the proposed solution can learn online,\nconcurrently with performing the foresighted optimization.

Despite the similarities, the vocabulary and\nresults in the two communities remain largely distinct, with limited\ncross-understanding. One of the few links is Shivers's $k$-CFA work, which has\nadvanced the concept of \"context-sensitive analysis\" and is widely known in\nboth communities.\n  Recent results indicate that the relationship between the functional and\nobject-oriented incarnations of $k$-CFA is not as well understood as thought.\nVan Horn and Mairson proved $k$-CFA for $k \\geq 1$ to be EXPTIME-complete;\nhence, no polynomial-time algorithm can exist. Yet, there are several\npolynomial-time formulations of context-sensitive points-to analyses in\nobject-oriented languages. Thus, it seems that functional $k$-CFA may actually\nbe a profoundly different analysis from object-oriented $k$-CFA. We resolve\nthis paradox by showing that the exact same specification of $k$-CFA is\npolynomial-time for object-oriented languages yet exponential- time for\nfunctional ones: objects and closures are subtly different, in a way that\ninteracts crucially with context-sensitivity and complexity. This illumination\nleads to an immediate payoff: by projecting the object-oriented treatment of\nobjects onto closures, we derive a polynomial-time hierarchy of\ncontext-sensitive CFAs for functional programs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Nov 2013 23:59:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-19"}

One component exhibits a sawtooth-like\nvelocity waveform while the other is nearly sinusoidal. One method of\ngenerating such a hybrid is presented: a nonlinear model is developed for the\nfirst overtone mode, which, if excited to large amplitude, is found to drop\nstrongly in frequency and become highly non-sinusoidal. If the frequency drops\nsufficiently to become equal to the fundamental frequency, the two can become\nphase locked and form the desired hybrid. A relationship is assumed between the\nhybrid mode velocity and the observed light curve, which is approximated as a\npower series. An accurate fit of the hybrid model is made to actual Kepler data\nfor RR Lyr. The sinusoidal component may tend to stabilize the period of the\nhybrid which is found in real Blazhko data to be extremely stable.

In that case, the jet-head advance speed of the\nrestarted jet is significantly higher than the initial jet-head.

The\nwellposedness of this PDE model is established by means of constructing for it\na nonstandard semigroup generator representation; this representation is\nessentially accomplished by an appropriate elimination of the pressure. This\ncoupled PDE model involves the Stokes system which evolves on a three\ndimensional domain $\\mathcal{O}$ being coupled to a fourth order plate\nequation, possibly with rotational inertia parameter $\\rho >0$, which evolves\non a flat portion $\\Omega$ of the boundary of $\\mathcal{O}$. The coupling on\n$\\Omega$ is implemented via the Dirichlet trace of the Stokes system fluid\nvariable - and so the no-slip condition is necessarily not in play - and via\nthe Dirichlet boundary trace of the pressure, which essentially acts as a\nforcing term on this elastic portion of the boundary. We note here that\ninasmuch as the Stokes fluid velocity does not vanish on $\\Omega$, the pressure\nvariable cannot be eliminated by the classic Leray projector; instead, the\npressure is identified as the solution of a certain elliptic boundary value\nproblem.

The solution of this model in the\nmean-field Hartree-Fock approximation with the relativistic spin-orbit coupling\ntypically gives us a distribution of the local orbital magnetic moments, which\nare related to the site-diagonal part of the density matrix $\\hat{\\cal D}$ by\nthe \"standard\" expression $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}^0 = - \\mu_{\\rm B} \\mathrm{Tr} \\{\n\\hat{\\textbf{L}} \\hat{\\cal D} \\}$ and which are usually well quenched by the\ncrystal field. In this work, we evaluate \"itinerant\" corrections $\\Delta\n\\boldsymbol{\\cal M}$ to the net FM moment, suggested by the modern theory. We\nshow that these corrections are small and in most cases can be neglected.\nNevertheless, the most interesting aspect of our analysis is that, even for\nthese compounds, which are typically regarded as normal Mott insulators, the\n\"itinerant\" corrections reveal a strong $\\textbf{k}$-dependence in the\nreciprocal space, following the behavior of Chern invariants. Therefore, the\nsmall value of $\\Delta \\boldsymbol{\\cal M}$ is the result of strong cancelation\nof relatively large contributions, coming from different parts of the Brillouin\nzone. We discuss details as well as possible implications of this cancelation,\nwhich depends on the crystal structure as well as the type of the magnetic\nground state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Nov 2013 04:38:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-04"}

The architecture should enable dynamic\nupdates when new IoT devices are incorporated into Internet, and changes are\nmade to the existing ones. Nowadays in Internet, the most used discovery\narchitecture is the Domain Name System (DNS). DNS offers a scalable solution\nthrough two distributed mechanisms: multicast DNS (mDNS) and DNS Service\nDirectory (DNS-SD). Both mechanisms have been applied to discover resources and\nservices in local IoT domains. However, a full architecture has not still been\ndesigned to support global discovery, local directories and a search engine for\nubiquitous IoT domains.

Moreover, a positive\ncorrelation is found between the abundances of HCO$^+$ and HNC, and between\nthose of HNC and HCN. The HCN and HNC abundances also appear to increase as a\nfunction of the N$_2$H$^+$ abundance. The HNC/HCN and N$_2$H$^+$/HNC abundance\nratios are derived to be ~1 on average, while that of HC$_3$N/HCN is ~10%. The\nN$_2$H$^+$/HNC ratio appears to increase as the clump evolves, while the\nHNC/HCO$^+$ ratio shows the opposite behaviour. The detected SiO emission is\nlikely caused by outflow shocks in most cases, although shocks resulting from\nthe cloud formation process could also play a role.

In this paper, we consider the block fading bidirectional relay\nchannel and propose efficient transmission strategies that exploit the block\nfading property of the channel. Thereby, we consider a decode-and-forward relay\nand assume that a direct link between the two users is not present. Our aim is\nto characterize the long-term achievable rate region and to develop protocols\nwhich achieve all points of the obtained rate region. Specifically, in the\nbidirectional relay channel, there exist six possible transmission modes: four\npoint-to-point modes (user 1-to-relay, user 2-to-relay, relay-to-user 1,\nrelay-to-user 2), a multiple-access mode (both users to the relay), and a\nbroadcast mode (the relay to both users). Most existing protocols assume a\nfixed schedule for using a subset of the aforementioned transmission modes.\nMotivated by this limitation, we develop protocols which are not restricted to\nadhere to a predefined schedule for using the transmission modes. In fact,\nbased on the instantaneous channel state information (CSI) of the involved\nlinks, the proposed protocol selects the optimal transmission mode in each time\nslot to maximize the long-term achievable rate region. Thereby, we consider two\ndifferent types of transmit power constraints: 1) a joint long-term power\nconstraint for all nodes, and 2) a fixed transmit power for each node.\nFurthermore, to enable the use of a non-predefined schedule for transmission\nmode selection, the relay has to be equipped with two buffers for storage of\nthe information received from both users. As data buffering increases the\nend-to-end delay, we consider both delay-unconstrained and delay-constrained\ntransmission in the paper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Nov 2013 09:47:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

(2012) to test the standard synchrotron shock model. The\nevolution of the radio and optical afterglow, with its prominent optical\nrebrightening at t_rest 260-2600 s, is remarkably well modelled by a\ndecelerating jet viewed close to the jet edge, combined with some early\nre-energization of the shock. We thus constrain the geometry of the jet with\nhalf-opening and viewing angles of 23 and 21 deg respectively and suggest that\nwide jets viewed off-axis are more common in GRBs than previously thought. We\nalso derive the fireball microphysics parameters epsilon_B=2.4e-4 and\nepsilon_e=9.3e-2 and a circumburst density of n=240 cm^-3. The ability to\nself-consistently model the microphysics parameters and jet geometry in this\nway offers an alternative to trying to identify elusive canonical jet breaks at\nlate times. The mismatch between the observed and model-predicted X-ray fluxes\nis explained by the local rather than the global cooling approximation in the\nsynchrotron radiation model, constraining the microphysics of particle\nacceleration taking place in a relativistic shock and, in turn, emphasising the\nneed for a more realistic treatment of cooling in future developments of\ntheoretical models. Finally, our interpretation of the optical peak as due to\nthe passage of the forward shock synchrotron frequency highlights the\nimportance of high quality multi-band data to prevent some optical peaks from\nbeing erroneously attributed to the onset of fireball deceleration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Nov 2013 11:29:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-04"}

Posynomial models are\nwidely used in various engineering design endeavors, such as circuits,\naerospace and structural design, mainly due to the fact that design problems\ncast in terms of posynomial objectives and constraints can be solved\nefficiently by means of a convex optimization technique known as geometric\nprogramming (GP). However, while quite a vast literature exists on GP-based\ndesign, very few contributions can yet be found on the problem of identifying\nposynomial models from experimental data. Posynomial identification amounts to\ndetermining not only the coefficients of the combination, but also the\nexponents in the monomials, which renders the identification problem\nnumerically hard. In this draft, we propose an approach to the identification\nof multivariate posynomial models, based on the expansion on a given\nlarge-scale basis of monomials. The model is then identified by seeking\ncoefficients of the combination that minimize a mixed objective, composed by a\nterm representing the fitting error and a term inducing sparsity in the\nrepresentation, which results in a problem formulation of the ``square-root\nLASSO'' type, with nonnegativity constraints on the variables.

Since the $Z_2$\nparity is broken the two doublets can mix, which leads to a distinct and novel\nphenomenology. This Stealth Doublet Model can be seen as a generalization of\nthe Inert Doublet Model with a broken $Z_2$ symmetry.

To provide\nthe first unambiguous observational detection of pulsations in this class of\nchemically peculiar objects, the bright star HD 45975 was monitored for nearly\ntwo months by the CoRoT satellite. Independent analyses of the light curve\nprovides evidence of monoperiodic variations with a frequency of 0.7572 c/d and\na peak-to-peak amplitude of ~2800 ppm. Multisite, ground-based spectroscopic\nobservations overlapping the CoRoT observations show the star to be a\nlong-period, single-lined binary. Furthermore, with the notable exception of\nmercury, they reveal the same periodicity as in photometry in the line moments\nof chemical species exhibiting strong overabundances (e.g., Mn and Y). In\ncontrast, lines of other elements do not show significant variations. As found\nin other HgMn stars, the pattern of variability consists in an absorption bump\nmoving redwards across the line profiles.

Large\nvariations in fluorine abundance in red giant stars of the globular cluster M22\nhave been recently reported by two different groups. Futhermore, one of these\nstudies claims that the abundance of fluorine is anti-correlated with sodium\nabundances in this cluster, leading to strong conclusions on the chemical\nhistory of M22. To validate this important finding, we re-examine the F\nabundance determinations of some of the previously studied stars. We have thus\nreanalysed some high-resolution VLT/CRIRES spectra of RGB stars found in M22 in\norder to re-estimate their fluorine abundance from the spectral synthesis of\nthe HF line at 2.336microns. Unlike what has been previously estimated, we show\nthat only upper limits or doubtful fluorine abundances with large uncertainties\nin M22 RGB stars can be derived. This is probably caused by an incorrect\nidentification of continuum fluctuations as the HF signature combined with a\nwrong correction of the stellar radial velocity. Such continuum fluctuations\ncould be the consequences of telluric residuals that are still present in the\nanalysed spectra.

This paper proposes\na Cellular Automata based framework for video Cloud Mining to extract the\ninformation from video data. This includes developing the technique for shot\ndetection then key frame analysis is considered to compare the frames of each\nshot to each others to define the relationship between shots. Cellular automata\nbased hierarchical clustering technique is adopted to make a group of similar\nshots to detect the particular event on some requirement as per user demand.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Nov 2013 15:12:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-19"}

The fluctuation\nconductivity is found to vanish nearly exponentially with temperature, allowing\nus to determine precisely the field H'c(T) and the temperature T'c above which\nthe SCFs are fully suppressed. T'c is always found much smaller than the\npseudogap temperature. A careful investigation near optimal doping shows that\nT'c is higher than the pseudogap T*, which indicates that the pseudogap cannot\nbe assigned to preformed pairs. For nearly optimally doped samples, the\nfluctuation conductivity can be accounted for by gaussian fluctuations\nfollowing the Ginzburg-Landau scheme. A phase fluctuation contribution might be\ninvoked for the most underdoped samples in a T range which increases when\ncontrolled disorder is introduced by electron irradiation. Quantitative\nanalysis of the fluctuating magnetoconductance allows us to determine the\ncritical field Hc2(0) which is found to be quite similar to H'c(0) and to\nincrease with hole doping. Studies of the incidence of disorder on both T'c and\nT* enable us to propose a three dimensional phase diagram including a disorder\naxis, which allows to explain most observations done in other cuprate families.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Nov 2013 10:22:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-21"}
