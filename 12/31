Symbolic and family-based\nmodel checking have been proven to be successful for tackling the combinatorial\nblow-up arising when reasoning about several feature combinations. However,\nmost formal verification approaches for SPLs presented in the literature focus\non the static SPLs, where the features of a product are fixed and cannot be\nchanged during runtime.

This\nenhancement can thus be sufficient to overcome the corresponding velocity\nsuppression, implying --- contrary to common lore --- that direct-detection\nexperiments can indeed be sensitive to pseudoscalar couplings. In this work, we\nexplain how this enhancement arises, and present a model-independent analysis\nof pseudoscalar interactions at direct-detection experiments.

By exploiting the second order statistical information\nof the received signals, co-prime arrays exhibit O(MN) degrees of freedom with\nonly M + N sensors. A sparsity based recovery method is proposed to fully\nutilize these degrees of freedom. Unlike traditional sparse recovery methods,\nthe proposed method is based on the developing theory of super resolution,\nwhich considers a continuous range of possible sources instead of discretizing\nthis range into a discrete grid. With this approach, off-grid effects inherited\nin traditional sparse recovery can be neglected, thus improving the accuracy of\nDOA estimation. In this paper we show that in the noiseless case one can\ntheoretically detect up to M N sources with only 2M + N sensors. The noise 2\nstatistics of co-prime arrays are also analyzed to demonstrate the robustness\nof the proposed optimization scheme. A source number detection method is\npresented based on the spectrum reconstructed from the sparse method.

To\nunderstand this discrepancy, the resistivity of paramagnetic Fe and Gd is\nevaluated by taking into account both spin and phonon disorder. Calculations\nare performed using the supercell approach within the linear muffin-tin orbital\nmethod. Phonon disorder is modeled by introducing random displacements of the\natomic nuclei, and the results are compared with the case of fictitious\nAnderson disorder. In both cases the resistivity shows a nonlinear dependence\non the square of the disorder potential, which is interpreted as a resistivity\nsaturation effect. This effect is much stronger in Gd than in Fe. The\nnon-linearity makes the phonon and spin-disorder contributions to the\nresistivity non-additive, and the standard procedure of extracting the\nspin-disorder resistivity by extrapolation from high temperatures becomes\nambiguous. An \"apparent\" spin-disorder resistivity obtained through such\nextrapolation is in much better agreement with experiment compared to the\nresults obtained by considering only spin disorder. By analyzing the spectral\nfunction of the paramagnetic Gd in the presence of Anderson disorder, the\nresistivity saturation is explained by the collapse of a large area of the\nFermi surface due to the disorder-induced mixing between the electronic and\nhole sheets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Dec 2013 18:12:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-08"}

More specifically, the\nFWs are localized fields \"at rest\", that is, with a static envelope (within\nwhich only the carrier wave propagates), and can be endowed moreover with a\nhigh transverse localization. In this paper we investigate by simulated\nexperiments, various cases of generation of ultrasonic FW fields, with\nfrequency f_o = 1 MHz in a water-like medium, taking account of the effects of\nattenuation. We present results of FWs for distances up to L=80 mm, in\nattenuating media with absorption coefficients alpha in the range 70 < alpha <\n170 dB/m. Such simulated FW fields are constructed by using a procedure\ndeveloped by us, via appropriate finite superpositions of monochromatic\nultrasonic Bessel beams. We pay due attention to the selection of the FW\nparameters, constrained by the tight restrictions imposed by experimental\nAcoustics, and to some practical implications of the transducer design.

Harnessing the benefits of quantum mechanics on a macroscopic level\nwould revolutionize fields ranging from telecommunication to biology, the\nlatter focused on here for reasons discussed. Contrary to misconceptions, there\nare no known physical laws that prevent the development of MQS. Instead, they\nare generally believed universally lost in complex systems from environmental\nentanglements (decoherence). But we argue success is achievable MQS with\ndecoherence compensation developed, naturally or artificially, from top-down\nrather current reductionist approaches. This paper advances the MQS field by a\ncomplex systems approach to decoherence. First, why complex system decoherence\napproaches (top-down) are needed is discussed. Specifically, complex adaptive\nsystems (CAS) are not amenable to reductionist models (and their master\nequations) because of emergent behavior, approximation failures, not accounting\nfor quantum compensator mechanisms, ignoring path integrals, and the subentity\nproblem. In addition, since MQS must exist within the context of the classical\nworld, rapid decoherence and prolonged coherence are both needed. Nature has\nalready demonstrated this for quantum subsystems such as photosynthesis and\nmagnetoreception. Second, we perform a preliminary study that illustrates a\ntop-down approach to potential MQS. In summary, reductionist arguments against\nMQS are not justifiable. It is more likely they are not easily detectable in\nlarge intact classical systems or has been destroyed by reductionist\nexperimental set-ups. This complex systems decoherence approach, using top down\ninvestigations, is critical to paradigm shifts in MQS research both in\nbiological and non-biological systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Dec 2013 19:40:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-31"}

For the\nestimation of an $n$-dimensional mean vector $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$ in the\nGaussian sequence model, is it possible to find an adaptive optimal threshold\nestimator in a full range of sparsity levels where nonadaptive optimality can\nbe achieved by threshold estimators? We provide an explicit affirmative answer\nas follows. Under the squared loss, adaptive minimaxity in strong and weak\n$\\ell_p$ balls with $0\\le p<2$ is achieved by a class of smooth threshold\nestimators with the threshold level of the Benjamini-Hochberg FDR rule or its a\ncertain approximation, provided that the minimax risk is between\n$n^{-\\delta_n}$ and $\\delta_n n$ for some $\\delta_n\\to 0$. For $p=0$, this\nmeans adaptive minimaxity in $\\ell_0$ balls when $1\\le\n\\|\\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\|_0\\ll n$. The class of smooth threshold estimators\nincludes the soft and firm threshold estimators but not the hard threshold\nestimator. The adaptive minimaxity in such a wide range is a delicate problem\nsince the same is not true for the FDR hard threshold estimator at certain\nthreshold and nominal FDR levels. The above adaptive minimaxity of the FDR\nsmooth-threshold estimator is established by proving a stronger notion of\nadaptive ratio optimality for the soft threshold estimator in the sense that\nthe risk for the FDR threshold level is uniformly within an infinitesimal\nfraction of the risk for the optimal threshold level for each unknown vector,\nwhen the minimum risk of nonadaptive soft threshold estimator is between\n$n^{-\\delta_n}$ and $\\delta_n n$. It is an interesting consequence of this\nadaptive ratio optimality that the FDR smooth-threshold estimator outperforms\nthe sample mean in the common mean model $\\theta_i=\\mu$ when $|\\mu|<n^{-1/2}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Dec 2013 20:00:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-31"}

At the same time, sizable flavor violation in sfermion masses is\nstill allowed by low-energy precision experiments when the mass scale is as\nhigh as O(100) TeV, which naturally explains the 125 GeV Higgs mass. In the\npresence of the sfermon flavor violation, however, the rates and branching\nfractions of proton decay can be drastically changed.

A\nrectangular gate section placed in a flume was given freedom to vibrate in the\nvertical direction. Holes in the gate bottom enabled leakage flow through the\ngate to enter the area directly under the gate which is known to play a key\nrole in most excitation mechanisms. For submerged discharge conditions with\nsmall gate openings the vertical dynamic support force was measured in the\nreduced velocity range 1.5 < Vr < 10.5 for a gate with and without holes. The\nleakage flow through the holes significantly reduced vibrations. This\nattenuation was most profound in the high stiffness region at 2 < Vr < 3.5.\nTwo-dimensional numerical simulations were performed with the Finite Element\nMethod to assess local velocities and pressures for both gate types. A moving\nmesh covering both solid and fluid domain allowed free gate movement and\ntwo-way fluid-structure interactions. Modelling assumptions and observed\nnumerical effects are discussed and quantified. The simulated added mass in\nstill water is shown to be close to experimental values. The spring stiffness\nand mass factor were varied to achieve similar response frequencies at the same\ndry natural frequencies as in the experiment. Although it was not possible to\nreproduce the vibrations dominated by impinging leading edge vortices (ILEV) at\nrelatively low Vr, the simulations at high Vr showed strong vibrations with\nmovement-induced excitation (MIE). For the latter case, the simulated response\nreduction of the ventilated gate agrees with the experimental results. The\nnumerical modelling results suggest that the leakage flow diminishes the\nwhipping effect of fluctuations at the trailing edge associated with the\nstreamwise pressure drop across the gate and the body's vertical oscillatory\nmotion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Dec 2013 20:52:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

We calculated the calibration\nrelations for the two datasets and the three met scales and found that they are\napproximately equivalent, with differences almost negligible. We compared our\nnIR calibrations with the corresponding optical ones, and found them to be\nequivalent, establishing that the luminosity-corrected rEW using the Ks\nmagnitude is compatible with the one obtained from the V magnitude.

In this work we present the basic idea of using such ST-switches for\nlow-power on-chip clocking. For clockingnetworks, Spin-Hall-Effect (SHE) can be\nused to produce an assist-field for fast ST-switching using global-mesh-clock\nwith less than 100mV swing. The ST-switch acts as a compact-latch, written by\nultra-low-voltage input-pulses. The data is read using a high-resistance\ntunnel-junction. The clock-driven SHE write-assist can be shared among large\nnumber of ST-latches, thereby reducing the load-capacitance for\nclock-distribution. The SHE assist can be activated by a low-swing clock\n(~150mV) and hence can facilitate ultra-low voltage clock-distribution. Owing\nto reduced clock-load and low-voltage operation, the proposed scheme can\nachieve 97% low-power for on-chip clocking as compared to the state of the art\nCMOS design. Rigorous device-circuit simulations and system-level modelling for\nthe proposed scheme will be addressed in future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Dec 2013 21:01:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-03"}

The\nflavor changing neutral Higgs (FCNH) effects in the minimal version of this\nmodel (LRSM), however, push the second Higgs mass to more than 15 TeV making it\ninaccessible at the LHC. Furthermore since the second Higgs mass is directly\nlinked to the $W_R$ mass, discovery of a \"low\" mass $W_R$ ($M_{W_R}\\leq 5-6$\nTeV) at the LHC would require values for some Higgs self couplings larger than\none. In this paper we present an extension of LRSM by adding a vector-like\n$SU(2)_R$ quark doublet which weakens the FCNH constraints allowing the second\nHiggs mass to be near or below TeV and a third neutral Higgs below 3 TeV for a\n$W_R$ mass below 5 TeV. It is then possible to search for these heavier Higgs\nbosons at the LHC, without conflicting with FCNH constraints.

Further, the method applies to general (non-attractive)\nmodels, though with no polynomial time guarantee in this case, leading to the\nimportant result that approximating $\\log$ of the Bethe partition function,\n$\\log Z_B=-\\min F$, for a general model to additive $\\epsilon$-accuracy may be\nreduced to a discrete MAP inference problem. We explore an application to\npredicting equipment failure on an urban power network and demonstrate that the\nBethe approximation can perform well even when BP fails to converge.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Dec 2013 22:40:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-03"}

The differences between\nstrengthless material models and including the full elasto-plastic model for\nsolid bodies with brittle failure and fragmentation when treating collisions of\nasteroid-sized bodies as they occur frequently in early planetary systems are\ndemonstrated. Methods. We study impacts of bodies of Ceres-mass with a solid\nrock impactor and a target with 30 weight-% water content as surface ice.} The\ninitial impact velocities and impact parameters are varied between the escape\nvelocity $v_\\mathrm{esc}$ to about 6 $v_\\mathrm{esc}$ and from head-on\ncollisions to close fly-bys, respectively. We simulate the collisions using our\nown SPH code utilizing both strengthless material and the full elasto-plastic\nmaterial model including brittle failure. Results. One of the most prominent\ndifferences is the higher degree of fragmentation and shattered debris clouds\nin the solid model. In most collision scenarios however, the final outcomes are\nvery similar and differ primarily by the about one order of magnitude higher\ndegree of fragmentation in the solid case. Also, the survivors tend to be of\nless mass in the solid case which also predicts a higher water loss than the\nstrengthless hydro model. This may be an effect of the relatively low-energy\nimpacts that cannot destroy the solid material instantly.

The basis of our analysis is the\nlinearity of the probability measure related to the Born probability\ninterpretation, which excludes non-contextual hidden-variables models in $d\\geq\n3$. To be specific, we note the inconsistency of the non-contextual\nhidden-variables model in $d=4$ with the linearity of the quantum mechanical\nprobability measure in the sense $\\langle\\psi|{\\bf a}\\cdot {\\bf\n\\sigma}\\otimes{\\bf b}\\cdot {\\bf \\sigma}|\\psi\\rangle+\\langle\\psi|{\\bf a}\\cdot\n{\\bf \\sigma}\\otimes{\\bf b}^{\\prime}\\cdot {\\bf\n\\sigma}|\\psi\\rangle=\\langle\\psi|{\\bf a}\\cdot {\\bf \\sigma}\\otimes ({\\bf b}+{\\bf\nb}^{\\prime})\\cdot {\\bf \\sigma}|\\psi\\rangle$ for non-collinear ${\\bf b}$ and\n${\\bf b}^{\\prime}$. It is then shown that Hardy's model in $d=4$ does not lead\nto a unique mathematical expression in the demonstration of the discrepancy of\nlocal realism (hidden-variables model) with entanglement and thus his proof is\nincomplete. We identify the origin of this non-uniqueness with the\nnon-uniqueness of translating quantum mechanical expressions into expressions\nin hidden-variables models, which results from the failure of the above\nlinearity of the probability measure. In contrast, if the linearity of the\nprobability measure is strictly imposed, which is tantamount to asking that the\nnon-contextual hidden-variables model in $d=4$ gives the CHSH inequality\n$|\\langle B\\rangle|\\leq 2$ uniquely, it is shown that the hidden-variables\nmodel can describe only separable quantum mechanical states; this conclusion is\nin perfect agreement with the so-called Gisin's theorem which states that\n$|\\langle B\\rangle|\\leq 2$ implies separable states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Dec 2013 01:08:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-17"}

The astrophysical site to\nproduce fluorine is suggested to be asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. In\nthese stars the 15N(n, g)16N reaction could affect the abundance of fluorine by\ncompeting with 15N(a, g)19F. The 15N(n, g)16N reaction rate depends directly on\nthe neutron spectroscopic factors of the low-lying states in 16N. The angular\ndistributions of the 15N(7Li, 6Li)16N reaction populating the ground state and\nthe first three excited states in 16N are measured using a Q3D magnetic\nspectrograph and are used to derive the spectroscopic factors of these states\nbased on distorted wave Born approximation (DWBA) analysis. The spectroscopic\nfactors of these four states are extracted to be 0.96+-0.09, 0.69+-0.09,\n0.84+-0.08 and 0.65+-0.08, respectively. Based on the new spectroscopic factors\nwe derive the 15N(n,g)16N reaction rate. The accuracy and precision of the\nspectroscopic factors are enhanced due to the first application of\nhigh-precision magnetic spectrograph for resolving the closely-spaced 16N\nlevels which can not be achieved in most recent measurement. The present result\ndemonstrates that two levels corresponding to neutron transfers to the 2s1/2\norbit in 16N are not so good single-particle levels although 15N is a closed\nneutron-shell nucleus. This finding is contrary to the shell model expectation.\nThe present work also provides an independent examination to shed some light on\nthe existing discrepancies in the spectroscopic factors and the 15N(n, g)16N\nrate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Dec 2013 01:41:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-03"}

The classic Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR)\nmodel of epidemics is one such example where the scaling behavior near a\ncritical point has been studied extensively. In this system the distribution of\noutbreak sizes scales as $P(n) \\sim n^{-3/2}$ at the critical point as the\nsystem size $N$ becomes infinite. The finite-size scaling laws for the outbreak\nsize and duration are also well understood and characterized. In this work, we\nreport scaling laws for a model with SIR structure coupled with a constant\nforce of infection per susceptible, akin to a `reservoir forcing'. We find that\nthe statistics of outbreaks in this system are fundamentally different than\nthose in a simple SIR model. Instead of fixed exponents, all scaling laws\nexhibit tunable exponents parameterized by the dimensionless rate of external\nforcing. As the external driving rate approaches a critical value, the scale of\nthe average outbreak size converges to that of the maximal size, and above the\ncritical point, the scaling laws bifurcate into two regimes. Whereas a simple\nSIR process can only exhibit outbreaks of size $\\mathcal{O}(N^{1/3})$ and\n$\\mathcal{O}(N)$ depending on whether the system is at or above the epidemic\nthreshold, a driven SIR process can exhibit a richer spectrum of outbreak sizes\nthat scale as $O(N^{\\xi})$ where $\\xi \\in (0,1] \\backslash \\{2/3\\}$ and\n$\\mathcal{O}((N/\\log N)^{2/3})$ at the multi-critical point.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Dec 2013 02:06:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

The unknowns are (u;p;v), being the fluid velocity, fluid\npressure and solid velocity. This combined field formulation uses Arbitrary\nLagrangian Eulerian (ALE) description for the fluid and Lagrangian description\nfor the solid. It automatically enforces the simultaneous continuities of both\nvelocity and traction along the FS interface. We present a first order in time\nfully discrete scheme when the flow is incompressible Navier-Stokes and when\nthe solid is elastic. The interface position is determined by first order\nextrapolation so that the generation of the fluid mesh and the computation of\n(u;p;v) are decoupled. This explicit interface advancing enables us to save\nhalf of the unknowns comparing with traditional monolithic schemes. When the\nsolid has convex strain energy (e.g. linear elastic), we prove that the total\nenergy of the fluid and the solid at time t^{n} is bounded by the total energy\nat time t^{n-1}. Like in the continuous case, the fluid mesh velocity which is\nused in ALE description does not enter into the stability bound. Surprisingly,\nthe nonlinear convection term in the Navier-Stokes equations plays a crucial\nrole to stabilize the scheme and the stability result does not apply to Stokes\nflow. As the nonlinear convection term is treated semi-implicitly, in each time\nstep, we only need to solve a linear system (and only once) which involves\nmerely (u;p;v) if the solid is linear elastic. Two numerical tests including\nthe benchmark test of Navier-Stokes flow past a Saint Venant-Kirchhoff elastic\nbar are performed. In addition to the stability, we also confirm the first\norder temporal accuracy of our explicit interface advancing scheme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Dec 2013 03:48:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-03"}

Its typical scale of about 1 - 2 Mm\nis set by the balance between convection, free-streaming radiation, and the\nstrong density stratification in the surface layers.\n  The physics of granulation is well understood, as demonstrated by the close\nagreement between numerical simulation, theory, and observation. Superimposed\non the energetic granular structure comprising high-speed flows, are larger\nscale long-lived flow systems (~ 300 m/s) called supergranules.\nSupergranulation has a typical scale of 24 - 36 Mm. It is not clear if\nsupergranulation results from the interaction of granules or is causally linked\nto deep convection or a consequence of magneto-convection. Other outstanding\nquestions remain: how deep are supergranules? How do they participate in global\ndynamics of the Sun? Further challenges are posed by our lack of insight into\nthe dynamics of larger scales in the deep convection region. Recent\nhelioseismic constraints have suggested that convective velocity amplitudes on\nlarge scales may be overestimated by an order of magnitude or more, implying\nthat Reynolds stresses associated with large-scale convection, thought to play\na significant role in the sustenance of differential rotation and meridional\ncirculation, might be two orders of magnitude weaker than theory and\ncomputation predict.

This success is due to the fact that MKL\nhas the ability to choose from a variety of feature kernels to identify the\noptimal kernel combination. But the initial formulation of MKL was only able to\nselect the best of the features and misses out many other informative kernels\npresented. To overcome this, the Lp norm based formulation was proposed by\nKloft et. al. This formulation is capable of choosing a non-sparse set of\nkernels through a control parameter p. Unfortunately, the parameter p does not\nhave a direct meaning to the number of kernels selected. We have observed that\nstricter control over the number of kernels selected gives us an edge over\nthese techniques in terms of accuracy of classification and also helps us to\nfine tune the algorithms to the time requirements at hand. In this work, we\npropose a Controlled Sparsity Kernel Learning (CSKL) formulation that can\nstrictly control the number of kernels which we wish to select. The CSKL\nformulation introduces a parameter t which directly corresponds to the number\nof kernels selected. It is important to note that a search in t space is finite\nand fast as compared to p. We have also provided an efficient Reduced Gradient\nDescent based algorithm to solve the CSKL formulation, which is proven to\nconverge. Through our experiments on the Caltech101 Object Categorization\ndataset, we have also shown that one can achieve better accuracies than the\nprevious formulations through the right choice of t.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Dec 2013 09:13:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-03"}

Many organizations now face challenges in\ndetermining the maturity of the Quality Management group along with the service\noffered by them and the right way to elevate the maturity of the same. The\nobjective of this whitepaper is to propose a new model, the Audit Maturity\nModel which will provide organizations with a measure of their maturity in\nquality management in the perspective of auditing, along with recommendations\nfor preventing delivery outage, and identifying risk to achieve business\nexcellence. This will enable organizations to assess Quality Management\nmaturity higher than basic hygiene and will also help them to identify gaps and\nto take corrective actions for achieving higher maturity levels.

Adding 2MASS colors to WISE photometry improves\nstar-galaxy separation efficiency substantially at the expense of loosing a\nsmall fraction of the galaxies. We find that 93% of the WISE objects within\nW1<15.2 mag have a 2MASS match, and that a class of supervised machine learning\nalgorithms, Support Vector Machines (SVM), are efficient classifiers of objects\nin our multicolor data set. We constructed a training set from the SDSS\nPhotoObj table with known star-galaxy separation, and determined redshift\ndistribution of our sample from the GAMA spectroscopic survey. Varying the\ncombination of photometric parameters input into our algorithm we show that W1\n- J is a simple and effective star-galaxy separator, capable of producing\nresults comparable to the multi-dimensional SVM classification. We present a\ndetailed description of our star-galaxy separation methods, and characterize\nthe robustness of our tools in terms of contamination, completeness, and\naccuracy.

We present a numerical study of a\nminimal model that supports bistability and catastrophic shift on spatial\ndomain with demographic noise and an absorbing state. When the external\nparameter varies adiabatically the transition is continuous and the front\nvelocity renormalizes to zero at the extinction transition. Below the\ntransition one may identify three modes of desertification: accumulation of\nlocal catastrophes, desert invasion and global collapse. A catastrophic regime\nshift occurs as a dynamical hysteresis, when the pace of environmental\nvariations is too fast.

This picture is especially relevant for low-mass\n(below about solar mass) neutron stars, where non-nucleonic components are not\nexpected to occur. Due to the saturation property of nucleonic matter, leading\nto the celebrated liquid-drop picture of atomic nuclei, empirical nuclear\nmasses and radii can be approximately expressed as function of atomic mass\nnumber. It is, however, not straightforward to express masses and radii of\nneutron stars even in the low-mass range where the structure is determined by a\nbalance between the pressure of neutron-rich nucleonic matter and the gravity.\nSuch expressions would be of great use given possible simultaneous mass and\nradius measurements. Here we successfully construct theoretical formulas for\nthe masses and radii of low-mass neutron stars from various models that are\nconsistent with empirical masses and radii of stable nuclei. In this process,\nwe discover a new equation-of-state parameter that characterizes the structure\nof low-mass neutron stars.
