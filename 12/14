We\ndemonstrate that for layered materials like Bi$_2$Se$_3$ the surface states on\nthe top surface behave qualitatively different than the surface states at the\nside surfaces. We show that the group velocity of the surface states can be\ntuned by the direction and strength of the exchange field. If the exchange\nfield becomes larger than the bulk gap of the material, a phase transition into\na topologically nontrivial semimetallic state occurs. In particular, the\nmaterial becomes a Weyl semimetal, if the exchange field possesses a non-zero\ncomponent perpendicular to the layers. Associated with the Weyl semimetallic\nstate we show that Fermi arcs appear at the surface. Under certain\ncircumstances either one-dimensional or even two-dimensional surface flat bands\ncan appear. We show that the appearence of these flat bands is related to\nchiral symmetries of the system and can be understood in terms of topological\nwinding numbers. In contrast to previous systems that have been suggested to\npossess surface flat bands, the present system has a much larger energy scale,\nallowing the observation of surface flat bands at room temperature. The flat\nbands are tunable in the sense that they can be turned on or off by rotation of\nthe ferromagnetic exchange field.

The data also allowed to study\nthree of the Class I intermediate-mass objects within the cloud. We derived\napproximate cloud temperatures to study the effect and potential interactions\nbetween the protostars and the cloud. The Class 0 object is associated with the\ndensest and colder part of IC1396A. Heating in the cloud is dominated by the\nwinds and radiation of the O6.5 star HD 206267 and, to a lesser extent, by the\neffects of the Herbig Ae star V 390 Cep. The surroundings of the Class I and\nClass II objects embedded in the cloud also appear warmer than the sourceless\nareas, although most of the low-mass objects cannot be individually extracted\ndue to distance and beam dilution. The observations suggest that at least two\nepisodes of star formation have occurred in IC1396A. One would have originated\nthe known, ~1 Myr-old Class I and II objects in the cloud, and a new wave of\nstar formation would have produced the Class 0 source at the tip of the\nbrigth-rimmed cloud.

Each buyer\n$i$ is interested in getting exactly $d_i$ items, and each item $j$ gives a\nbenefit $v_{ij}$ to buyer $i$. We distinguish between unrelated and related\nvaluations. In the former case, the benefit $v_{ij}$ is completely arbitrary,\nwhile, in the latter, each item $j$ has a quality $q_j$, each buyer $i$ has a\nvalue $v_i$ and the benefit $v_{ij}$ is defined as the product $v_i q_j$. The\nproblem asks to determine a price for each item and an allocation of bundles of\nitems to buyers with the aim of maximizing the total revenue, that is, the sum\nof the prices of all the sold items. The allocation must be envy-free, that is,\neach buyer must be happy with her assigned bundle and cannot improve her\nutility. We first prove that, for related valuations, the problem cannot be\napproximated to a factor $O(m^{1-\\epsilon})$, for any $\\epsilon>0$, unless {\\sf\nP} = {\\sf NP} and that such result is asymptotically tight. In fact we provide\na simple $m$-approximation algorithm even for unrelated valuations.

For such instances,\nwe design an interesting $2$-approximation algorithm and show that no\n$(2-\\epsilon)$-approximation is possible for any $0<\\epsilon\\leq 1$, unless\n{\\sf P} $=$ {\\sf NP}. We observe that it is possible to efficiently check if an\ninstance is proper, and if discarding useless buyers is allowed, an instance\ncan be made proper in polynomial time, without worsening the value of its\noptimal solution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Dec 2013 18:03:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-16"}

Among the several AI approaches, player\nmodeling is becoming an important one. The main idea is to understand and model\nthe player characteristics and behaviors in order to develop a better AI. In\nthis work, we discuss several aspects of this new field. We proposed a taxonomy\nto organize the area, discussing several facets of this topic, ranging from\nimplementation decisions up to what a model attempts to describe. We then\nclassify, in our taxonomy, some of the most important works in this field. We\nalso presented a generic approach to deal with player modeling using ML, and we\ninstantiated this approach to model players' preferences in the game\nCivilization IV. The instantiation of this approach has several steps. We first\ndiscuss a generic representation, regardless of what is being modeled, and\nevaluate it performing experiments with the strategy game Civilization IV.\nContinuing the instantiation of the proposed approach we evaluated the\napplicability of using game score information to distinguish different\npreferences. We presented a characterization of virtual agents in the game,\ncomparing their behavior with their stated preferences. Once we have\ncharacterized these agents, we were able to observe that different preferences\ngenerate different behaviors, measured by several game indicators. We then\ntackled the preference modeling problem as a binary classification task, with a\nsupervised learning approach. We compared four different methods, based on\ndifferent paradigms (SVM, AdaBoost, NaiveBayes and JRip), evaluating them on a\nset of matches played by different virtual agents. We conclude our work using\nthe learned models to infer human players' preferences. Using some of the\nevaluated classifiers we obtained accuracies over 60% for most of the inferred\npreferences.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Dec 2013 18:32:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-16"}

For this reason it has been selected as a cluster\ntarget of the Gaia-ESO Survey, and spectra of many stars in the main sequence\nand red clump phases are now available. Moreover, although it has been studied\nby several authors in the past, no consensus on the evolutionary status of Tr\n20 has been reached. The heavy contamination of field stars (the line of sight\nof Tr 20 crosses the Carina spiral arm) complicates a correct interpretation.\nAnother interesting aspect of the cluster is that it shows a broadened\nmain-sequence turn-off and a prominent and extended red-clump, characteristics\nthat are not easily explained by classical evolutionary models.

The red damping wing by intervening HI gas outside the host can\nreduce the residual by about 3 sigma statistical significance.

The data are well fit by this\nexomoon model, but an alternate star+planet model fits the data almost as well.\nNevertheless, these results indicate the potential of microlensing to detect\nexomoons, albeit ones that are different from the giant planet moons in our\nsolar system. The argument for an exomoon hinges on the system being relatively\nclose to the Sun. The data constrain the product M pi_rel, where M is the lens\nsystem mass and pi_rel is the lens-source relative parallax. If the lens system\nis nearby (large pi_rel), then M is small (a few Jupiter masses) and the\ncompanion is a sub-Earth-mass exomoon.

However, these models have generally failed to produce\nMars-sized objects around 1.5 AU. The body that is usually formed around Mars'\nsemimajor axis is, in general, much more massive than Mars. Only when Jupiter\nand Saturn are assumed to have initially very eccentric orbits (e $\\sim$ 0.1),\nwhich seems fairly unlikely for the solar system, or alternately, if the\nprotoplanetary disk is truncated at 1.0 AU, simulations have been able to\nproduce Mars-like bodies in the correct location.

We have carried out extensive numerical simulations of the formation of\nterrestrial planets in such a disk for different scales of the local density\ndepletion, and for different orbital configurations of the giant planets.

The idea is to install bike stations at various points\nin the city, from which a registered user can easily loan a bike by removing it\nfrom a specialized rack. After the ride, the user may return the bike at any\nstation (if there is a free rack). Services of this kind are mainly public or\nsemi-public, often aimed at increasing the attractiveness of non-motorized\nmeans of transportation, and are usually free, or almost free, of charge for\nthe users. Depending on their location, bike stations have specific patterns\nregarding when they are empty or full. For instance, in cities where most jobs\nare located near the city centre, the commuters cause certain peaks in the\nmorning: the central bike stations are filled, while the stations in the\noutskirts are emptied. Furthermore, stations located on top of a hill are more\nlikely to be empty, since users are less keen on cycling uphill to return the\nbike, and often leave their bike at a more reachable station. These issues\nresult in substantial user dissatisfaction which may eventually cause the users\nto abandon the service. This is why nowadays most bike sharing system providers\ntake measures to rebalance them.

However, efforts to constrain the molecular abundances to\nwithin several orders of magnitude are thwarted by the broad range of\ndegenerate solutions that fit the data. Here we explore, with radiative\ntransfer models and analytical approximations, the nature of the degenerate\nsolution sets resulting from the sparse measurements of \"hot Jupiter\"\nexoplanets. As demonstrated with simple analytical expressions, primary transit\nmeasurements probe roughly 4 atmospheric scale heights at each wavelength band.\nDerived mixing ratios from these data are highly sensitive to errors in the\nradius in planet (at a reference pressure), which are approximately a few\npercent. For example, an uncertainty of 1% in the radius of a 1000 K and\nH2-based exoplanet with Jupiter's radius and mass, causes an uncertainty of a\nfactor of ~100-10000 in the derived gas mixing ratios. The degree of\nsensitivity depends on how the line strength increases with the optical depth\n(i.e. the curve of growth) and the atmospheric scale height. Temperature\ndegeneracies in the solutions of the primary transit data, which manifest their\neffects through scale height and absorption coefficients, are smaller. We argue\nthat these challenges can be partially surmounted by a combination of selected\nwavelength sampling of optical and IR measurements and, when possible, the\njoint analysis of transit and secondary eclipse data of exoplanets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Dec 2013 00:23:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

Examples of such\nsituations include point-to-point communication over inter-symbol interference\n(ISI) channels and asynchronous wireless networks. In these scenarios, although\nthe receiver may know all the delays, it is often not be an easy task for the\nreceiver to compensate the delays as the signals are mixed together. A novel\nframework called interleave/deinterleave transform (IDT) is proposed to deal\nwith this problem. It is shown that the IDT allows one to design the delays so\nthat quasi-cyclic (QC) codes with a proper shifting constraint can be used\naccordingly. When used in conjunction with QC codes, IDT provides significantly\nbetter performance than existing schemes relying solely on cyclic codes. Two\ninstances of asynchronous physical-layer network coding, namely the\ninteger-forcing equalization for ISI channels and asynchronous\ncompute-and-forward, are then studied. For integer-forcing equalization, the\nproposed scheme provides improved performance over using cyclic codes. For\nasynchronous compute-and-forward, the proposed scheme shows that there is no\nloss in the achievable information due to delays which are integer multiples of\nthe symbol duration. Further, the proposed approach shows that delays\nintroduced by the channel can sometimes be exploited to obtain higher\ninformation rates than those obtainable in the synchronous case. The proposed\nIDT can be thought of as a generalization of the interleaving/deinterleaving\nidea proposed by Wang et al. which allows the use of QC codes thereby\nsubstantially increasing the design space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Dec 2013 04:46:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 14 Nov 2014 21:23:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-18"}

A\ncommon architecture for such systems is to use a trusted component such as a\ncryptographic co-processor for query processing that is used to securely\ndecrypt data and perform computations in plaintext. The trusted component has\nlimited memory, so most of the (input and intermediate) data is kept encrypted\nin an untrusted storage and moved to the trusted component on ``demand.''\n  In this setting, even with strong encryption, the data access pattern from\nuntrusted storage has the potential to reveal sensitive information; indeed,\nall existing systems that use a trusted component for query processing over\nencrypted data have this vulnerability. In this paper, we undertake the first\nformal study of secure query processing, where an adversary having full\nknowledge of the query (text) and observing the query execution learns nothing\nabout the underlying database other than the result size of the query on the\ndatabase. We introduce a simpler notion, oblivious query processing, and show\nformally that a query admits secure query processing iff it admits oblivious\nquery processing. We present oblivious query processing algorithms for a rich\nclass of database queries involving selections, joins, grouping and\naggregation. For queries not handled by our algorithms, we provide some initial\nevidence that designing oblivious (and therefore secure) algorithms would be\nhard via reductions from two simple, well-studied problems that are generally\nbelieved to be hard. Our study of oblivious query processing also reveals\ninteresting connections to database join theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Dec 2013 07:14:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-17"}

In the experiment, small carbon-based\nmaterial rods are inserted in the epoxy. The samples are held in one side and\nsubjected to compressive load on the other side. All the samples swell at load\nsides. Image analysis on the carbon-based rods figures out the internal\nresponse, which seems to be isotropy in lateral direction.

Recently we showed that\nthe magnetospheric plasma between the main rings and Enceladus exhibited a time\ndependence that we attributed to a seasonally variable source of oxygen from\nthe main rings (Elrod et al., 2012). Such a temporal variation was subsequently\nseen in the energetic ion composition (Christon et al., 2013). Here we include\nthe most recent measurements by the Cassini Plasma Spectrometer (CAPS) in our\nanalysis (Elrod et al., 2012) and modeling (Tseng et al., 2013a) of the\ntemporal and radial dependence of the thermal plasma in the region between the\nmain rings and the orbit of Enceladus. Data taken in 2012, well past equinox\nfor which the northern side of the main rings were illuminated, appear\nconsistent with a seasonal variation. Although the thermal plasma in this\nregion comes from two sources, the extended ring atmosphere and the Enceladus\ntorus that have very different radial and temporal trends, the heavy ion\ndensity is found to exhibit a steep radial dependence that is similar for all\nyears examined. Using our chemical model, we show that this dependence requires\na radial dependence for Enceladus torus than differs from recent models or,\nmore likely, enhanced heavy ion quenching with decreasing distance from the\nedge of the main rings. We examine the possible physical processes and suggest\nthat the precipitation of the inward diffusing high energy background radiation\nonto the edge of the main rings could play an important role.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Dec 2013 14:46:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

To highlight\ninterferences and resonances in the model, we consider the selectivity filter\nto be driven by a controlled time-dependent external field which changes the\nfree energy scenario and consequently the conduction of the ions.

The central data are used to evaluate the instrumental energy-scale\ncalibration with accuracy confirmed to within around 300 km/s, by the spatial\nand temporal variation of the instruments. These deep and well-calibrated data\nare used to measure X-ray redshifts of the intracluster medium. A hint of gas\nbulk motion, with radial velocity of about -(150-300) km/s, relative to the\nmain system was found at 2-4 arcmin (45-90kpc) west of the cluster center,\nwhere an X-ray excess and a cold front were found previously.

However, because it is hard to support code division multiple\naccess in narrowband signal, to track multiple targets, existing NBU-based\nlocating systems generally need to assign exclusive time slot to each target to\navoid the signal conflicts. Because the propagation speed of ultrasound is slow\nin air, dividing exclusive time slots on a single channel causes the location\nupdating rate for each target rather low, leading to unsatisfied tracking\nperformances as the number of targets increases. In this paper, we investigated\na new multiple target locating method using NBU, called UltraChorus, which is\nto locate multiple targets while allowing them sending NBU signals\nsimultaneously, i.e., in chorus mode. It can dramatically increase the location\nupdating rate. In particular, we investigated by both experiments and\ntheoretical analysis on the necessary and sufficient conditions for resolving\nthe conflicts of multiple NBU signals on a single channel, which is referred as\nthe conditions for chorus ranging and chorus locating. To tackle the difficulty\ncaused by the anonymity of the measured distances, we further developed\nconsistent position generation algorithm and probabilistic particle filter\nalgorithm}to label the distances by sources, to generate reasonable location\nestimations, and to disambiguate the motion trajectories of the multiple\nconcurrent targets based on the anonymous distance measurements. Extensive\nevaluations by both simulation and testbed were carried out, which verified the\neffectiveness of our proposed theories and algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Dec 2013 07:47:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-19"}
