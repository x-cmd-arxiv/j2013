A key feature of the approach is that it provides\na closed integral expression for the time-dependence of the density matrix of\nthe molecular junction after switch-on of a bias or gate potential which can be\nevaluated without the necessity of propagating individual single-particle\norbitals. This allows for the study of time-dependent transport in large\nmolecular systems coupled to wide band leads. As an application of the\nformalism we study the transient dynamics of zigzag and armchair graphene\nnanoribbons of different symmetries. We find that the transient times can\nexceed several hundreds of femtoseconds while displaying a long time\noscillatory motion related to multiple reflections of the density wave in the\nnanoribbons at the ribbon--lead interface. This temporal profile has a shape\nthat scales with the length of the ribbons and is modulated by fast\noscillations described by intra-ribbon and ribbon--lead transitions. Especially\nin the armchair nanoribbons there exists a sequence of quasi-stationary states\nrelated to reflections at the edge state located at the ribbon--lead interface.\nIn the case of zigzag nanoribbons there is a predominant oscillation frequency\nassociated with virtual transitions between the edge states and the Fermi\nlevels of the electrode. We further study the local bond currents in the\nnanoribbons and find that the parity of the edges strongly affects the path of\nthe electrons in the nanoribbons.

However, enforcement of the rules of these\nlanes is currently performed by roadside enforcement officers using visual\nobservation. Manual roadside enforcement is known to be inefficient, costly,\npotentially dangerous, and ultimately ineffective. Violation rates up to\n50%-80% have been reported, while manual enforcement rates of less than 10% are\ntypical. Therefore, there is a need for automated vehicle occupancy detection\nto support HOV/HOT lane enforcement. A key component of determining vehicle\noccupancy is to determine whether or not the vehicle's front passenger seat is\noccupied. In this paper, we examine two methods of determining vehicle front\nseat occupancy using a near infrared (NIR) camera system pointed at the\nvehicle's front windshield. The first method examines a state-of-the-art\ndeformable part model (DPM) based face detection system that is robust to\nfacial pose.

Methods: The proposed scheme is inspired by the recently developed\ncompressive sensing and interior tomography techniques, where the data\nacquisition system targets a region of interest (ROI) to acquire limited and\ntruncated data. The source and detector are translated in opposite directions\nfor either ROI reconstruction with one or more localized linear scans or global\nreconstruction by combining multiple ROI reconstructions. In other words, the\npopular slip ring is replaced by a translation based setup, and the\ninstrumentation cost is reduced by a relaxation of the imaging speed\nrequirement. Results: The various translational scanning modes are\ntheoretically analyzed, and the scanning parameters are optimized. The\nnumerical simulation results from different numbers of linear scans confirm the\nfeasibility of the proposed scheme, and suggest two preferred low-end systems\nfor horizontal and vertical patient positions respectively.

Our main goal is to\nput emphasis on the role of a saturation scale in the initial gluon spectrum,\nwhich makes the initial distribution far from a thermalized one. We find that\nthe presence of the saturation scale reduces the efficiency in building-up the\nelliptic flow, even if the thermalization process is quite fast $\\tau_{therm}\n\\approx 0.8 \\,\\rm fm/c$ and the pressure isotropization even faster\n$\\tau_{isotr} \\approx 0.3 \\,\\rm fm/c$. The impact of the non-equilibrium\nimplied by the saturation scale manifests for non-central collisions and can\nmodify the estimate of the viscosity respect to the assumption of full\nthermalization in $p_T$-space.

We employ a combination of soft\nthresholding, windowed thresholding, and resolution in community detection,\nthat enable us to identify and isolate structures associated with different\nweights. One such mesoscale structure is bipartivity, which quantifies the\nextent to which the brain is divided into two partitions with high connectivity\nbetween partitions and low connectivity within partitions.

One\nclassical theory of the early visual pathway hypothesizes that it serves to\ncapture the statistical structure of the visual inputs by efficiently coding\nthe visual information in its outputs. Until recently, most computational\nmodels following this theory have focused upon explaining the receptive field\nproperties of one or two visual layers. Recent work in deep networks has\neliminated this concern, however, there is till the retinal layer to consider.\nHere we improve on a previously-described hierarchical model Recursive ICA\n(RICA) [1] which starts with PCA, followed by a layer of sparse coding or ICA,\nfollowed by a component-wise nonlinearity derived from considerations of the\nvariable distributions expected by ICA. This process is then repeated. In this\nwork, we improve on this model by using a new version of sparse PCA (sPCA),\nwhich results in biologically-plausible receptive fields for both the sPCA and\nICA/sparse coding.

Nematic\norder breaks the discrete lattice rotational symmetry by making the $x$ and $y$\ndirections in the Fe plane non-equivalent. This can happen because of (i) a\ntetragonal to orthorhombic structural transition, (ii) a spontaneous breaking\nof an orbital symmetry, or (iii) a spontaneous development of an Ising-type\nspin-nematic order - a magnetic state that breaks rotational symmetry but\npreserves time-reversal symmetry. The Landau theory of phase transitions\ndictates that the development of one of these orders should immediately induce\nthe other two, making the origin of nematicity a physics realization of a\n\"chicken and egg problem\". The three scenarios are, however, quite different\nfrom a microscopic perspective. While in the structural scenario lattice\nvibrations (phonons) play the dominant role, in the other two scenarios\nelectronic correlations are responsible for the nematic order. In this review,\nwe argue that experimental and theoretical evidence strongly points to the\nelectronic rather than phononic mechanism, placing the nematic order in the\nclass of correlation-driven electronic instabilities, like superconductivity\nand density-wave transitions. We discuss different microscopic models for\nnematicity in the iron pnictides, and link nematicity to other ordered states\nof the global phase diagram of these materials -- magnetism and\nsuperconductivity. In the magnetic model nematic order pre-empts stripe-type\nmagnetic order, and the same interaction which favors nematicity also gives\nrise to an unconventional $s^{+-}$ superconductivity.

This is a contribution\nto the growing body of work contrasting the representational power of deep and\nshallow network architectures. In particular, we offer a framework for\ncomparing deep and shallow models that belong to the family of piecewise linear\nfunctions based on computational geometry. We look at a deep rectifier\nmulti-layer perceptron (MLP) with linear outputs units and compare it with a\nsingle layer version of the model. In the asymptotic regime, when the number of\ninputs stays constant, if the shallow model has $kn$ hidden units and $n_0$\ninputs, then the number of linear regions is $O(k^{n_0}n^{n_0})$. For a $k$\nlayer model with $n$ hidden units on each layer it is $\\Omega(\\left\\lfloor\n{n}/{n_0}\\right\\rfloor^{k-1}n^{n_0})$.

Once in resonance, the planets' eccentricities grow to an\nequilibrium value that depends on the ratio of migration time scale to the\neccentricity damping timescale, $K=\\tau_a/\\tau_e$, with higher values of\nequilibrium eccentricity for lower values of $K$. For low equilibrium\neccentricities, $e_{eq}\\propto K^{-1/2}$. The stability of a planet pair\ndepends on eccentricity so the system can become unstable before it reaches its\nequilibrium eccentricity. Using a resonant overlap criterion that takes into\naccount the role of first and second order resonances and depends on\neccentricity, we find a function $K_{min}(\\mu_p, j)$ that defines the lowest\nvalue for $K$, as a function of the ratio of total planet mass to stellar mass\n($\\mu_p$) and the period ratio of the resonance defined as $P_1/P_2=j/(j+k)$,\nthat allows two convergently migrating planets to remain stable in resonance at\ntheir equilibrium eccentricities. We scaled the functions $K_{min}$ for each\nresonance of the same order into a single function $K_c$. The function $K_{c}$\nfor planet pairs in first order resonances is linear with increasing planet\nmass and quadratic for pairs in second order resonances with a coefficient\ndepending on the relative migration rate and strongly on the planet to planet\nmass ratio. The linear relation continues until the mass approaches a critical\nmass defined by the 2/7 resonance overlap instability law and $K_c \\to \\infty$.\nWe compared our analytic boundary with an observed sample of resonant two\nplanet systems.

Raptor codes allow low-complexity decoding\nof very long codewords while providing capacity- approaching performance for\nerasure channels. For the off-line page recovery scheme, one whole NAND block\nforms a Raptor codeword with each inner codeword typically made up of several\nRaptor symbols. An efficient look-up-table strategy is devised for Raptor\nencoding and decoding which avoids using large buffers in the controller\ndespite the substantial size of the Raptor code employed.

Despite the linearity of their\ninput-output map, such networks have nonlinear gradient descent dynamics on\nweights that change with the addition of each new hidden layer. We show that\ndeep linear networks exhibit nonlinear learning phenomena similar to those seen\nin simulations of nonlinear networks, including long plateaus followed by rapid\ntransitions to lower error solutions, and faster convergence from greedy\nunsupervised pretraining initial conditions than from random initial\nconditions. We provide an analytical description of these phenomena by finding\nnew exact solutions to the nonlinear dynamics of deep learning.

We show that, under certain conditions on the training data,\nunsupervised pretraining can find this special class of initial conditions,\nwhile scaled random Gaussian initializations cannot. We further exhibit a new\nclass of random orthogonal initial conditions on weights that, like\nunsupervised pre-training, enjoys depth independent learning times.

By\nmeans of the Mueller matrix formalism, we compute the response matrices of each\nmirror arrangement for a range of zenith angles and wavelengths.

Hence, cloud monitoring tools can\nassist a cloud providers or application developers in: (i) keeping their\nresources and applications operating at peak efficiency; (ii) detecting\nvariations in resource and application performance; (iii) accounting the\nService Level Agreement (SLA) violations of certain QoS parameters; and (iv)\ntracking the leave and join operations of cloud resources due to failures and\nother dynamic configuration changes.\n  In this paper, we identify and discuss the major research dimensions and\ndesign issues related to engineering cloud monitoring tools. We further discuss\nhow aforementioned research dimensions and design issues are handled by current\nacademic research as well as by commercial monitoring tools.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Dec 2013 22:54:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-24"}

Such real-world events happen at specific\ngeographical locations and disrupt specific parts of the network. Therefore,\nthe geographical layout of the network determines the impact of such events on\nthe network's physical topology in terms of capacity, connectivity, and flow.\n  Recent works focused on assessing the vulnerability of a deterministic\nnetwork to such events. In this work, we focus on assessing the vulnerability\nof (geographical) random networks to such disasters. We consider stochastic\ngraph models in which nodes and links are probabilistically distributed on a\nplane, and model the disaster event as a circular cut that destroys any node or\nlink within or intersecting the circle.\n  We develop algorithms for assessing the damage of both targeted and\nnon-targeted (random) attacks and determining which attack locations have the\nexpected most disruptive impact on the network. Then, we provide experimental\nresults for assessing the impact of circular disasters to communications\nnetworks in the USA, where the network's geographical layout was modeled\nprobabilistically, relying on demographic information only. Our results\ndemonstrates the applicability of our algorithms to real-world scenarios.\n  Our algorithms allows to examine how valuable is public information about the\nnetwork's geographical area (e.g., demography, topography, economy) to an\nattacker's destruction assessment capabilities in the case the network's\nphysical topology is hidden or examine the affect of hiding the actual physical\nlocation of the fibers on the attack strategy. Thereby, our schemes can be used\nas a tool for policy makers and engineers to design more robust networks and\nidentifying locations which require additional protection efforts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Dec 2013 01:45:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 Dec 2013 11:49:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-25"}

Unlike the case of\n7-knot, where one angular parameter (for a given set of fixed radii) may change\nby sweeping a scissor angle between two chosen cylinders, in case of 8- and\n9-knots their degrees of freedom are completely exhausted by mutual touching so\nthat their configurations are \"frozen\" for each given set of radii.

Stochastic switching between different phenotypes can occur as the\nresult of random fluctuations in molecular copy numbers of mRNA and proteins\narising in transcription, translation, transport, and binding. However, which\ncomponent of a pathway triggers such a transition is generally not known. By\nlinking single-cell experiments on the lactose-uptake pathway in E. coli to\nmolecular simulations, we devise a general method to pinpoint the particular\nfluctuation driving phenotype switching and apply this method to the transition\nbetween the uninduced and induced states of the lac genes.

We confirm this notion in\nstrains with a high expression level of the repressor (leading to shorter\nperiods over which the lac-operon remains unbound), which show a reduced\nswitching rate.

As a result, a complete physical model of these channels must\nnecessarily take quantum effects into account in order to determine their\nultimate performances. Specifically, Gaussian photonic (or bosonic) quantum\nchannels have been extensively studied over the past decades given their\nimportance for practical purposes. In spite of this, a longstanding conjecture\non the optimality of Gaussian encodings has yet prevented finding their\ncommunication capacity. Here, this conjecture is solved by proving that the\nvacuum state achieves the minimum output entropy of a generic Gaussian bosonic\nchannel. This establishes the ultimate achievable bit rate under an energy\nconstraint, as well as the long awaited proof that the single-letter classical\ncapacity of these channels is additive.

The Insulin monomer contains two distinct\nsurfaces, namely the dimer forming surface (DFS) and the hexamer forming\nsurface (HFS) that are specifically designed to facilitate the formation of the\ndimer and the hexamer, respectively. In order to characterize the structural\nand dynamical behaviour of interfacial water molecules near these two surfaces\n(DFS and HFS), we performed atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of Insulin\nwith explicit water. Dynamical characterization reveals that the structural\nrelaxation of the hydrogen bonds formed between the residues of DFS and the\ninterfacial water molecules is faster than those formed between water and that\nof the HFS. Furthermore, the residence times of water molecules in the protein\nhydration layer for both the DFS and HFS are found to be significantly higher\nthan those for some of the other proteins studied so far, such as HP-36 and\nlysozyme. The surface topography and the arrangement of amino acid residues\nwork together to organize the water molecules in the hydration layer in order\nto provide them with a preferred orientation. HFS having a large polar solvent\naccessible surface area and a convex extensive nonpolar region, drives the\nsurrounding water molecules to acquire predominantly a clathrate-like\nstructure. In contrast, near the DFS, the surrounding water molecules acquire\nan inverted orientation owing to the flat curvature of hydrophobic surface and\ninterrupted hydrophilic residual alignment. We have followed escape trajectory\nof several such quasi-bound water molecules from both the surfaces and\nconstructed free energy surfaces of these water molecules.These free energy\nsurfaces reveal the differences between the two hydration layers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Dec 2013 14:16:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-24"}

Further, flops are getting cheaper\nwhile the energy cost of data movement is increasingly dominant. The\nunderstanding and characterization of data locality properties of computations\nis critical in order to guide efforts to enhance data locality. Reuse distance\nanalysis of memory address traces is a valuable tool to perform data locality\ncharacterization of programs. A single reuse distance analysis can be used to\nestimate the number of cache misses in a fully associative LRU cache of any\nsize, thereby providing estimates on the minimum bandwidth requirements at\ndifferent levels of the memory hierarchy to avoid being bandwidth bound.\nHowever, such an analysis only holds for the particular execution order that\nproduced the trace. It cannot estimate potential improvement in data locality\nthrough dependence preserving transformations that change the execution\nschedule of the operations in the computation. In this article, we develop a\nnovel dynamic analysis approach to characterize the inherent locality\nproperties of a computation and thereby assess the potential for data locality\nenhancement via dependence preserving transformations. The execution trace of a\ncode is analyzed to extract a computational directed acyclic graph (CDAG) of\nthe data dependences. The CDAG is then partitioned into convex subsets, and the\nconvex partitioning is used to reorder the operations in the execution trace to\nenhance data locality. The approach enables us to go beyond reuse distance\nanalysis of a single specific order of execution of the operations of a\ncomputation in characterization of its data locality properties. It can serve a\nvaluable role in identifying promising code regions for manual transformation,\nas well as assessing the effectiveness of compiler transformations for data\nlocality enhancement. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach using a\nnumber of benchmarks, including case studies where the potential shown by the\nanalysis is exploited to achieve lower data movement costs and better\nperformance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Dec 2013 08:06:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-21"}
