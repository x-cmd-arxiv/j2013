This\nis the case of inferring the feasible steady states in models of metabolic\nnetworks, since they can show heterogeneous time scales . In this work we focus\non rounding procedures based on building an ellipsoid that closely matches the\nsampling space, that can be used to define an efficient hit-and-run (HR) Markov\nChain Monte Carlo. In this way the uniformity of the sampling of the convex\nspace of interest is rigorously guaranteed, at odds with non markovian methods.\nWe analyze and compare three rounding methods in order to sample the feasible\nsteady states of metabolic networks of three models of growing size up to\ngenomic scale. The first is based on principal component analysis (PCA), the\nsecond on linear programming (LP) and finally we employ the lovasz ellipsoid\nmethod (LEM).

A\nnetwork histogram is obtained by fitting a stochastic blockmodel to a single\nobservation of a network dataset. Blocks of edges play the role of histogram\nbins, and community sizes that of histogram bandwidths or bin sizes. Just as\nstandard histograms allow for varying bandwidths, different blockmodel\nestimates can all be considered valid representations of an underlying\nprobability model, subject to bandwidth constraints. Here we provide methods\nfor automatic bandwidth selection, by which the network histogram approximates\nthe generating mechanism that gives rise to exchangeable random graphs. This\nmakes the blockmodel a universal network representation for unlabeled graphs.\nWith this insight, we discuss the interpretation of network communities in\nlight of the fact that many different community assignments can all give an\nequally valid representation of such a network. To demonstrate the\nfidelity-versus-interpretability tradeoff inherent in considering different\nnumbers and sizes of communities, we analyze two publicly available networks -\npolitical weblogs and student friendships - and discuss how to interpret the\nnetwork histogram when additional information related to node and edge labeling\nis present.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Dec 2013 20:50:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Aug 2014 09:18:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 1 Sep 2014 21:34:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-16"}

In the event of a\ndiscovery of a monojet excess at the 14 TeV LHC, contact interactions between\ndark matter with quarks or with gluons can be differentiated at the 95%\nconfidence level. For a given rate at the LHC, signal predictions at direct\ndetection experiments for different dark matter interactions can span five\norders of magnitude. The ability to identify these interactions allows us to\nmake a tighter connection between LHC searches and direct detection\nexperiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Dec 2013 21:00:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

Here we explore the sensitivity of the tSZ power\nspectrum to important non-gravitational ('sub-grid') physics by employing the\ncosmo-OWLS suite of large-volume cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, run\nin both the Planck and WMAP7 best-fit cosmologies. On intermediate and small\nangular scales (ell > ~1000, or theta < ~10 arcmin), accessible with the South\nPole Telescope and the Atacama Cosmology Telescope, the predicted tSZ power\nspectrum is highly model dependent, with AGN feedback having a particularly\nlarge effect. However, at large scales, observable with the Planck telescope,\nthe effects of sub-grid physics are minor. Comparing the simulations with\nobservations, we find a significant amplitude offset on all measured angular\nscales (including large scales), if the Planck best-fit cosmology is assumed by\nthe simulations. This is shown to be a generic result for all current tSZ\nmodels. By contrast, if the WMAP7 cosmology is adopted, there is full\nconsistency with the Planck power spectrum measurements on large scales and\nagreement at the 2 sigma level with the SPT/ACT measurements at intermediate\nscales for our fiducial AGN model, which Le Brun et al.

These\nstars lose up to 80% of their mass to strong line-driven winds and explode as\nbare He cores. We find that their light curves and spectra are quite different\nfrom those of Population III pair-instability explosions, which therefore\ncannot be used as templates for low-redshift events. Although non-zero\nmetallicity pair-instability supernovae are generally dimmer than their\nPopulation III counterparts, in some cases they will be bright enough to be\ndetected at the earliest epochs at which they can occur, the formation of the\nfirst galaxies at $z \\sim$ 10 - 15. Others can masquerade as dim, short\nduration supernovae that are only visible in the local universe and that under\nthe right conditions could be hidden in a wide variety of supernova classes. We\nalso report for the first time that some pair-instability explosions can create\nblack holes with masses of $\\sim$ 100 M$_{\\odot}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Dec 2013 22:26:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Sep 2014 02:14:23 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 30 Nov 2014 08:54:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

In particular, magnetic\nreconnection during collisionless, stressed $X$-point collapse for varying\nout-of-plane guide-fields is studied using a kinetic, 2.5D, fully\nelectromagnetic, relativistic particle-in-cell numerical code. Cases for both\nopen and closed boundary conditions are investigated, where magnetic flux and\nparticles are lost and conserved respectively. It is found that reconnection\nrates and out-of-plane currents in the $X$-point increase more rapidly and peak\nsooner in the closed boundary case, but higher values are reached in the open\nboundary case. The normalized reconnection rate is fast: 0.10-0.25. In the open\nboundary case an increase of guide-field yields later onsets in the\nreconnection peak rates, while in the closed boundary case initial peak rates\noccur sooner but are suppressed. The reconnection current increases for low\nguide-fields but then decreases similarly. In the open boundary case, for\nguide-fields of the order of the in-plane magnetic field, the generation of\nelectron vortices occurs. Possible causes of the vortex generation, based on\nthe flow of particles in the diffusion region and localized plasma heating, are\ndiscussed. Before peak reconnection onset, oscillations in the out-of-plane\nelectric field at the $X$-point are found, ranging in frequency from\napproximately 1 to 2 $\\omega_{pe}$ and coinciding with oscillatory\nreconnection. These oscillations are found to be part of a larger wave pattern.\nMapping the out-of-plane electric field over time and applying 2D Fourier\ntransforms reveals that the waves predominantly correspond to the ordinary mode\nand may correspond to observable radio waves such as solar radio burst fine\nstructure spikes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Dec 2013 23:05:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-12"}

Because each iteration consists of solving a series of convex\nproblems that contain all previous solutions, the likelihood of the models in\nthe sequence is increasing with each iteration while the dimension of the model\nparameter space is set to a limited controlled value.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Dec 2013 03:24:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Feb 2014 20:32:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-18"}

The EMPA data show\nthat three samples fall into the compositional field of fluoro-edenite whereas\ntwo samples are enriched in high-charged C cations, and must be classified as\nfluoro-pargasite. Mg is by far the dominant C cation, Ca is the dominant B\ncation (with BNa in the range 0.00-0.05 apfu, atoms per formula unit), and Na\nis the dominant A cation, with A0 (vacancy) in the range 0.07-0.21 apfu; WF is\nin the range 1.18-1.46 apfu. SREF data show that: TAl is completely ordered at\nthe T(1) site; the M(1) site is occupied only by divalent cations (Mg and\nFe2+); CAl is disordered between the M(2) and M(3) sites; ANa is ordered at the\nA(m) site, as expected in F-rich compositions.

We cross-correlate sky maps from\nPlanck, WMAP, and DIRBE, at 17 frequencies from 23 to 3000 GHz, with the Parkes\nsurvey of the 21-cm line emission of neutral atomic hydrogen, over a contiguous\narea of 7500 deg$^2$ centred on the southern Galactic pole.

We interpret this result\nas evidence for dust evolution within the diffuse ISM. The mean dust opacity is\nmeasured to be $(7.1 \\pm 0.6) 10^{-27} cm^2/H \\times (\\nu/353\\,\nGHz)^{1.53\\pm0.03}$ for $100 < \\nu <353$GHz.

(3) We present spectral fits of the\nmicrowave emission correlated with HI from 23 to 353 GHz, which separate dust\nand anomalous microwave emission. The flattening of the dust SED can be\naccounted for with an additional component with a blackbody spectrum, which\naccounts for $(26 \\pm 6)$% of the dust emission at 100 GHz and could represent\nmagnetic dipole emission. Alternatively, it could account for an increasing\ncontribution of carbon dust, or a flattening of the emissivity of amorphous\nsilicates, at millimetre wavelengths.

Besides powerful machine learning tools for\nclassification and retrieval, a key component for successful recommendation is\nthe \\emph{audio content representation}.\n  Good representations should capture informative musical patterns in the audio\nsignal of songs. These representations should be concise, to enable efficient\n(low storage, easy indexing, fast search) management of huge music\nrepositories, and should also be easy and fast to compute, to enable real-time\ninteraction with a user supplying new songs to the system.\n  Before designing new audio features, we explore the usage of traditional\nlocal features, while adding a stage of encoding with a pre-computed\n\\emph{codebook} and a stage of pooling to get compact vectorial\nrepresentations.

PARAS is capable of a single-shot spectral coverage of 3800A - 9500A\nat a resolution of about 67,000. The RV results were obtained between 3800A and\n6900A using simultaneous wavelength calibration with a Thorium-Argon (ThAr)\nhollow cathode lamp. The spectrograph is maintained under stable conditions of\ntemperature with a precision of 0.01 - 0.02C (rms) at 25.55C, and enclosed in a\nvacuum vessel at pressure of 0.1 +/-0.03 mbar. The blaze peak efficiency of the\nspectrograph between 5000A and 6500A, including the detector, is 30%; and about\n25% with the fiber transmission. The total efficiency, including spectrograph,\nfiber transmission, focal ratio degradation (FRD), and telescope (with 81%\nreflectivity) is about 7% in the same wavelength region on a clear night with\ngood seeing conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Dec 2013 10:36:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

It describes near-horizon geometries of M2 branes\nending on, or intersecting with, M5 branes along a common string. The general\nsolution to the BPS equations is specified by a reduced set of data (\\gamma, h,\nG), where \\gamma is the real parameter of the isometry superalgebra, and h and\nG are functions on \\Sigma whose differential equations and regularity\nconditions depend only on the sign of \\gamma. The magnitude of \\gamma enters\nonly through the map of h, G onto the supergravity fields, thereby promoting\nall solutions into families parametrized by |\\gamma|. By analyzing the\nregularity conditions for the supergravity fields, we prove two general\ntheorems: (i) that the only solution with a 2-dimensional CFT dual is AdS_3 x\nS^3 x S^3 x R^2, modulo discrete identifications of the flat R^2, and (ii) that\nsolutions with \\gamma < 0 cannot have more than one asymptotic\nhigher-dimensional AdS region.

They are,\nthus, a key determinant of the most important biogeochemical cycles in the\nplanet. Therefore, a correct description of the ecological and evolutionary\nbehavior of these viruses is essential to make reliable predictions about their\nrole in marine ecosystems. The infection cycle, for example, is indistinctly\nmodeled in two very different ways. In one representation, the process is\ndescribed including explicitly a fixed delay between infection and offspring\nrelease. In the other, the offspring are released at exponentially distributed\ntimes according to a fixed release rate. By considering obvious quantitative\ndifferences pointed out in the past, the latter description is widely used as a\nsimplification of the former. However, it is still unclear how the dichotomy\n\"delay versus rate description\" affects long-term predictions of host-virus\ninteraction models.

Such an ability might play a major role in post-transcriptional\nregulation (PTR) in shaping a cell's protein repertoire. Recent work focusing\non the emergent properties of the cross-talk networks has emphasized the high\nflexibility and selectivity that may be achieved at stationarity. On the other\nhand, dynamical aspects, possibly crucial on the relevant time scales, are far\nless clear. We have carried out a dynamical study of the ceRNA hypothesis on a\nmodel of PTR. Sensitivity analysis shows that ceRNA cross-talk is dynamically\nextended, i.e. it may take place on time scales shorter than those required to\nachieve stationairity even in cases where no cross-talk occurs in the steady\nstate, and is possibly amplified. Besides, in case of large, transfection-like\nperturbations the system may develop strongly non-linear, threshold response.\nFinally, we show that the ceRNA effect provides a very efficient way for a cell\nto achieve fast positive shifts in the level of a ceRNA when necessary. These\nresults indicate that competition for miRNAs may indeed provide an elementary\nmechanism to achieve system-level regulatory effects on the transcriptome over\nphysiologically relevant time scales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Dec 2013 13:24:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

The problem is focusing when g\n>= 1, and in this case we prove that for nonnegative integer-valued\nequivariance indices m there exist constants c = c_{m, g} such that, at the\ncritical regularity, the initial value problem is globally wellposed and the\nsolution scatters when the L^2 initial data phi_0 is m-equivariant and has\nL^2-norm less than the square root of c_{m, g}. We also show that c_{m,\ng}^{1/2} is equal to the minimum L^2 norm of a nontrivial m-equivariant\nstanding wave solution. In the self-dual g = 1 case, we have the exact\nnumerical values c_{m, 1} = 8*pi*(m + 1).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Dec 2013 14:40:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 8 Feb 2014 00:51:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-11"}

The features which occur\nin this domain are examined in relation to the physical phenomena: interaction\nof the electromagnetic waves with the moving sea surface.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Dec 2013 16:27:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-23"}

Our novel boundary integral equations result from\nsuitable representations of the fields inside and outside the scatterer as\ncombinations of single and double layer potentials acting on suitably defined\nregularizing operators. The regularizing operators are constructed to be\nsuitable approximations of the admittance operators that map the transmission\nboundary conditions to the exterior and respectively interior Cauchy data on\nthe interface between the media. The latter operators can be expressed in terms\nof Dirichlet-to-Neumann operators. We refer to these regularized boundary\nintegral equations as Generalized Combined Source Integral Equations (GCSIE).\nThe ensuing GCSIE are shown to be integral equations of the second kind in the\ncase when the interface of material discontinuity is a smooth curve in two\ndimensions and a smooth surface in three dimensions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Dec 2013 15:05:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-24"}

The\ngrid topology plays an important role in determining the dynamics of cascading\nfailures in power grids. Measures for vulnerability analysis are crucial to\nassure a higher level of robustness of power grids. Metrics from Complex\nNetworks are widely used to investigate the grid vulnerability. Yet, these\npurely topological metrics fail to capture the real behaviour of power grids.\nThis paper proposes a metric, the effective graph resistance, as a\nvulnerability measure to de- termine the critical components in a power grid.\nDifferently than the existing purely topological measures, the effective graph\nresistance accounts for the electrical properties of power grids such as power\nflow allocation according to Kirchoff laws. To demonstrate the applicability of\nthe effective graph resistance, a quantitative vulnerability assessment of the\nIEEE 118 buses power system is performed. The simulation results verify the\neffectiveness of the effective graph resistance to identify the critical\ntransmission lines in a power grid.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Dec 2013 10:48:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-24"}

In contrast,\nthis paper studies the case of a bufferless queue that drops arriving packets\nwhile a packet is in service. Under this bufferless model, the paper provides\nupper bounds on the capacity of timing channels and establishes achievable\nrates for the case of bufferless M/M/1 and M/G/1 queues. In particular, it is\nshown that a bufferless M/M/1 queue at worst suffers less than 10% reduction in\ncapacity when compared to an M/M/1 work-conserving queue.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Dec 2013 22:43:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-06"}
