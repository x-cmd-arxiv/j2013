We begin with\ncalculating degrees of alignment of small (size $a\\sim 0.01\\mu$m) and very\nsmall ($a\\sim 0.001\\mu$m) grains in the interstellar magnetic field due to the\nDavis-Greenstein paramagnetic relaxation and resonance paramagnetic relaxation.\nWe compute the degrees of paramagnetic alignment with the ambient magnetic\nfield $B$ using Langevin equations. In this paper, we take into account various\nprocesses essential for the dynamics of small grains, including infrared (IR)\nemission, electric dipole emission, plasma drag and collisions with neutral and\nionized species. We find that the alignment of small grains is necessary to\nreproduce the observed polarization in the UV, although the polarization\narising from these small grains is negligible at the optical and IR\nwavelengths. Based on fitting theoretical models to observed extinction and\npolarization curves, we find that the best-fit model requires a higher degree\nof alignment of small grains for the case with the peak wavelength of\npolarization $\\lambda_{\\max}<0.55\\mu$m, which exhibits an excess UV\npolarization relative to the Serkowski law, compared to the typical case\n$\\lambda_{\\max}=0.55\\mu$m. We interpret the correlation between the systematic\nincrease of the UV polarization relative to maximum polarization (i.e. of\n$p(6\\mu m^{-1})/p_{\\max}$) with $\\lambda_{\\max}^{-1}$ by appealing to the\nhigher degree of alignment of small grains. We identify paramagnetic relaxation\nas the cause of the alignment of small grains and utilize the dependence of the\ndegree of alignment on the magnetic field strength $B$ to suggest a new way to\nmeasure $B$ using the observable parameters $\\lambda_{\\max}$ and $p(6\\mu\nm^{-1})/p_{\\max}$.[Abridged]\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Dec 2013 16:23:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 24 May 2014 20:21:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-10"}

In particular, other distributions have\nbeen proposed to better fit observations, for example, kappa- and\n$n$-distributions. If present, these distributions will generate radio\nemissions with different observable properties compared with the classical\ngyroresonance (GR) or free-free emission, which implies a way of remote\ndetecting these non-Maxwellian distributions in the radio observations. Here we\npresent analytically derived GR and free-free emissivities and absorption\ncoefficients for the kappa- and $n$-distributions and discuss their properties,\nwhich are in fact remarkably different from each other and from the classical\nMaxwellian plasma.

This property has a remarkable\nconsequence allowing a straightforward observational test: the gyroresonance\nradio emission from the non-Maxwellian distributions is supposed to be\nnoticeably polarized even in the optically thick case, where the emission would\nhave strictly zero polarization in the case of Maxwellian plasma.

The\nfirst one follows the observation that the classical definition of derivatives\ninvolves prospective (or forward) difference quotients, not known whenever the\ntime is directed, at least at the macroscopic level. Actually, the available\nand known derivatives are retrospective (or backward). They co\\\"incide whenever\nthe functions are differentiable in the classical sense, but not in the case of\nnon smooth maps, single-valued or set-valued. The later ones are used in\ndifferential inclusions (and thus, in uncertain control systems) governing\nevolutions in function of time and state. We follow the plea of some physicists\nfor taking also into account the retrospective derivatives to study prospective\nevolutions in function of time, state and retrospective derivatives, a\nparticular, but specific, example of historical of ''path dependent''\nevolutionary systems. This is even more crucial in life sciences, in the\nabsence of experimentation of uncertain evolutionary systems. The second\nmotivation emerged from the study of networks with junctions (cross-roads in\ntraffic networks, synapses in neural networks, banks in financial networks,\netc.), an important feature of ''complex systems''. At each junction, the\nvelocities of the incoming (retrospective) and outgoing (prospective)\nevolutions are confronted. One measure of this confrontation (''jerkiness'') is\nprovided by the product of the retrospective and prospective velocities,\nnegative in ''inhibitory'' junctions, positive for ''excitatory'' ones, for\ninstance. This leads to the introduction of the ''differential connection\ntensor'' of two evolutions, defined as the tensor product of retrospective and\nprospective derivatives, which can be used for controlling evolutionary systems\ngoverning the evolutions through networks with junctions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Dec 2013 19:17:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-10"}

A\n''junction relation'' (crossroads, synapses, clearing houses, etc.) Is a subset\nof the transport relation made of junction states? The objective is to\nconstruct a ''transport regulator'' associating with traffic states a set of\n''celerities'' that mobiles circulating in the network can use as velocities.\nIn other word, a network is regarded as a ''provider of velocity information''\nto the mobiles for travelling from one departure state to an arrival state\nacross a junction relation (a kind of geodesic problem).

This allows non trivial savings in repair BW. In sharp\ncontrast, classic codes, like Reed- Solomon (RS), used in current storage\nsystems, are deemed to suffer from naive repair, i.e. downloading the entire\nstored message to repair one failed node. This mainly happens because they are\nscalar-linear. In this work, we present a simple framework that treats scalar\ncodes as vector-linear. In some cases, this allows significant savings in\nrepair BW. We show that vectorized scalar codes exhibit properties that\nsimplify the design of repair schemes.

The planets have been listed in order of\nincreasing orbital periods. All three bodies are embedded in a locally\nisothermal gaseous disc and orbit around a solar mass star. We are interested\nin answering the following question: Will the low-mass planets form the same\nresonant structures with each other in the vicinity of the gas giant as in the\ncase when the gas giant is absent? When there is no gas giant in the system, it\nhas been already shown that if the two low-mass planets undergo a convergent\ndifferential migration, they will capture each other in a mean-motion\nresonance. For the choices of disc parameters and planet masses made in this\npaper, the formation of the 5:4 resonance in the absence of the Jupiter has\nbeen observed. In this work we add a gas giant on the most external orbit of\nthe system in such a way that its differential migration is convergent with the\nlow-mass planets. We show that the result of this set-up is the speeding up of\nthe migration of the super-Earth and, after that, all three planets become\nlocked in a triple mean-motion resonance. However, this resonance is not\nmaintained due to the low-mass planet eccentricity excitation, a fact that\nleads to close encounters between planets and eventually to the ejection from\nthe internal orbits of one or both low-mass planets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Dec 2013 22:13:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

Ab initio and molecular mechanics\nwere employed to probe the binding energies of vacancies and segregation\nenergies of Ga for <100>, <110> and <111> STGBs in Al. We found that the GB\nlocal arrangements and resulting structural units have a significant influence\non the magnitude of vacancy binding energies. For example, the mean vacancy\nbinding energy for <100>, <110>, and <111> STGBs at 1st layer was found to be\n-0.63 eV, -0.26 eV, and -0.60 eV. However, some GBs exhibited vacancy binding\nenergies closer to bulk values, indicating interfaces with zero sink strength,\ni.e., these GBs may not provide effective pathways for vacancy diffusion. The\nresults from the present work showed that the GB structure and the associated\nfree volume also play significant roles in Ga segregation and the subsequent\nembrittlement of Al. The Ga mean segregation energy for <100>, <110> and <111>\nSTGBs at 1st layer was found to be -0.23 eV, -0.12 eV and -0.24 eV,\nrespectively, suggesting a stronger correlation between the GB structural unit,\nits free volume, and segregation behavior. Furthermore, as the GB free volume\nincreased, the difference in segregation energies between the 1st layer and the\n0th layer increased. Thus, the GB character and free volume provide an\nimportant key to understanding the degree of anisotropy in various systems. The\noverall characteristic Ga absorption length scale was found to be about ~10, 8,\nand 12 layers for <100>, <110>, and <111> STGBs, respectively.

However, the host (the owner of an online social platform) often\nfaces more constraints than a single product, endless user attentions,\nunlimited budget and unbounded time; in reality, multiple products need to be\nadvertised, each user can tolerate only a small number of recommendations,\ninfluencing user has a cost and advertisers have only limited budgets, and the\nadoptions need to be maximized within a short time window.\n  Given theses myriads of user, monetary, and timing constraints, it is\nextremely challenging for the host to design principled and efficient viral\nmarket algorithms with provable guarantees. In this paper, we provide a novel\nsolution by formulating the problem as a submodular maximization in a\ncontinuous-time diffusion model under an intersection of a matroid and multiple\nknapsack constraints. We also propose an adaptive threshold greedy algorithm\nwhich can be faster than the traditional greedy algorithm with lazy evaluation,\nand scalable to networks with million of nodes. Furthermore, our mathematical\nformulation allows us to prove that the algorithm can achieve an approximation\nfactor of $k_a/(2+2 k)$ when $k_a$ out of the $k$ knapsack constraints are\nactive, which also improves over previous guarantees from combinatorial\noptimization literature.

Due to\nhigh leakage consumption of SRAM device, caches designed with SRAM consume\nlarge amount of energy. To address this, use of emerging technologies such as\nspin torque transfer RAM (STT-RAM) has been investigated which have lower\nleakage power dissipation. However, the high write latency and power of it may\nlead to large energy consumption which present challenges in its use. In this\nreport, we propose a cache reconfiguration based technique for improving the\nenergy efficiency of STT-RAM based LLCs. Our technique dynamically adjusts the\nactive cache size to reduce the cache leakage energy consumption with minimum\nperformance loss. We choose a suitable value of STT-RAM retention time for\navoiding refresh overhead and gaining performance.

One type is ``woolly'' with massive clumpy arms all\nover the disk and is brighter than other disk galaxies at the same redshift,\nwhile another type has irregular multiple arms with high pitch angles, star\nformation knots and no inner symmetry like today's multiple-arm galaxies.

Our work indicates that it is not the\ndepth of the cracks per se that governs MT dynamic instability. Instead it is\nwhether the cracks terminate in GTP-rich or GDP-rich areas of the MT that\ngoverns whether a particular MT tip structure is likely to grow, shrink, or\ntransition: the identity of the crack-terminating subunit pairs has a profound\ninfluence on the moment-by-moment behavior of the MT.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Dec 2013 14:29:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-09"}

The term effect indicates that it\nrepresents causal information, which is different from standard statistical\nconcepts as regression coefficient and association. The process of inferring\ncausal information is also different from standard statistical learning, as the\nformer requires causal (i.e. non-statistical) assumptions and involves extra\ncomplexities. Remarkably, the task of inferring genetic effects is largely seen\nas a standard regression/prediction problem, contradicting its label. This\nwidely accepted analysis approach is by itself insufficient for causal\nlearning, suggesting that causality is not the point for selection. Given this\nincongruence, it is important to verify if genomic predictors need to represent\ncausal effects to be relevant for selection decisions, especially because\napplying regression studies to answer causal questions may lead to wrong\nconclusions. The answer to this question defines if genomic selection models\nshould be constructed aiming maximum genomic predictive ability or aiming\nidentifiability of genetic causal effects. Here, we demonstrate that selection\nrelies on a causal effect from genotype to phenotype, and that genomic\npredictors are only useful for selection if they distinguish such effect from\nother sources of association. Conversely, genomic predictors capturing\nnon-causal signals provide information that is less relevant for selection\nregardless of the resulting predictive ability. Focusing on covariate choice\ndecision, simulated examples are used to show that predictive ability, which is\nthe criterion normally used to compare models, may not indicate the quality of\ngenomic predictors for selection. Additionally, we propose using alternative\ncriteria to construct models aiming for the identification of the genetic\ncausal effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Dec 2013 21:45:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-27"}
