For simple spherical particles, the time dependent growth of\nfluid domains is dominated by the formation of droplets, particle adsorption\nand coalescence of droplets (Ostwald ripening), which eventually can be almost\nfully blocked due to the presence of the particles. Ellipsoidal particles are\nknown to be more efficient stabilizers of fluid interfaces than spherical\nparticles and their anisotropic shape and the related additional rotational\ndegrees of freedom have an impact on the dynamics of emulsion formation. In\nthis paper, we investigate this point by means of simple model systems\nconsisting of a single ellipsoidal particle or a particle ensemble at a flat\ninterface as well as a particle ensemble at a spherical interface. By applying\ncombined multicomponent lattice Boltzmann and molecular dynamics simulations we\ndemonstrate that the anisotropic shape of ellipsoidal particles causes two\nadditional timescales to be of relevance in the dynamics of emulsion formation:\na relatively short timescale can be attributed to the adsorption of single\nparticles and the involved rotation of particles towards the interface. As soon\nas the interface is jammed, however, capillary interactions between the\nparticles cause a local reordering on very long timescales leading to a\ncontinuous change in the interface configuration and increase of interfacial\narea. This effect can be utilized to counteract the thermodynamic instability\nof particle stabilized emulsions and thus offers the possibility to produce\nemulsions with exceptional stability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Dec 2013 16:27:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Apr 2014 15:12:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-10"}

We\nstudy the production cross section at the LHC of $L^{++}$ ($pp \\rightarrow\nL^{++} \\, \\ell^{-}$) and focus on the leptonic signature deriving from the\nsubsequent decays $L^{++} \\rightarrow W^{+} \\ell^{+} \\rightarrow \\ell^{+} \\\n\\ell^{+} \\, \\nu_l $. The invariant mass distribution of the like-sign dilepton\nexhibits a sharp end-point corresponding to excited doubly charged lepton mass\n$m^{*}$. A preliminary study for the production of doubly charged leptons at\nthe future linear colliders, by considering the process $e^{-} e^{-}\n\\rightarrow L_{e}^{--} \\, \\nu_{e}$, is carried out. Both the contact and gauge\ninteraction mechanisms are investigated and compared.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Dec 2013 17:17:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Jan 2014 18:29:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 20 Feb 2014 17:13:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-26"}

It is well\nknown that the inverses of banded matrices exhibit an exponential decay pattern\naway from the main diagonal. However, the entries in $S^{-1}$ show a\nnon-monotonic decay, which is not caught by classical bounds. By using an\nalternative expression for $S^{-1}$, we derive computable upper bounds that\nclosely capture the actual behavior of its entries. We also show that similar\nestimates can be obtained when $M$ has a larger bandwidth, or when the sum of\nKronecker products involves two different matrices.

Each past event\nof the worldline has occurred once as a nowpoint, and we take there to be an\never-changing present now-point 'marking' the unfolding of a physical system.\nIn Dieks' approach there is no preferred worldline and only along each\nworldline is there a Newtonian-like linear order between successive now-points.\nWe have a flow of time per worldline. Also there is no global temporal order of\nthe now-points of different worldlines. There is, as much, what Dieks calls a\npartial order.

For this reason, the mechanism of this interaction and its dependence\nwith distance $d$ between these nanoobjects has been the subject of several\nrecent studies. In the present work, the problem of the interaction between\nmagnetic nanodisks with magnetic vortex structures is treated both analytically\nand through micromagnetic simulation. The coupling of two magnetic nanodisks is\nobtained, in the case of nanodisks with different gyrotropic frequencies. The\nmotion of the two vortex cores, and consequently the time dependence of the\ntotal magnetization $M(t)$ is derived using Thiele's equation and by\nsimulation. The magnetic coupling strength as a function of the distance\nbetween the disks of each pair is computed with a recently developed method,\nusing the magnetic vortex echoes, analogous to the NMR spin echoes. The results\nof the two approaches differ by approximately $10\\%$ and can be fitted with a\nmultipolar expansion of odd negative powers of $d$; using one single term, a\ndependence with distance found is broadly in agreement with studies employing\nother techniques. The coupling frequencies as a function of distance for the\npair of nonidentical disks are also obtained.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Dec 2013 20:17:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Jan 2014 18:59:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

Likewise, the analogous\ninteraction of an axion field with the axial-vector current generated by a\nnucleon can give rise to time-dependent mixing of opposite-parity states in\nnuclear systems. This mixing can induce oscillating electric dipole moments,\noscillating parity non-conservation effects and oscillating anapole moments in\nsuch systems. By adjusting the energy separation between the opposite-parity\nstates of interest to match the axion mass energy, axion-induced experimental\nobservables can be enhanced by many orders of magnitude.

An antiferromagnetic insulating\n(AFI) state, possibly associated with charge ordering, emerges upon thermal\nannealing. The Hall effect in these materials exhibits features that are\nindicative of a percolative phase transition and correlate closely with the\nemergence of the AFI state. In the paramagnetic phase, the Hall resistivity\ntakes on two slopes in all samples: a decreasing negative slope with increasing\ntemperature at low fields, which is attributed to the carrier hopping motion,\nand an almost temperature independent positive slope at high fields due to\ndiffusive transport of holes. Significantly, the crossover fields of the Hall\nresistivity slope at different temperatures correspond to the same\nmagnetization, which is interpreted as the critical point of a magnetic\nfield-driven percolative phase transition. At lower temperatures near the\nzero-field metal-insulator transition, pronounced enhancement of the Hall\ncoefficient with the development of the AFI state is observed. The enhancement\npeaks near the magnetic field-driven percolation; its magnitude correlates with\nthe strength of the AFI state and is suppressed with the melting of the AFI\nstate by an in-plane magnetic field. The observations resemble many features of\nthe enhancement of the Hall coefficient in granular metal films near the\ncomposition-driven percolation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Dec 2013 20:42:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-24"}

Models to explain these offsets usually invoke broad-line region\ngas kinematics/asymmetry around single black holes (BHs), orbital motion of\nmassive (~sub-pc) binary black holes (BBHs), or recoil BHs, but single-epoch\nspectra are unable to distinguish between these scenarios. The line-of-sight\n(LOS) radial velocity (RV) shifts from long-term spectroscopic monitoring can\nbe used to test the BBH hypothesis. We have selected a sample of 399 quasars\nwith offset broad H-beta lines from the SDSS DR7 quasar catalog, and have\nconducted second-epoch optical spectroscopy for 50 of them. Combined with the\nexisting SDSS spectra, the new observations enable us to constrain the LOS RV\nshifts of broad H-beta lines with a rest-frame baseline of a few years to\nnearly a decade. Using cross-correlation analysis, we detect significant (99%\nconfidence) radial accelerations in the broad H-beta lines in 24 of the 50\nobjects. We suggest that 9 of the 24 detections are sub-pc BBH candidates,\nwhich show consistent velocity shifts independently measured from a second\nbroad line (either H-alpha or Mg II) without significant changes in the\nbroad-line profiles. Combining the results on the general quasar population\nstudied in Paper I, we find a tentative anti-correlation between the velocity\noffset in the first-epoch spectrum and the average acceleration between two\nepochs, which could be explained by orbital phase modulation when the time\nseparation between two epochs is a non-negligible fraction of the orbital\nperiod of the motion causing the line displacement. We discuss the implications\nof our results for the identification of sub-pc BBH candidates in offset-line\nquasars and for the constraints on their frequency and orbital parameters.\n[Abridged]\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Dec 2013 21:02:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 14 Jun 2014 02:44:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

Here we observe that\nthe rate of increase in distortion decreases with the increase in R-ion radii.\nThis occurs due to the reduction in the compression of RO12 polyhedra with a\ncorresponding increase in the compression of the CrO6 octahedra with increasing\nR-ion radii. From the Raman studies, we predict a critical R-ion radii, above\nwhich we expect the distortions in RCrO3 to reduce with increasing pressure\nleading to what is observed in the case of LaCrO3.

A simple relation between the\nproduct of the specific heat and the determinant of the moment of inertia in\nboth the canonical and the grand-canonical ensembles is derived.

This paper analyzes the disadvantage\nof existing broadcast routing protocols in VANETs, and proposes an improved\nalgorithm (namely ODAM-C) based on the ODAM (Optimized Dissemination of Alarm\nMessages) protocol. The ODAM-C algorithm improves the packet delivery rate by\ntwo mechanisms based on the forwarding features of ODAM. The first\ndistance-based mechanism reduces the possibility of packet loss by considering\nthe angles between source nodes, forwarding nodes and receiving nodes. The\nsecond mechanism increases the redundancy of forwarding nodes to guarantee the\npacket success delivery ratio. We show by analysis and simulations that the\nproposed algorithm can improve packet delivery rate for vehicular networks\ncompared against two widely-used existing protocols.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Dec 2013 14:35:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-25"}

One crucial problem in big data\nanalytics is the selection of representative instances from large and\nmassively-distributed data, which is formally known as the Column Subset\nSelection (CSS) problem. The solution to this problem enables data analysts to\nunderstand the insights of the data and explore its hidden structure. The\nselected instances can also be used for data preprocessing tasks such as\nlearning a low-dimensional embedding of the data points or computing a low-rank\napproximation of the corresponding matrix. This paper presents a fast and\naccurate greedy algorithm for large-scale column subset selection.

The paper\nfirst presents a centralized greedy algorithm for column subset selection which\ndepends on a novel recursive formula for calculating the reconstruction error\nof the data matrix. The paper then presents a MapReduce algorithm which selects\na few representative columns from a matrix whose columns are massively\ndistributed across several commodity machines. The algorithm first learns a\nconcise representation of all columns using random projection, and it then\nsolves a generalized column subset selection problem at each machine in which a\nsubset of columns are selected from the sub-matrix on that machine such that\nthe reconstruction error of the concise representation is minimized.

We show that van-der-Waals shifts can significantly\nmodify the exciton wave function, whenever atoms approach each other closely.\nAs a result, attractive excitons and repulsive van-der-Waals interactions can\nbe combined to form stable one-dimensional atom chains, akin to bound\naggregates. Here the van-der-Waals shifts ensure a stronger homogeneous\ndelocalisation of a single excitation over the whole chain, enabling it to bind\nup to six atoms. When brought into unstable configurations, such Rydberg\naggregates allow the direct monitoring of their dissociation dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Dec 2013 20:43:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-30"}

The\n*-Algebra R is the set of all dynamic variables of the QSINP, in which a\nspecial addition and multiplication operations were defined. The full pure\nstate vector (FPSV) \\rho, the pure state vector {\\rho_f} and the equivalent\nrelations within them are also well defined. The set of all pure state vectors,\nwhich are equivalent to the FPSV \\rho, is a Hilbert Space {H_\\rho}, if the\naddition, the inner product and the norm were defined in it. The set of all\nlinear transformation {N_\\rho} on {H_\\rho} is isomorphic to R, and\n{{N_\\rho},{H_\\rho}} is the representation of R, associated with \\rho. The\n*-Algebra R has infinitely many non-equivalent irreducible GNS constructions\n(representations), associated with different nonequivalent FPSVs respectively.\n  It is proved that, the dynamical motions of the QSINP is totally within the\nGNS construction associated with the initial pure state vector; However, the\ntime reversal transformation makes the initial FPSV and its corresponding\ndynamical evolution into another non-equivalent GNS construction. Therefore,\nwithin the GNS construction associated with the FPSV, the dynamics of the QSINP\nis time irreversible.\n  Finally, due to the Liouville operator has real continuous spectrum within\nthe GNS construction, the longtime asymptotic solution of Liouville equation in\nthe GNS construction could be treated by the formal scattering theory. The\nMaster equation with dissipative term was obtained, which is formally\nirrelevant of the initial state and the corresponding GNS construction. This\nmaster equation could be regarded as the evolution equation of the QSINP on R.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Dec 2013 07:06:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-31"}
