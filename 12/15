This paper is about cubic sand grains moving around on nicely packed\ncolumns in one dimension (the physical sandpile is two dimensional, but the\nsupport of sand columns is one dimensional). The Kadanoff Sandpile Model is a\ndiscrete dynamical system describing the evolution of a finite number of\nstacked grains --as they would fall from an hourglass-- to a stable\nconfiguration (fixed point). Grains move according to the repeated application\nof a simple local rule until reaching a fixed point.

In this paper we prove the emergence of wave patterns\nperiodically repeated on fixed points. Remarkably, those regular patterns do\nnot cover the entire fixed point, but eventually emerge from a seemingly highly\ndisordered segment.

The structure of the\nflow is defined in terms of asymptotically-matched thin-layers, namely the\nsurface layer and a critical layer, whether it is elevated or immersed,\ncorresponding to its location above or within the surface layer. The results\nparticularly demonstrate the physical importance of the singular flow features\nand physical implications of the elevated critical layer in the limit of the\nunsteadiness tending to zero. These agree with the variational mathematical\nsolution of Miles (1957) for small but finite growth rate, but they are not\nconsistent physically or mathematically with his analysis in the limit of\ngrowth rate tending to zero. As this and other studies conclude, in the limit\nof zero growth rate the effect of the elevated critical layer is eliminated by\nfinite turbulent diffusivity, so that the perturbed flow and the drag force are\ndetermined by the asymmetric or sheltering flow in the surface shear layer and\nits matched interaction with the upper region. But for groups of waves, in\nwhich the individual waves grow and decay, there is a net contribution of the\nelevated critical layer to the wave growth. Critical layers, whether elevated\nor immersed, affect this asymmetric sheltering mechanism, but in quite a\ndifferent way to their effect on growing waves. These asymptotic multi-layer\nmethods lead to physical insight and suggest approximate methods for analyzing\nhigher amplitude and more complex flows, such as flow over wave groups.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Dec 2013 19:46:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-17"}

To study the physics of gas heating in cluster\nmergers, we investigated hard X-ray emission from the merging cluster A2163,\nwhich hosts the brightest synchrotron radio halo. We analyzed hard X-ray\nspectra accumulated from two-pointed Suzaku observations. Non-thermal hard\nX-ray emission should result from the inverse Compton (IC) scattering of\nrelativistic electrons by the CMB photons. To measure this emission, the\ndominant thermal emission in the hard X-ray band must be modeled in detail. To\nthis end, we analyzed the combined broad-band X-ray data of A2163 collected by\nSuzaku and XMM-Newton, assuming single- and multi-temperature models for\nthermal emission and the power-law model for non-thermal emission. From the\nSuzaku data, we detected significant hard X-ray emission from A2163 in the\n12-60 keV band at the $28\\sigma$ level (or at the $5.5\\sigma$ level if a\nsystematic error is considered).

In both\nsituations, competition and saturation have the same underlying cause, which is\nthat the generation of resources occur at a finite velocity per individual of\nthe providing species, but their depletion happens much faster due to the\nacceleration in growth rates that characterizes mutualism.

When using controls obtained from classical dynamics for\nwavepacket propagation, wavepacket squeezing is the only quantum effect that\ncomes into play for a large range of trapping parameters.
