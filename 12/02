Such overfrustrated and\nunderfrustrated Ising systems on hierarchical lattices in d=3 and 2 are\nstudied. With the removal of just 51 % of frustration, a spin-glass phase\noccurs in d=2. With the addition of just 33 % frustration, the spin-glass phase\ndisappears in d=3. Sequences of 18 different phase diagrams for different\nlevels of frustration are calculated in both dimensions. In general,\nfrustration lowers the spin-glass ordering temperature. At low temperatures,\nincreased frustration favors the spin-glass phase (before it disappears) over\nthe ferromagnetic phase and symmetrically the antiferromagnetic phase. When any\namount, including infinitesimal, frustration is introduced, the chaotic\nrescaling of local interactions occurs in the spin-glass phase. Chaos increases\nwith increasing frustration, as seen from the increased positive value of the\ncalculated Lyapunov exponent $\\lambda$, starting from $\\lambda =0$ when\nfrustration is absent. The calculated runaway exponent $y_R$ of the\nrenormalization-group flows decreases with increasing frustration to $y_R=0$\nwhen the spin-glass phase disappears. From our calculations of entropy and\nspecific heat curves in d=3, it is seen that frustration lowers in temperature\nthe onset of both long- and short-range order in spin-glass phases, but is more\neffective on the former. From calculations of the entropy as a function of\nantiferromagnetic bond concentration p, it is seen that the ground-state and\nlow-temperature entropy already mostly sets in within the ferromagnetic and\nantiferromagnetic phases, before the spin-glass phase is reached.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Dec 2013 16:16:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 2 Jun 2014 03:45:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-03"}

The standard cosmological model has\nmet the challenge of the high precision observations in cosmology and\nastroparticle physics. However these two standard models face both several\ntheoretical issues, such as the naturalness problem in the Higgs sector of the\nStandard Model, as well as observational issues, in particular the fact that an\nunknown kind of matter called Dark Matter accounts for the majority of the\nmatter content in our Universe. Attempts to solve such problems have led to the\ndevelopment of New Physics models during the last decades. Supersymmetry is one\nsuch model which addresses the fine-tuning problem in the Higgs sector and\nprovides viable Dark Matter candidates. Current high energy and high precision\nexperiments give many new opportunities to probe the supersymmetric models. It\nis in this context that this thesis is written. Considering the Minimal\nSupersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM), the simplest supersymmetric extension of\nthe Standard Model of particle physics, and its conventional Dark Matter\ncandidate, the neutralino, it is shown that collider constraints could provide\ninformations on the very early Universe at the inflation area. It is also\ndemonstrated that the Indirect Detection of Dark Matter, despite several\ndrawbacks, can be a powerful technique to probe supersymmetric Dark Matter\nmodels. Beyond the MSSM it is shown that unique characteristics of the Dark\nMatter candidate in the NMSSM could be probed at colliders. The study of a\nsupersymmetric model with an extended gauge symmetry, the UMSSM, is also\ndeveloped. The features of another Dark Matter candidate of this model, the\nRight-Handed sneutrino, are analysed. More general constraints such as those\ncoming from low energy observables are finally considered in this model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Dec 2013 18:13:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-03"}

In this paper, a\nvariational approach is used to derive a model for a piezoelectric beam that\nincludes magnetic effects. It is proven that the partial differential equation\nmodel is well-posed. Magnetic effects have a strong effect on the\nstabilizability of the control system. For almost all system parameters the\npiezoelectric beam can be strongly stabilized, but is not exponentially\nstabilizable in the energy space. Strong stabilization is achieved using only\nelectrical feedback. Furthermore, using the same electrical feedback, an\nexponentially stable closed-loop system can be obtained for a set of system\nparameters of zero Lebesgue measure. These results are compared to those of a\nbeam without magnetic effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Dec 2013 18:23:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-29"}

We consider networks where each node has\nexclusive access to a cost function, and design algorithms that make all nodes\ncooperate to find the minimum of the sum of all the cost functions. Several\nproblems in signal processing, control, and machine learning can be posed as\nsuch optimization problems. Given that communication is often the most\nenergy-consuming operation in networks, it is important to design\ncommunication-efficient algorithms. The main contributions of this thesis are a\nclassification scheme for distributed optimization and a set of corresponding\ncommunication-efficient algorithms.\n  The class of optimization problems we consider is quite general, since each\nfunction may depend on arbitrary components of the optimization variable, and\nnot necessarily on all of them. In doing so, we go beyond the common assumption\nin distributed optimization and create additional structure that can be used to\nreduce the number of communications. This structure is captured by our\nclassification scheme, which identifies easier instances of the problem, for\nexample the standard distributed optimization problem, where all functions\ndepend on all the components of the variable.\n  In our algorithms, no central node coordinates the network, all the\ncommunications occur between neighboring nodes, and the data associated with\neach node is processed locally. We show several applications including average\nconsensus, support vector machines, network flows, and several distributed\nscenarios for compressed sensing. We also propose a new framework for\ndistributed model predictive control. Through extensive numerical experiments,\nwe show that our algorithms outperform prior distributed algorithms in terms of\ncommunication-efficiency, even some that were specifically designed for a\nparticular application.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Dec 2013 19:19:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-03"}

Moreover, since PSRs do not require a\npredetermined latent state structure as an input, they offer an attractive\nframework for model-based reinforcement learning when agents must plan without\na priori access to a system model. Unfortunately, the expressiveness of PSRs\ncomes with significant computational cost, and this cost is a major factor\ninhibiting the use of PSRs in applications.

Two graphs H and H' are Ramsey-equivalent if every\ngraph G is Ramsey for H if and only if it is Ramsey for H'. In this paper, we\nstudy the problem of determining which graphs are Ramsey-equivalent to the\ncomplete graph K_k. A famous theorem of Nesetril and Rodl implies that any\ngraph H which is Ramsey-equivalent to K_k must contain K_k. We prove that the\nonly connected graph which is Ramsey-equivalent to K_k is itself. This gives a\nnegative answer to the question of Szabo, Zumstein, and Zurcher on whether K_k\nis Ramsey-equivalent to K_k.K_2, the graph on k+1 vertices consisting of K_k\nwith a pendent edge.\n  In fact, we prove a stronger result. A graph G is Ramsey minimal for a graph\nH if it is Ramsey for H but no proper subgraph of G is Ramsey for H. Let s(H)\nbe the smallest minimum degree over all Ramsey minimal graphs for H. The study\nof s(H) was introduced by Burr, Erdos, and Lovasz, where they show that\ns(K_k)=(k-1)^2.

The key intuition we follow\nis that the records of events that define the familiar objective past are\ninscribed in many distinct systems, e.g., subsystems of the environment, and\nare accessible locally in space and time to observers. We identify histories\nthat are not just consistent but redundantly consistent using the partial-trace\ncondition introduced by Finkelstein as a bridge between histories and\ndecoherence. The existence of redundant records is a sufficient condition for\nredundant consistency. It selects, from the multitude of the alternative sets\nof consistent histories, a small subset endowed with redundant records\ncharacteristic of the objective classical past. The information about an\nobjective history of the past is then simultaneously within reach of many, who\ncan independently reconstruct it and arrive at compatible conclusions in the\npresent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Dec 2013 05:02:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 Dec 2013 22:17:19 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 2 Dec 2015 19:48:02 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 14 Apr 2016 03:47:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-15"}

However, these methods have typically\nbeen evaluated using different population dynamics models and in the context of\nvery different concepts of stability, which makes it difficult to compare their\nrelative efficiencies. Moreover, since the dynamics of populations are\ndependent on the life-history of the species and its environment, it is\nconceivable that the stabilizing effects of control methods would also be\naffected by such factors, a complication that has typically not been\ninvestigated. In this study we compare six different control methods with\nrespect to their efficiency at inducing a common level of enhancement (50%\nincrease) for two kinds of stability (constancy and persistence) under four\ndifferent life history/ environment combinations. Since these methods have been\nanalytically studied elsewhere, we focus on an intuitive understanding of\nrealistic simulations incorporating noise, extinction probability and lattice\neffect. We show that for these six methods, even when the magnitude of\nstabilization attained is the same, other aspects of the dynamics like\npopulation size distribution can be very different. Consequently, correlated\naspects of stability, like the amount of persistence for a given degree of\nconstancy stability (and vice versa) or the corresponding effective population\nsize (a measure of resistance to genetic drift) vary widely among the methods.\nMoreover, the number of organisms needed to be added or removed to attain\nsimilar levels of stabilization also varies for these methods, a fact that has\neconomic implications. Finally, we compare the relative efficiency of these\nmethods through a composite index of various stability related measures. We\nfind that restocking to a constant lower threshold seems to be the optimal\nmethod under most conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Dec 2013 07:01:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-03"}

Unlike an\n$s$-wave superconductor which presents a robust single-particle gap across the\nSIT, the optical conductivity of a $d$-wave superconductor reveals a gapless\ninsulating phase, where the SIT can be detected by observing the disappearance\nof the Drude weight with the increasing disorder.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Dec 2013 08:10:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 Dec 2013 04:30:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-04"}

The type\n(i) cases are similar to the standard case in that the reduced phase space\ncomes equipped with globally smooth action and position variables, and turns\nout to be symplectomorphic to ${\\mathbb{C}P^{n-1}}$ as a Hamiltonian toric\nmanifold. In the type (ii) cases both the position variables and the action\nvariables develop singularities on a nowhere dense subset. A full\nclassification is derived for the parameter $y$ according to the type (i)\nversus type (ii) dichotomy. The simplest new type (i) systems, for which $\\pi/n\n< y < \\pi/(n-1)$, are described in some detail as an illustration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Dec 2013 10:27:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-01"}

Most of them assume a regular base-station\n(BS) antenna layout where the number of BS antennas is usually small. With the\ngrowing interest in cellular systems with large antenna arrays at BSs, it\nbecomes increasingly important for us to study how the BS antenna layout\naffects the rate performance when a massive number of BS antennas are employed.\n  This paper presents a comparative study of the asymptotic rate performance of\ndownlink multi-user systems with multiple BS antennas either co-located or\nuniformly distributed within a circular cell. Two representative linear\nprecoding schemes, maximum ratio transmission (MRT) and zero-forcing\nbeamforming (ZFBF), are considered, with which the effect of BS antenna layout\non the rate performance is characterized. The analysis shows that as the number\nof BS antennas $L$ and the number of users $K$ grow infinitely while\n$L/K{\\rightarrow}\\upsilon$, the asymptotic average user rates with the\nco-located antenna (CA) layout for both MRT and ZFBF are logarithmic functions\nof the ratio $\\upsilon$. With the distributed antenna (DA) layout, in contrast,\nthe scaling behavior of the average user rate closely depends on the precoding\nschemes. With ZFBF, for instance, the average user rate grows unboundedly as\n$L, K{\\rightarrow} \\infty$ and $L/K{\\rightarrow}\\upsilon{>}1$, which indicates\nthat substantial rate gains over the CA layout can be achieved when the number\nof BS antennas $L$ is large. The gain, nevertheless, becomes marginal when MRT\nis adopted.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Dec 2013 10:32:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-03"}

We apply\nthe method presented in this article to two systems of hyperbolic conservation\nlaws, namely the Euler equations of compressible gas dynamics and the equations\nof ideal classical magneto-hydrodynamics (MHD). Convergence studies up to\nfourth order of accuracy in space and time have been carried out. Several\nnumerical test problems have been solved to validate the new approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Dec 2013 12:41:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

We\nalso revisit the construction of its associated confidence intervals and show\nhow the Feldman-Cousins prescription efficiently solves the issue of classical\nintervals lying entirely in the unphysical negative domain. Such intervals can\nbe used to identify statistically significant polarized regions and conversely\nbuild masks for polarization data. We then consider the case of a general\n$[Q,U]$ covariance matrix and perform a generalization of the estimator that\npreserves its asymptotic properties. We show that its bias does not depend on\nthe true polarization angle, and provide an analytic estimate of its variance.\nThe estimator value, together with its variance, provide a powerful\npoint-estimate of the true polarization amplitude that follows an unbiased\nGaussian distribution for a SNR as low as 2.

While the surface\nmagnetic field of a typical NS in a LMXB is lower by more than four orders of\nmagnitude than the much more intense fields of neutron stars accompanying\nhigh-mass binaries, the radius at which the matter in-flow is truncated in a\nNS-LMXB system is much lower. The magnetic field at the magnetospheric\ninterface is then orders of magnitude larger at this interface, and as\nconsequence, so is the power to accelerate electrons.

Therefore, it is crucial to understand how solar FRs evolve\nin the heliosphere to improve our space weather forecasting tools. We analyze\n15 coronal mass ejections (CMEs), with clear FR signatures, observed during the\ndecay of Solar Cycle 23 and rise of Solar Cycle 24. We estimate initial\norientations of the FRs at the origin using extreme ultraviolet observations of\npost-eruption arcades and/or eruptive prominences. Then we reconstruct\nmultiviewpoint coronagraph observations of the CMEs from ~2 to 30 Rs with a\nthree-dimensional geometric representation of a FR to determine their\ngeometrical parameters. Finally, we propagate the FRs from ~30 Rs to 1 AU\nthrough MHD-simulated background solar wind while using in-situ measurements at\n1 AU of the associated magnetic cloud as a constraint for the propagation\ntechnique. These methodology allows us to estimate the FR orientation all the\nway from the Sun to 1 AU. We find that while the FRs deflection occurs\npredominantly below 30 Rs, a significant amount of deflection and rotation\nhappens between 30 Rs and 1 AU. We compare the FR orientation to the local\norientation of the heliospheric current sheet (HCS). We find that slow FRs tend\nto align with the streams of slow solar wind in the inner heliosphere. During\nthe solar cycle minimum the slow solar wind channel as well as the HCS usually\noccupy the area in the vicinity of the solar equatorial plane, which in the\npast led researchers to the hypothesis that FRs align with the HCS. Our results\nshow that exclusions from this rule are explained by interaction with the\nParker-spiralled background magnetic field, which dominates over the magnetic\ninteraction with the HCS in the inner heliosphere at least during solar minimum\nconditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Dec 2013 13:55:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Jan 2014 11:08:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-27"}

For SNRs that\nhave similar mor- phology in infrared and X-rays, the ratios of 24 to 70 {\\mu}m\nfluxes have good correlation with the electron density of hot plasma.

In order to direct\nevacuees in an intuitive manner whilst implementing the routing algorithm's\nscheme, we use dynamic exit signs, i.e. whose pointing direction can be\ncontrolled. To make this system practical and minimise reliance on sensors\nduring the evacuation, we use an evacuee mobility model and make several\nassumptions on the characteristics of the evacuee flow. We validate this\nconcept using simulations, and show how the underpinning assumptions may limit\nthe system's performance, especially in low-headcount evacuations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Dec 2013 15:26:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-03"}
