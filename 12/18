The optimal strategy for resolving a weak\nstochastic signal force on a huge background (typically given by thermal noise)\nis a crucial and debated topic, and the stability of the mechanical resonance\nis a further, related critical issue. We introduce and analyze the parametric\ncontrol of the optical spring, that allows to stabilize the resonance and\nprovides a phase reference for the oscillator motion, yet conserving a free\nevolution in one quadrature of the phase space. We also study quantitatively\nthe characteristics of our micro opto-mechanical system as detector of\nstochastic force for short measurement times (for quick, high resolution\nmonitoring) as well as for the longer term observations that optimize the\nsensitivity. We compare a simple, naive strategy based on the evaluation of the\nvariance of the displacement (that is a widely used technique) with an optimal\nWiener-Kolmogorov data analysis. We show that, thanks to the parametric\nstabilization of the effective susceptibility, we can more efficiently\nimplement Wiener filtering, and we investigate how this strategy improves the\nperformance of our system.

The power level of turbulence, roughly\ndefined as the power in the transverse field fluctuations normalized to the\nmedium-scale average background field, tightly orders the location of the peaks\nin the probability distribution functions (PDFs) of the angles between local\nfields and Parker spiral. As a result, the broad variations in the power level\nof turbulence cause a steep dependence of the average power level of turbulence\non the angle of the local field to the Parker spiral, with the highest\nturbulence levels found near the normal to the Parker spiral and the lowest\nlevels near the Parker spiral direction. Generalized quasilinear estimates of\nthe mean cross-field displacements adapted to intermittent time-varying\nturbulence lead to accurate fits of the observed angle PDFs at all stable\nlevels of turbulence, supporting the idea that isotropic turbulence could\naccount for the observed angle PDFs. Modeling of the angles alpha_r between\nlocal fields and radial direction, from the PDFs of the angles alpha between\nlocal and background fields under an assumption of axisymmetry of the turbulent\nfields around a background field in or near the direction of the Parker spiral,\nalso produces fairly good fits of the observed PDFs of alpha_r, thereby\nvalidating the assumption.

The challenge is two-fold.\nAt the atomic scale, where the coupling is relatively large, the magnetic\ninteraction is often overshadowed by the much larger coulomb exchange\ncounterpart. In typical situations where exchange is negligible, magnetic\ninteractions are also very weak and well below ambient magnetic noise. Here we\nreport on the first measurement of the magnetic interaction between two\nelectronic spins. To this end, we used the ground state valence electrons of\ntwo $^{88}$Sr$^+$ ions, co-trapped in an electric Paul trap and separated by\nmore than two micrometers. We measured the weak, millihertz scale\n(alternatively $10^{-18}$ eV or $10^{-14}$ K), magnetic interaction between\ntheir electronic spins. This, in the presence of magnetic noise that was six\norders of magnitude larger than the respective magnetic fields the electrons\napply on each other. Cooperative spin dynamics was kept coherent for 15 s\nduring which spin-entanglement was generated. The sensitivity necessary for\nthis measurement was provided by restricting the spin evolution to a\nDecoherence-Free Subspace (DFS) which is immune to collective magnetic field\nnoise. Finally, by varying the separation between the two ions, we were able to\nrecover the inverse cubic distance dependence of the interaction. The reported\nmethod suggests an alternative route to the search of long-range anomalous\nspin-spin forces and can be generalized to include Quantum Error Correction\ncodes for other cases of extremely weak signal detection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Dec 2013 17:56:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-02"}

The measured mass value,\nhaving already reached the level of a precision observable with an experimental\naccuracy of about 500 MeV, plays an important role in this context. In the MSSM\nthe mass of the light CP-even Higgs boson, M_h, can directly be predicted from\nthe other parameters of the model. The accuracy of this prediction should at\nleast match the one of the experimental result. The relatively high mass value\nof about 126 GeV has led to many investigations where the scalar top quarks are\nin the multi-TeV range. We improve the prediction for M_h in the MSSM by\ncombining the existing fixed-order result, comprising the full one-loop and\nleading and subleading two-loop corrections, with a resummation of the leading\nand subleading logarithmic contributions from the scalar top sector to all\norders. In this way for the first time a high-precision prediction for the mass\nof the light CP-even Higgs boson in the MSSM is possible all the way up to the\nmulti-TeV region of the relevant supersymmetric particles. The results are\nincluded in the code FeynHiggs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Dec 2013 20:53:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-23"}

In this work, I\ninvestigate protostellar collapse in solar-metallicity and low-metallicity ($Z\n= 0.1 Z_\\odot$) environments using 3D radiation hydrodynamic and\nmagnetohydrodynamic simulations. Because radiation cooling is more effective in\nthe low-metallicity environments, first cores are colder and have lower\nentropies. As a result, first cores are smaller, less massive and have shorter\nlifetimes in the low-metallicity clouds. Therefore, first cores would be less\nlikely to be found in low-metallicity star forming clouds. This also implies\nthat first cores tend to be more gravitationally unstable and susceptible to\nfragmentation. The evolution and structure of protostellar cores formed after\nthe second collapse weakly depend on metallicities in the spherical and\nmagnetized models despite the large difference in the metallicities. Because\nthis is due to the change of the heat capacity by dissociation and ionization\nof hydrogen, it is a general consequence of the second collapse as long as the\neffects of radiation cooling are not very large during the second collapse. On\nthe other hand, the effects of different metallicities are more significant in\nthe rotating models without magnetic fields, because they evolve slower than\nother models and therefore more affected by radiation cooling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Dec 2013 21:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

The growth of over densities is very well described by perturbation\ntheory at that epoch and the signal can in principle be predicted to arbitrary\naccuracy for given cosmological parameters. Recently, Tseliakhovich and Hirata\npointed out a previously neglected and important physical effect, due to the\nfact that baryons and cold dark matter (CDM) have supersonic relative\nvelocities after recombination. This relative velocity suppresses the growth of\nmatter fluctuations on scales $k \\sim 10-10^3$ Mpc$^{-1}$. In addition, the\namplitude of the small-scale power spectrum is modulated on the large scales\nover which the relative velocity varies, corresponding to $k \\sim 0.005-1$\nMpc$^{-1}$. In this paper, the effect of the relative velocity on 21 cm\nbrightness temperature fluctuations from redshifts $z \\geq 30$ is computed. We\nshow that the 21 cm power spectrum is affected on ${\\it most}$ scales. On small\nscales, the signal is typically suppressed several tens of percent, except for\nextremely small scales ($k \\gtrsim 2000$ Mpc$^{-1}$) for which the fluctuations\nare boosted by resonant excitation of acoustic waves. On large scales, 21 cm\nfluctuations are enhanced due to the non-linear dependence of the brightness\ntemperature on the underlying gas density and temperature. The enhancement of\nthe 21 cm power spectrum is of a few percent at $k \\sim 0.1$ Mpc$^{-1}$ and up\nto tens of percent at $k \\lesssim 0.005$ Mpc$^{-1}$, for standard $\\Lambda$CDM\ncosmology. In principle this effect allows to probe the small-scale matter\npower spectrum not only through a measurement of small angular scales but also\nthrough its effect on large angular scales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Dec 2013 21:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-23"}

Finally, we estimate the expected number of flares\nfor a given source for our limiting flux and provide the recipe for calculating\nthem for the limiting flux of future hard X-ray observatories.

Some instances (such as outliers) are detrimental to inferring a\nmodel of the data. Several machine learning techniques treat instances in a\ndata set differently during training such as curriculum learning, filtering,\nand boosting. However, an automated method for determining how beneficial an\ninstance is for inferring a model of the data does not exist. In this paper, we\npresent an automated method that orders the instances in a data set by\ncomplexity based on the their likelihood of being misclassified (instance\nhardness). The underlying assumption of this method is that instances with a\nhigh likelihood of being misclassified represent more complex concepts in a\ndata set. Ordering the instances in a data set allows a learning algorithm to\nfocus on the most beneficial instances and ignore the detrimental ones. We\ncompare ordering the instances in a data set in curriculum learning, filtering\nand boosting. We find that ordering the instances significantly increases\nclassification accuracy and that filtering has the largest impact on\nclassification accuracy.

The evolution and dynamics of the two sets are\nquite different. The first set of loops exhibits blueshifts for about 25\nminutes followed by redshifts, while the second set shows stronger blueshifts,\nwhich are maintained for about one hour. The UV 1600 observation by AIA also\nshows that the feet of the second set of loops brighten twice. These suggest\nthat continuous heating may be present in the second set of loops.

Therefore, we propose to include software processes more\nexplicitly into the SE curricula. We designed and implemented a course at\nMaster's level in which students learn why software processes are necessary,\nand how they can be analyzed, designed, implemented, and continuously improved.\nIn this paper, we present our course's structure, its goals, and corresponding\nteaching methods. We evaluate the course and further discuss our experiences so\nthat lecturers and researchers can directly use our lessons learned in their\nown curricula.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Dec 2013 08:43:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-19"}

We have measured specific heat of above mixed\nsalts at low temperatures (1.5 K $< T <$ 15 K). It is seen that while the\nspecific heat of pure salts obeys Debye law, the specific heat of mixed salts\ndoes not obey Debye law. We have studied the effect of the NH$_{4}^{+}$ ion\nconcentration, first neighbor environment of NH$_{4}^{+}$ ion and the lattice\nstrain field on the non-Debye specific heat by carrying out measurements on\nsuitably chosen mixed salts.

A prominent example is non-locality. Non-local\ncorrelations cannot be explained, in classical terms, by shared information but\nonly by communication. On the other hand, the phenomenon does not allow for\n(potentially faster-than-light) message transmission. The fact that some\nnon-local and non-signaling correlations are predicted by quantum theory,\nwhereas others fail to be, asks for a criterion, as simple as possible, that\ncharacterizes which joint input-output behaviors are ``quantum'' and which are\nnot. In the context of the derivation of such criteria, it is of central\nimportance to understand when non-local correlations can be amplified by a\nnon-interactive protocol, i.e., whether some types of weak non-locality can be\ndistilled into stronger by local operations. Since it has been recognized that\nthe searched-for criteria must inherently be multi-partite, the question of\ndistillation, extensively studied and understood two-party scenarios, should be\nadressed in the multi-user setting, where much less is known. Considering the\nspace of intrinsically n-partite correlations, we show the possibility of\ndistilling weak non-local boxes to the algebraically maximal ones without any\ncommunication. Our protocols improve on previously known methods which still\nrequired partial communication. The price we have to pay for dropping the need\nfor communication entirely is the assumption of permutation invariance: Any\ncorrelation that can be realized between some set of players is possible\nbetween any such set. This assumption is very natural since the laws of physics\nare invariant under spacial translation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Dec 2013 09:28:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-26"}

Existing\nseismology schemes based on approximations to the period and damping time of\nkink oscillations are often used beyond their theoretical range of\napplicability. These approximations assume that the variation of density across\nthe loop is confined to a nonuniform layer much thinner than the radius of the\nloop, but the results of the inversion problem often do not satisfy this\npreliminary hypothesis. Here, we determine the accuracy of the analytic\napproximations to the period and damping time, and its impact on seismology\nestimates, when largely nonuniform loops are considered. We find that the\naccuracy of the approximations when used beyond their range of applicability is\nstrongly affected by the form of the density profile across the loop, that is\nobservationally unknown and so must be arbitrarily imposed as part of the\ntheoretical model. The error associated with the analytic approximations can be\nlarger than 50% even for relatively thin nonuniform layers. This error directly\naffects the accuracy of approximate seismology estimates compared to actual\nnumerical inversions. In addition, assuming different density profiles can\nproduce noncoincident intervals of the seismic variables in inversions of the\nsame event. The ignorance about the true shape of density variation across the\nloop is an important source of error that may dispute the reliability of\nparameters seismically inferred assuming an ad hoc density profile.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Dec 2013 09:58:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

We use a\nsemi-analytic hierarchical model of galaxy evolution to build the theoretical\nTF relation. With this tool, we analyse a unique dataset of galaxies for which\nwe cross-match luminosity with total circular velocity and central velocity\ndispersion. We provide a theoretical framework to calculate such measurable\nquantities from semi-analytic models. We establish the morphology dependence of\nthe TF relation in both model and data. We analyse the dynamical properties of\nthe model galaxies and determine that the parameter 'sigma/Vc', i.e. the ratio\nbetween random and total motions defined by velocity dispersion and circular\nvelocity, accurately characterises the varying slope of the TF relation for\ndifferent model galaxy types. We apply these dynamical cuts to the observed\ngalaxies and find that such selection produces a differential slope of the TF\nrelation. The TF slope in different ranges of 'sigma/Vc' is consistent with\nthat for the photometric classification in Sa, Sb, Sc. We conclude that\n'sigma/Vc' is a good parameter to classify galaxy type, and we argue that such\nclassification based on dynamics more closely mirrors the physical properties\nof the observed galaxies, compared to visual classification. We also argue that\ndynamical classification is useful for samples where eye inspection is not\nreliable or impractical. We conclude that 'sigma/Vc' is a suitable parameter to\ncharacterise the hierarchical assembly history that determines the\ndisk-to-bulge ratio, and to expand the TF relation into a three-dimensional\nmanifold, defined by luminosity, circular velocity and 'sigma/Vc'.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Dec 2013 10:15:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

When gravity is modified, this is typically\naccompanied by the introduction of an additional scalar degree of freedom,\nwhich mediates an attractive fifth force. The presence of an extra\ngravitational coupling, however, is tightly constrained by local measurements.\nIn chameleon modifications of gravity, local tests can be evaded by employing a\nscreening mechanism that suppresses the fifth force in dense environments.\nWhile the chameleon field may be screened in the interior of the cluster, its\nouter region can still be affected by the extra force, introducing a deviation\nbetween the hydrostatic and lensing mass of the cluster. Thus, the chameleon\nmodification can be tested by combining the gas and lensing measurements of the\ncluster.

My technique utilises a Cellular Automaton (CA) to build a\nrepresentation of the environment at each time step of the game. The basis of\nthe representation is a 2-D grid of cells.

Only in a handful of cases has it\nbeen possible obtain simultaneous coverage of the prompt emission in a\nmulti-wavelength regime (gamma-ray to optical), as a result of: observing the\nfield by chance prior to the GRB (e.g. 080319B/naked-eye burst), long-prompt\nemission (e.g., 080928, 110205A) or triggered on a pre-cursor (e.g., 041219A,\n050820A, 061121). This small selection of bursts have shown both correlated and\nuncorrelated gamma-ray and optical light curve behaviour, and the\nmulti-wavelength emission mechanism remains far from resolved (i.e. single\npopulation synchrotron self-Component, electron distributions, additional\nneutron components or residual collisions). Such multi-wavelength observations\nduring the GRB prompt phase are pivotal in providing further insight on the\npoorly understood prompt emission mechanism. We add to this small sample the\nSwift burst 121217A that had two distinct periods of prompt emission separated\nby ~700 s, observed by Swift/BAT, Swift/XRT and Fermi/GBM. As a result of the\ntime delay of the second emission, it enabled optical imaging (from 3 to 7\nbands) to be taken with the GROND instrument to a resolution as fine as 10s.\nThis multi-wavelength data will hopefully allow us to shed more light on the\ncurrent picture of prompt emission physics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Dec 2013 11:37:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-19"}

Despite its\ntheoretical appeal, the practical relevance of correlation clustering still\nremains largely unexplored, mainly due to the fact that correlation clustering\nrequires the $\\Theta(n^2)$ pairwise similarities as input.\n  In this paper we initiate the investigation into \\emph{local} algorithms for\ncorrelation clustering. In \\emph{local correlation clustering} we are given the\nidentifier of a single object and we want to return the cluster to which it\nbelongs in some globally consistent near-optimal clustering, using a small\nnumber of similarity queries. Local algorithms for correlation clustering open\nthe door to \\emph{sublinear-time} algorithms, which are particularly useful\nwhen the similarity between items is costly to compute, as it is often the case\nin many practical application domains. They also imply $(i)$ distributed and\nstreaming clustering algorithms, $(ii)$ constant-time estimators and testers\nfor cluster edit distance, and $(iii)$ property-preserving parallel\nreconstruction algorithms for clusterability.\n  Specifically, we devise a local clustering algorithm attaining a $(3,\n\\varepsilon)$-approximation in time $O(1/\\varepsilon^2)$ independently of the\ndataset size. An explicit approximate clustering for all objects can be\nproduced in time $O(n/\\varepsilon)$ (which is provably optimal). We also\nprovide a fully additive $(1,\\varepsilon)$-approximation with local query\ncomplexity $poly(1/\\varepsilon)$ and time complexity $2^{poly(1/\\varepsilon)}$.\nThe latter yields the fastest polynomial-time approximation scheme for\ncorrelation clustering known to date.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Dec 2013 12:04:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-19"}

In this way, one can tell how much the kinetic\nor dynamic mechanism contributes to the index of the relationship. Our analysis\ngives rise to several conclusions. (1) The index of the kinetic effect in the\n$L_p - E_p$ relation can simply be derived from the theory of special\nrelativity, which is generally larger than 2, depending on the situation\nconcerned. (2) The index of the dynamic effect in the relation can be deduced\nfrom observation once a model of jets is adopted. According to current GRB\ndata, we find: the dynamic effect alone tends to make an anti-correlation\nbetween $L_p$ and $E_p$; in terms of statistics, the dynamic effect is\nobviously smaller than the kinetic effect; in the situation of jets with moving\ndiscrete radio clouds which moves directly towards the observer, the index of\nthe dynamic effect is currently constrained within $(-1.6, -1)$, while in other\nsituations of jets, the constrains are different; both internal and external\nshocks can account for the current data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Dec 2013 12:30:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-19"}

In contrast with\npreviously reported systems, the disk is significantly eccentric, and the\nsystem is Gyr-old. We aim to investigate the long-term evolution of eccentric\nstructures in debris disks caused by a perturber on an eccentric orbit. Both\nanalytical predictions and numerical N-body simulations are used to investigate\nthe observable structures that could be produced by eccentric perturbers. The\nlong-term evolution of the disk geometry is examined, with particular\napplication to the $\\zeta^2$ Ret system.

For the case of $\\zeta^2$ Ret, we\nplace limits on the mass and orbit of the companion required to produce the\nobservations. Synthetic images show that the pattern observed around $\\zeta^2$\nRet can be produced by an eccentric disk seen close to edge-on, and allow us to\nbring additional constraints on the disk parameters of our model (disk flux,\nextent). We determine that eccentric planets or stellar companions can induce\nlong-lived eccentric structures in debris disks. Observations of such eccentric\nstructures provide potential evidence of the presence of such a companion in a\nplanetary system.

We then consistently\ncombine correlation functions to extend the recent analysis by Giannantonio et\nal. (2013), where the density-density and the density-CMB temperature\ncorrelations were used. Due to the intrinsic noise of the Planck lensing map,\nwhich affects the largest scales most severely, we find that the constraints on\nthe galaxy bias are similar to the constraints from density-CMB temperature\ncorrelations.

However, the\nchemical compositions derived from observations are not fully understood, as\nfor instance in the case of the CH4/CO abundance ratio, which is often inferred\ndifferent from what has been predicted by chemical models. Recently, the warm\nNeptune GJ3470b has been discovered and because of its close distance from us\nand high transit depth, it is a very promising candidate for follow up\ncharacterisation of its atmosphere. We study the atmospheric composition of\nGJ3470b in order to compare with the current observations of this planet, to\nprepare the future ones, but also as a typical case study to understand the\nchemical composition of warm (sub-)Neptunes. The metallicity of such\natmospheres is totally uncertain, and vary probably to values up to 100x solar.\nWe explore the space of unknown parameters to predict the range of possible\natmospheric compositions. Within the parameter space explored we find that in\nmost cases methane is the major carbon-bearing species. We however find that in\nsome cases, typically for high metallicities with a sufficiently high\ntemperature the CH4/CO abundance ratio can become lower than unity, as\nsuggested by some multiwavelength photometric observations of other warm\n(sub-)Neptunes, such as GJ1214b and GJ436b. As for the emission spectrum of\nGJ3470b, brightness temperatures at infrared wavelengths may vary between 400\nand 800K depending on the thermal profile and metallicity. Combined with a hot\ntemperature profile, a substantial enrichment in heavy elements by a factor of\n100 with respect to the solar composition can shift the carbon balance in\nfavour of carbon monoxide at the expense of CH4. Nevertheless, current\nobservations of this planet do not allow yet to determine which model is more\naccurate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Dec 2013 14:58:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

For weak inter-channel coupling, the AB\noscillations in the current which is reflected from the device are very small,\nand therefore the oscillations in the two outgoing currents must cancel each\nother, yielding the anti-phase behavior, independent of the length of the\ncoupling regime. For strong inter-channel coupling, whose range depends on the\nasymmetry between the channels, and for a relatively long coupling distance,\nall except two of the waves in the coupled channels become evanescent. For the\nremaining running waves one has a very weak dependence of the ratio between the\ncurrents in the two channels on the magnetic flux, implying that these currents\nare in phase with each other.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Dec 2013 15:30:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

We see no evidence for\nshocks, or established isobaric gas motions (sloshing), but there is much\nsub-structure associated with a dynamically active central region that\nencompasses the brightest radio emission. Gas heating is evident in directions\nperpendicular to the inferred line of encounter between the infalling group and\ncluster. The radio-emitting tendrils run along boundaries between gas of\ndifferent temperature, apparently lubricating the gas flows and inhibiting heat\ntransfer. The first stages of the encounter may have helped trigger the radio\ngalaxies into their current phase of activity, where we see X-rays from the\nnuclei, jets, and hotspots.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Dec 2013 22:59:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

The evolution of any\nbroadly applied model is accompanied by multiple generalizations that aim to\nresolve conceptual difficulties and to explain the ever-growing pool of\nobservational data. In the case of Standard Cosmological Model one of the most\npromising directions of generalization is replacement of the cosmological\nconstant with a more complicated, dynamic, form of dark energy and\nincorporation of interaction between the dark components---dark energy (DE) and\ndark matter (DM). Typically, DE models are based on scalar fields minimally\ncoupled to gravity, and do not implement explicit coupling of the field to the\nbackground DM. However, there is no fundamental reason for this assumption in\nthe absence of an underlying symmetry which would suppress the coupling. Given\nthat we do not know the true nature of either DE or DM, we cannot exclude the\npossibility that there is some kind of coupling between them. Whereas\ninteractions between DE and normal matter particles are heavily constrained by\nobservations (e.g. in the solar system and gravitational experiments on Earth),\nthis is not the case for DM particles. In other words, it is possible for the\ndark components to interact with each other while not being coupled to standard\nmodel particles. Therefore, the possibility of DE-DM interaction should be\ninvestigated with utmost gravity.\n  This version contains only formulations of 117 problems. The full collection,\nwith solutions included, is available in the form of a wiki-based resource at\nuniverseinproblems.com.
