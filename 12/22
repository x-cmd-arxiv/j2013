Assuming a\nquasiparticle picture for the grand canonical gluon ensemble the thermal\nequilibrium state is found by minimizing the free energy with respect to the\nquasi-gluon energy. The deconfinement phase transition is accompanied by a\ndrastic change of the infrared exponents of the ghost and gluon propagators.\nAbove the phase transition the ghost form factor remains infrared divergent but\nits infrared exponent is approximately halved. The gluon energy being infrared\ndivergent in the confined phase becomes infrared finite in the deconfined\nphase. Furthermore, the effective potential of the order parameter for\nconfinement is calculated for SU$(N)$ Yang-Mills theory in the Hamiltonian\napproach by compactifying one spatial dimension and using a background gauge\nfixing. In the simplest truncation, neglecting the ghost and using the\nultraviolet form of the gluon energy, we recover the Weiss potential. From the\nfull non-perturbative potential (with the ghost included) we extract a critical\ntemperature of the deconfinement phase transition of $269$ MeV for the gauge\ngroup SU$(2)$ and $283$ MeV for SU$(3)$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Dec 2013 16:21:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

Spectral methods propose elegant solutions to the problem of\ninferring weighted automata from finite samples of variable-length strings\ndrawn from an unknown target distribution. These methods rely on a singular\nvalue decomposition of a matrix $H_S$, called the Hankel matrix, that records\nthe frequencies of (some of) the observed strings. The accuracy of the learned\ndistribution depends both on the quantity of information embedded in $H_S$ and\non the distance between $H_S$ and its mean $H_r$.

These results suggest that the inclination and rotation of the two\ncomponents are rather different. The primary is a slow rotator with ~6 d\nperiod, seen at ~60 deg inclination, while the secondary rotates fast with ~1.2\nd period, and is seen at ~20 inclination. Spectropolarimetric measurements\nrevealed that the secondary component has a magnetic field with at least a few\nhundred Gauss strength, while no magnetic field can be detected in the primary.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Dec 2013 21:36:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

However, the usual interacting dark energy models (with\nconstant $w$) suffer from some catastrophic difficulties. For example, the\n$Q\\propto\\rho_{\\rm c}$ model leads to an early-time large-scale instability,\nand the $Q\\propto\\rho_{\\rm de}$ model gives rise to the future unphysical\nresult for cold dark matter density (in the case of a positive coupling). In\norder to overcome these fatal flaws, we propose in this paper an interacting\ndark energy model (with constant $w$) in which the interaction term is\ncarefully designed to realize that $Q\\propto\\rho_{\\rm de}$ at the early times\nand $Q\\propto\\rho_{\\rm c}$ in the future, simultaneously solving the early-time\nsuperhorizon instability and future unphysical $\\rho_{\\rm c}$ problems. The\nconcrete form of the interaction term in this model is $Q=3\\beta H\n\\frac{\\rho_{\\rm{de}}\\rho_{\\rm{c}}}{\\rho_{\\rm{de}}+\\rho_{\\rm{c}}}$, where\n$\\beta$ is the dimensionless coupling constant. We show that this model is\nactually equivalent to the decomposed new generalized Chaplygin gas (NGCG)\nmodel, with the relation $\\beta=-\\alpha w$. We calculate the cosmological\nperturbations in this model in a gauge-invariant way and show that the\ncosmological perturbations are stable during the whole expansion history\nprovided that $\\beta>0$. Furthermore, we use the Planck data in conjunction\nwith other astrophysical data to place stringent constraints on this model\n(with eight parameters), and we find that indeed $\\beta>0$ is supported by the\njoint constraint at more than 1$\\sigma$ level. The excellent theoretical\nfeatures and the support from observations all indicate that the decomposed\nNGCG model deserves more attention and further investigation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Dec 2013 01:58:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Apr 2014 00:06:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 20 Apr 2014 13:52:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-28"}

We compute an approximate\np-value by counting how many times the null hypothesis holds in bootstrap\nreplicates. This frequency, known as bootstrap probability, is widely used in\nevolutionary biology, but often reported as biased in the literature. Based on\nthe asymptotic theory of bootstrap confidence intervals, there have been some\nnew attempts for adjusting the bias via bootstrap probability without direct\naccess to the parameter value. One such an attempt is the double bootstrap\nwhich adjusts the bias by bootstrapping the bootstrap probability. Another new\nattempt is the multiscale bootstrap which is similar to the m-out-of-n\nbootstrap but very unusually extrapolating the bootstrap probability to $m=-n$.\nIn this paper, we employ these two attempts at the same time, and call the new\nprocedure as multiscale-double bootstrap. By focusing on the multivariate\nnormal model, we investigate higher-order asymptotics up to fourth-order\naccuracy. Geometry of the region plays important roles in the asymptotic\ntheory. It was known in the literature that the curvature of the boundary\nsurface of the region determines the bias of bootstrap probability. We found\nout that the curvature-of-curvature determines the remaining bias of double\nbootstrap. The multiscale bootstrap removes these biases. The multiscale-double\nbootstrap is fourth order accurate with coverage probability erring only\n$O(n^{-2})$, and it is robust against computational error of parameter\nestimation used for generating bootstrap replicates from the null distribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Dec 2013 07:01:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 May 2014 13:18:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-21"}

The\nmajor trend of malignant transformation can be described as a two-phase\nprocess, where an initial increase of network plasticity is followed by a\ndecrease of plasticity at late stages of tumor development. The fluctuating\nintensity of stress factors, like hypoxia, inflammation and the either\ncooperative or hostile interactions of tumor inter-cellular networks, all\nincrease the adaptation potential of cancer cells. This may lead to the bypass\nof cellular senescence, and to the development of cancer stem cells.

Actual properties of cancer stem cells\ndepend on the individual \"stress-history\" of the given tumor. Cancer stem cells\nare characterized by an extremely large evolvability (i.e. a capacity to\ngenerate heritable phenotypic variation), which corresponds well with the\ndefining hallmarks of cancer stem cells: the possession of the capacity to\nself-renew and to repeatedly re-build the heterogeneous lineages of cancer\ncells that comprise a tumor in new environments. Cancer stem cells represent a\ncell population, which is adapted to adapt. We argue that the high evolvability\nof cancer stem cells is helped by their repeated transitions between plastic\n(proliferative, symmetrically dividing) and rigid (quiescent, asymmetrically\ndividing, often more invasive) phenotypes having plastic and rigid networks.\nThus, cancer stem cells reverse and replay cancer development multiple times.\nWe describe network models potentially explaining cancer stem cell-like\nbehavior.

It envisages the possibility that a fraction of\nlow- and very low-mass cluster stars may accrete the ejecta of interacting\nmassive binary (and possibly also fast rotating massive) stars during the fully\nconvective, pre-main sequence stage, to reproduce the CN and ONa\nanticorrelations observed among stars in individual clusters. This scenario is\nassumed to be able to explain the presence (and properties) of the multiple\npopulations in the majority of globular clusters in the Milky Way. Here we have\nconsidered the well studied cluster NGC 2808, which displays a triple main\nsequence with well defined and separate He abundances. Knowledge of these\nabundances allowed us to put strong constraints on the He mass fraction and\namount of matter to be accreted by low-mass pre-main sequence stars. We find\nthat the minimum He mass fraction in the accreted gas has to be $\\sim0.44$ to\nproduce the observed sequences and that at fixed initial mass of the accreting\nstar, different efficiencies for the accretion are required to produce stars\nplaced onto the multiple main sequences. This may be explained by differences\nin the orbital properties of the progenitors and/or different spatial\ndistribution of intracluster gas with varying He abundances. Both O-Na and C-N\nanticorrelations appear naturally along the main sequences, once considering\nthe predicted relationship between He and CNONa abundances in the ejecta of the\npolluters. As a consequence of the accretion, we predict no discontinuity\nbetween the abundance ranges covered by intermediate and blue main sequence\nstars, but we find a sizeable (several 0.1 dex) discontinuity of the N and Na\nabundances between objects on the intermediate and red main sequences.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Dec 2013 11:01:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-05"}

Here we\ncompare this interpretation with WSO (Wilcox Solar Observatory) photospheric\nmagnetic field data in order to determine the amplitude of magnetic\nfluctuations required to explain the phenomenon and to compare the results with\npredictions from a simple dynamo model which takes these fluctuations into\naccount.

The reversal epoch, during which the fluctuating contribution to the\ndipole is larger than that from the mean field, is about 4 months. The memory\ntime of the fluctuations is about 2 months. Observations demonstrate that the\nrms of the magnetic fluctuations is strongly modulated by the phase of the\nsolar cycle. This gives additional support to the concept that the solar\nmagnetic field is generated by a single dynamo mechanism rather than also by\nindependent small-scale dynamo action. A suggestion of a weak nonaxsymmetric\nmagnetic field of a fluctuating nature arises from the analysis, with a\nlifetime of about 1 year.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Dec 2013 13:04:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 5 Jul 2014 01:40:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-05"}

Our Herschel Open Time Key Programme DUNES aims at detecting and\ncharacterizing debris disks around nearby, sun-like stars. In addition to the\nstatistical analysis of the data, the detailed study of single objects through\nspatially resolving the disk and detailed modeling of the data is a main goal\nof the project.\n  Methods. We obtained the first observations spatially resolving the debris\ndisk around the sun-like star HIP 17439 (HD23484) using the instruments PACS\nand SPIRE on board the Herschel Space Observatory. Simultaneous\nmulti-wavelength modeling of these data together with ancillary data from the\nliterature is presented.\n  Results. A standard single component disk model fails to reproduce the major\naxis radial profiles at 70 um, 100 um, and 160 um simultaneously. Moreover, the\nbest-fit parameters derived from such a model suggest a very broad disk\nextending from few au up to few hundreds of au from the star with a nearly\nconstant surface density which seems physically unlikely. However, the\nconstraints from both the data and our limited theoretical investigation are\nnot strong enough to completely rule out this model. An alternative, more\nplausible, and better fitting model of the system consists of two rings of dust\nat approx. 30 au and 90 au, respectively, while the constraints on the\nparameters of this model are weak due to its complexity and intrinsic\ndegeneracies.\n  Conclusions. The disk is probably composed of at least two components with\ndifferent spatial locations (but not necessarily detached), while a single,\nbroad disk is possible, but less likely. The two spatially well-separated rings\nof dust in our best-fit model suggest the presence of at least one high mass\nplanet or several low-mass planets clearing the region between the two rings\nfrom planetesimals and dust.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Dec 2013 14:08:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

It is worth mentioning that here only a few number of\niterations are required to reach the closed form solutions as series expansions\nof some known functions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Dec 2013 09:07:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-30"}

In this assignment, we generalize\nthe analysis to the framework of nonextremal Reissner-Nordstr\\\"{o}m BHs (RNBH).\nSuch a generalization is important because in both SBHs and KBHs an absorbed\n(or emitted) particle has only mass. Instead, in RNBHs the particle has charge\nas well as mass. In doing so, we expose that for the RNBH, QNMs can be\nnaturally interpreted in terms of quantum levels for both particle emission and\nabsorption.
