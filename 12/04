In\nlarge computational systems with a finite interaction-codes, the appearance of\nconflicting goals is inevitable. Simple conflicting forces can lead to quite\ncomplex structures and behaviors, leading to the concept of \"frustration\" in\ncondensed matter. We present here some basic ideas about frustration in\nbiomolecules and how the frustration concept leads to a better appreciation of\nmany aspects of the architecture of biomolecules, and how structure connects to\nfunction. These ideas are simultaneously both seductively simple and perilously\nsubtle to grasp completely. The energy landscape theory of protein folding\nprovides a framework for quantifying frustration in large systems and has been\nimplemented at many levels of description. We first review the notion of\nfrustration from the areas of abstract logic and its uses in simple condensed\nmatter systems. We discuss then how the frustration concept applies\nspecifically to heteropolymers, testing folding landscape theory in computer\nsimulations of protein models and in experimentally accessible systems.\nStudying the aspects of frustration averaged over many proteins provides ways\nto infer energy functions useful for reliable structure prediction. We discuss\nhow frustration affects folding, how a large part of the biological functions\nof proteins are related to subtle local frustration effects and how frustration\ninfluences the appearance of metastable states, the nature of binding\nprocesses, catalysis and allosteric transitions. We hope to illustrate how\nFrustration is a fundamental concept in relating function to structural\nbiology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Dec 2013 16:00:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-04"}

The TP-AGB evolutionary models are computed\nwith the COLIBRI code. We adopt our preferred scheme for dust growth. For\nM-giants, we neglect chemisputtering by H$_2$ molecules and, for C-stars we\nassume a homogeneous growth scheme which is primarily controlled by the carbon\nover oxygen excess. At super-solar metallicities, dust forms more efficiently\nand silicates tend to condense significantly closer to the photosphere (r~1.5\nR$_*$) - and thus at higher temperatures and densities - than at solar and\nsub-solar metallicities (r~2-3 R$_*$). In such conditions, the hypothesis of\nthermal decoupling between gas and dust becomes questionable, while dust\nheating due to collisions plays an important role. The heating mechanism delays\ndust condensation to slightly outer regions in the circumstellar envelope. We\nfind that the same mechanism is not significant at solar and sub-solar\nmetallicities. The main dust products at super-solar metallicities are\nsilicates. We calculate the total dust ejecta and dust-to-gas ejecta, for\nvarious values of the stellar initial masses and initial metallicities Z=0.04,\n0.06.

Our framework adheres to the standard rules of quantum\nmechanics and incorporates the quantum fluctuations of the collapsing shell\nspacetime in Hawking's original calculation, while accounting for back-reaction\neffects. We argue that the negative-energy Hawking modes need to be regularly\nintegrated out; and so these are effectively subsumed by the BH and, as a\nresult, the number of coherent negative-energy modes $N_{coh}$ at any given\ntime is parametrically smaller than the total number of the Hawking particles\n$N_{total}$ emitted during the lifetime of the BH. We find that $N_{coh}$ is\ndetermined by the width of the BH wavefunction and scales as the square root of\nthe BH entropy. We also find that the coherent negative-energy modes are\nstrongly entangled with their positive-energy partners. Previously, we have\nfound that $N_{coh}$ is also the number of coherent outgoing particles and that\ninformation can be continually transferred to the outgoing radiation at a rate\nset by $N_{coh}$. Our current results show that, while the BH is semiclassical,\ninformation can be released without jeopardizing the nearly maximal inside-out\nentanglement and imply that the state of matter near the horizon is\napproximately the vacuum.

These populations show differences in their age\nand chemical composition. These differences are found in old- and intermediate-\nage stellar clusters in the Local Group. The observations of young stellar\nsystems are expected to present footprints of multiple stellar populations.\n  Aims: This theoretical work intends to be a specific step in exploring the\nspace of the observational indicators of multipopulations, without covering all\nthe combinations of parameters that may contribute to the formation of multiple\ngenerations of stars in a cluster or in galaxy. The goal is to shed light on\nthe possible observational features expected by core He-burning stars that\nbelong to two stellar populations with different original He content and ages.\n  Methods: The tool adopted was the stellar population synthesis. We used new\nstellar and pulsation models to construct a homogeneous and consistent\nframework.

In order to use these beams in studies of reactions with\ncontrolled collision energies, or in trapping experiments, one needs a method\nof controlling the forward velocity of the beam. A Stark decelerator can be an\neffective tool for controlling the mean speed of molecules produced by\nsupersonic jets, but efficient deceleration of buffer-gas beams presents new\nchallenges due to longer pulse lengths. Traveling-wave decelerators are\nuniquely suited to meet these challenges because of their ability to confine\nmolecules in three dimensions during deceleration and the versatility afforded\nby the analog control of the electrodes.

This rotates the phase-space distribution of the molecular\npacket so that the packet is matched to the time varying phase-space acceptance\nof the decelerator.

This observation spurred numerous\ninvestigations over the past two decades attempting to identify necessary and\nsufficient conditions for complete positivity. Here we describe a complete and\nconsistent mathematical framework for the discussion and analysis of complete\npositivity for correlated initial states of open quantum systems. This\nformalism is built upon a few simple axioms and is sufficiently general to\ncontain all prior methodologies going back to Pechakas, PRL (1994). The key\nobservation is that initial system-bath states with the same reduced state on\nthe system must evolve under all admissible unitary operators to system-bath\nstates with the same reduced state on the system, in order to ensure that the\ninduced dynamical maps on the system are well-defined. Once this consistency\ncondition is imposed, related concepts like the assignment map and the\ndynamical maps are uniquely defined. In general, the dynamical maps may not be\napplied to arbitrary system states, but only to those in an appropriately\ndefined physical domain. We show that the constrained nature of the problem\ngives rise to not one but three inequivalent types of complete positivity.\nUsing this framework we elucidate the limitations of recent attempts to provide\nconditions for complete positivity using quantum discord and the quantum\ndata-processing inequality. The problem remains open, and may require fresh\nperspectives and new mathematical tools. The formalism presented herein may be\none step in that direction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Dec 2013 19:16:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 21 Feb 2014 22:11:55 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 1 Nov 2014 02:05:19 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 18 Mar 2015 11:03:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-22"}

Evidence points towards a\nsecondary origin of the gas as opposed to being a direct remnant form the\ninitial protoplanetary disk, although the dominant gas production mechanism is\nso far not identified. The origin of the observed overabundance of C and O\ncompared to solar abundances of metallic elements, e.g. Na and Fe, is also\nunclear. Aims: Our goal is to constrain the spatial distribution of C in the\ndisk, and thereby the gas origin and its abundance pattern. Methods: We used\nthe HIFI instrument onboard Herschel to observe and spectrally resolve CII\nemission at 158 $\\mu$m from the {\\beta} Pic debris disk. Assuming Keplerian\nrotation, we use the spectrally resolved line profile to constrain the spatial\ndistribution of the gas. Results: We show that most of the gas is located\naround $\\sim$100 AU or beyond. We estimate a total C gas mass of\n$1.3\\times10^{-2}$ M$_\\oplus$. The data suggest that more gas is located on the\nsouthwest side of the disk than on the northeast side. The data are consistent\nwith the hypothesis of a well-mixed gas (constant C/Fe ratio throughout the\ndisk). Assuming instead a spatial profile expected from a simplified accretion\ndisk model, we found it to give a significantly worse fit to the observations.\nConclusions: Since the bulk of the gas is found outside 30 AU, we argue that\nthe cometary objects known as \"falling evaporating bodies\" are unlikely to be\nthe dominant source of gas; production from grain-grain collisions or\nphotodesorption seems more likely. The incompatibility of the observations with\na simplified accretion disk model could favour a preferential depletion\nexplanation for the overabundance of C and O. More stringent constraints on the\nspatial distribution will be available from ALMA observations of CI at 609\n$\\mu$m.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Dec 2013 20:36:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 Jan 2014 15:27:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 12 Mar 2014 10:10:12 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 13 Mar 2014 09:17:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-14"}

The gas\ntemperature therefore rises sharply inwards, producing local saturated Compton\nspectra with rapidly increasing peak energy. These spectra sum together to form\na steep power law tail to the spectrum. A given photon energy on this tail\ncorresponds to a narrow range in radius, so that local vertical oscillations of\nthe disc naturally produce high quality high-frequency quasi-periodic\noscillations (HFQPOs) in the hard X-ray band.

With these observations, dust is\ndetected at 870micron (ALMA Band 7), but 87% of the flux in this band is due to\nfree-free emission from the starburst. We have compiled a spectral energy\ndistribution (SED) of SBS0335-052 that spans almost 6 orders of magnitude in\nwavelength and fit it with a spherical dust shell heated by a single-age\nstellar population; the best-fit model gives a dust mass of (3.8+/-0.6)x10^4\nMsun. We have also constructed a SED including Herschel archival data for\nIZw18, another low-metallicity dwarf starburst (12+log(O/H)=7.17), and fit it\nwith a similar model to obtain a dust mass of (3.4+/-1.0)x10^2 Msun. Compared\nwith their atomic gas mass, the dust mass of SBS0335-052 far exceeds the\nprediction of a linear trend of dust-to-gas mass ratio with metallicity, while\nIZw18 falls far below. We use gas scaling relations to assess a putative\nmissing gas component in both galaxies and find that the missing, possibly\nmolecular, gas in SBS0335-052 is a factor of 6 times higher than the value\ninferred from the observed HI column density; in IZw18 the missing component is\n4 times smaller. Ultimately, despite their similarly low metallicity, the\ndifferences in gas and dust column densities in SBS0335-052 and IZw18 suggest\nthat metal abundance does not uniquely define star-formation processes. At some\nlevel, self-shielding and the survival of molecules may depend just as much on\ngas and dust column density as on metallicity. The effects of low metallicity\nmay at least be partially compensated for by large column densities in the\ninterstellar medium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Dec 2013 21:00:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

However, in Spitzer Infared Spectrograph (IRS) data, few features are\ndetected in most individual spectra because of typically low signal-to-noise\nratios (S/N). By generating spectral composites from over 180 IRS observations\nof Sloan Digital Sky Survey broad-line quasars, we boost the S/N and reveal\nfeatures in the complex spectra that are otherwise lost in the noise. In\naddition to an overall composite, we generate composites in three different\nluminosity bins that span the range of 5.6 micron luminosities of\n10$^{40}$--10$^{46}$ (erg~s$^{-1}$). We detect the high-ionization, forbidden\nemission lines of [SIV], [OIV], and [NeV] 14 micron in all templates and PAH\nfeatures in all but the most luminous template. Ratios of lines with a range of\nionization potentials show no evidence for a strong difference in the shape of\nthe 41--97 eV ionizing continuum over this range of luminosities. The scaling\nof the emission-line luminosities as a function of continuum luminosity is\nconsistent with what is expected, and shows no indication of a ``disappearing\nnarrow-line region.'' The broad 10 and 18 micron silicate features in emission\nincrease in strength with increasing luminosity, and a broad 3--5 micron black\nbody consistent with graphite emission at 750 K is evident in the highest\nluminosity template.

Spitzer\nprovides unprecedented sensitivity in the infrared to study both the jet and\noutflow features, however its spatial resolution is limited by its 0.85m\nmirror. Here we use a high resolution deconvolution algorithm, \"HiRes\", to\nimprove the visualization of spatial morphology by enhancing resolution (to\nsub-arcsecond levels in the IRAC bands) and removing the contaminating\nsidelobes from bright sources in a sample of 89 protostellar objects.

The HiRes fits image\ndata of such a large homogeneous sample presented here will be useful to the\ncommunity in studying these protostellar objects. To illustrate the utility of\nthis HiRes sample, we show how the opening angle of the wide angle outflows in\n31 sources, all observed in the HiRes processed Spitzer images, correlates with\nage.

This answers an even older question posed by Dobkin and Kirkpatrick 30\nyears ago.\n  In addition, we provide an alternative $O(\\log |P| + \\log |Q|)$ algorithm to\ntest the intersection of two convex polygons $P$ and $Q$ in the plane.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Dec 2013 01:42:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Jan 2014 17:53:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 4 Apr 2014 14:26:46 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 19 Feb 2018 16:21:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-20"}

It is\ntherefore surprising that universal EOS-independent relations connecting\ndifferent physical quantities of neutron stars can exist. Lau et al. [ApJ, 714,\n1234 (2010)] found that the frequency of the $f$-mode oscillation, the mass,\nand the moment of inertia are connected by universal relations. More recently,\nYagi and Yunes [Science, 341, 365 (2013)] discovered the I-Love-Q universal\nrelations among the mass, the moment of inertia, the Love number, and the\nquadrupole moment. In this paper, we study these universal relations in the\nEddington-inspired Born-Infeld (EiBI) gravity. This theory differs from general\nrelativity (GR) significantly only at high densities due to the nonlinear\ncoupling between matter and gravity. It thus provides us an ideal case to test\nhow robust the universal relations of NSs are with respect to the change of the\ngravity theory. Thanks to the apparent EOS formulation of EiBI gravity\ndeveloped recently by Delsate and Steinhoff [Phys. Rev. Lett., 109, 021101\n(2012)], we are able to study the universal relations in EiBI gravity using the\nsame techniques as those in GR. We find that the universal relations in EiBI\ngravity are essentially the same as those in GR.

The improvement originates from the physical relationship between\ngalaxy density and peculiar velocity, which substantially reduces cosmic\nvariance. We present the results of Fisher matrix forecasts of correlated\nfields of galaxy density and velocity. Peculiar velocity can improve the growth\nrate constraints by about a factor of two compared to density alone, if we can\nuse all the information for wavenumber k < 0.2 h/Mpc. Future peculiar velocity\nsurveys, TAIPAN, and the all-sky HI surveys, WALLABY and WNSHS, can measure the\ngrowth rate, f*sigma8 to 3 per cent at z ~ 0.025. Although the velocity\nsubsample is about an order of magnitude smaller than the redshift sample from\nthe same survey, it improves the constraint by 40 per cent compared to the same\nsurvey without velocity measurements. Peculiar velocity surveys can also\nmeasure the growth rate as a function of wavenumber with 15-30 per cent\nuncertainties in bins with widths 0.01 h/Mpc in the range 0.02 h/Mpc < k < 0.1\nh/Mpc, which is a large improvement over galaxy density only. Such measurements\non very large scales can detect signatures of modified gravity or\nnon-Gaussianity through scale-dependent growth rate or galaxy bias. We use\nN-body simulations to improve the modelling of auto- and cross-power spectra of\ngalaxy density and peculiar velocity by introducing a new redshift-space\ndistortion term to the velocity, which has been neglected in previous studies.\nThe velocity power spectrum has a damping in redshift space, which is larger\nthan that naively expected from the similar effect in the galaxy power\nspectrum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Dec 2013 05:02:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

Similar to classical interference alignment, the FIA\nprecoder also needs perfect channel state information at all the transmitters\n(CSIT). In this work, a novel Blind Fractional Interference Alignment (B-FIA)\nscheme is introduced, where the basic assumption is that CSIT is not available.\nWe consider two popular channel models, namely: Broadcast channel, and\nInterference channel. For these two channel models, the maximum achievable\nvalue of SpAC satisfying the constraints of the MD detector is obtained, but\nwith no CSIT, and also a precoder design is provided to obtain any value of\nSpAC in the achievable range.\n  Further, the precoder structure provided has one distinct advantage:\ninterference channel state information at the receiver (I-CSIR) is not needed,\nwhen all the transmitters and receivers are equipped with one antenna each.\nWhen two or more antennas are used at both ends, I-CSIR must be available to\nobtain the maximum achievable value of SpAC. The receiver designs for both the\nMinimum Distance and the Maximum Likelihood (ML) decoders are discussed, where\nthe interference statistics is estimated from the received signal samples.\nSimulation results of the B-FIA show that the ML decoder with estimated\nstatistics achieves a significantly better error rate performance when compared\nto the MD decoder with known statistics, since the MD decoder assumes the\ninterference plus noise term as colored Gaussian noise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Dec 2013 06:22:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 Dec 2013 06:57:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-06"}

However, there are many\nuncertainties that reduce the accuracy of these predictions. One such\nuncertainty involves the treatment of low-temperature molecular opacities that\naccount for the surface abundance variations of C, N, and O. A number of prior\ncalculations of intermediate-mass AGB stellar models that incorporate both\nefficient third dredge-up and hot bottom burning include a molecular opacity\ntreatment which does not consider the depletion of C and O due to hot bottom\nburning. Here we update the molecular opacity treatment and investigate the\neffect of this improvement on calculations of intermediate-mass AGB stellar\nmodels. We perform tests on two masses, 5 M$_{\\odot}$ and 6 M$_{\\odot}$, and\ntwo metallicities, $Z~=~0.001$ and $Z~=~0.02$, to quantify the variations\nbetween two opacity treatments. We find that several evolutionary properties\n(e.g. radius, $T_{\\rm eff}$ and $T_{\\rm bce}$) are dependent on the opacity\ntreatment. Larger structural differences occur for the $Z~=~0.001$ models\ncompared to the $Z~=~0.02$ models indicating that the opacity treatment has a\nmore significant effect at lower metallicity. As a consequence of the\nstructural changes, the predictions of isotopic yields are slightly affected\nwith most isotopes experiencing changes up to 60 per cent for the $Z~=~0.001$\nmodels and 20 per cent for the $Z~=~0.02$ models.

We propose a method of\nengineering two-photon spectral amplitude in such a way that it contains\nseveral non-overlapping Schmidt modes, each of which can be filtered\nlosslessly. The method is based on spontaneous parametric down-conversion\n(SPDC) pumped by radiation with a comb-like spectrum. There are many ways of\nproducing such a spectrum; here we consider the simplest one, namely passing\nthe pump beam through a Fabry-Perot interferometer.

With this tutorial, we investigate the variations in the length of the\nsunspot number cycle and examine whether the variability can be explained in\nterms of a secular pattern. We identified long-term cycles in archival data\nfrom 1610 - 2000 using median trace analyses of the cycle length and power\nspectrum analyses of the (O-C) residuals of the dates of sunspot minima and\nmaxima. Median trace analyses of data spanning 385 years indicate a cycle\nlength with a period of 183 - 243 years, and a power spectrum analysis\nidentifies a period of 188 $\\pm$ 38 years. We also find a correspondence\nbetween the times of historic minima and the length of the sunspot cycle, such\nthat the cycle length increases during the time when the number of spots is at\na minimum. In particular, the cycle length was growing during the Maunder\nMinimum when almost no sunspots were visible on the Sun. Our study suggests\nthat the length of the sunspot number cycle should increase gradually, on\naverage, over the next $\\sim$75 years, accompanied by a gradual decrease in the\nnumber of sunspots.

This scheme is able to completely eliminate pilot\ncontamination. The pilot power control for optimizing the multicast beamformer\nat each BS is also derived. Numerical results show that the asymptotic\nperformance of the proposed scheme is close to the ideal case with perfect CSI.\nSimulation also verifies the effectiveness of the proposed scheme with finite\nnumber of antennas at each BS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Dec 2013 12:21:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 May 2014 03:30:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-15"}

Solely four axioms guarantee the optimality in terms of the\nerror estimators.\n  Compared to the state of the art in the temporary literature, the\nimprovements of this article can be summarized as follows: First, a general\nframework is presented which covers the existing literature on optimality of\nadaptive schemes. The abstract analysis covers linear as well as nonlinear\nproblems and is independent of the underlying finite element or boundary\nelement method. Second, efficiency of the error estimator is neither needed to\nprove convergence nor quasi-optimal convergence behavior of the error\nestimator. In this paper, efficiency exclusively characterizes the\napproximation classes involved in terms of the best-approximation error and\ndata resolution and so the upper bound on the optimal marking parameters does\nnot depend on the efficiency constant. Third, some general quasi-Galerkin\northogonality is not only sufficient, but also necessary for the $R$-linear\nconvergence of the error estimator, which is a fundamental ingredient in the\ncurrent quasi-optimality analysis due to Stevenson 2007. Finally, the general\nanalysis allows for equivalent error estimators and inexact solvers as well as\ndifferent non-homogeneous and mixed boundary conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Dec 2013 14:11:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-14"}

This paper presents a study of all co-spherical elements that appear\nwhile tessellating a 1-irregular cuboid (cuboid with at most one Steiner point\non its edges) with different aspect ratio. Steiner points can be located at any\nposition between the edge endpoints. When Steiner points are located at edge\nmidpoints, 24 co-spherical elements appear while tessellating 1-irregular\ncubes. By inserting internal faces and edges to these new elements, this number\nis reduced to 13.

If\n1-irregular cuboids have aspect ratio between 1 and $\\sqrt{2}$, all the\ntessellations are adequate for the finite volume method.

In algebraic terms, this\nis due to the presence of a center --- a set of operators which commute with\nall others --- in the gauge invariant operator algebra corresponding to finite\nregion. A unique entropy can be assigned to algebras with center, giving place\nto a local entropy in lattice gauge theories. However, ambiguities arise on the\ncorrespondence between algebras and regions. In particular, it is always\npossible to choose (in many different ways) local algebras with trivial center,\nand hence a genuine entanglement entropy, for any region. These choices are in\ncorrespondence with maximal trees of links on the boundary, which can be\ninterpreted as partial gauge fixings. This interpretation entails a gauge\nfixing dependence of the entanglement entropy. In the continuum limit however,\nambiguities in the entropy are given by terms local on the boundary of the\nregion, in such a way relative entropy and mutual information are finite,\nuniversal, and gauge independent quantities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Dec 2013 14:38:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-23"}

The interpretation of this has\nbeen the subject of considerable debate, and it has been suggested that all\nredshifts are a relative velocity effect, raising the question of whether the\nwavelength always stretches in proportion to the emitter-receiver separation.\nHere we show that, for low redshift at least, $\\Delta\\log(\\lambda / D)$\nvanishes for a photon exchanged between any two freely-falling observers in a\nspatially constant tidal field, because such a field stretches wavelengths and\nthe space between the observers identically.

However, identifying\nthe sources (comets, meteorites, and trapped nebular gas) that supplied\nvolatiles to Earth is not straightforward because secondary processes like\nmantle degassing, crustal recycling, and escape to space modified the\ncomposition of the atmosphere. Here, we review two complementary approaches to\ninvestigate the origin of Earth's atmosphere and oceans. The geochemical\napproach uses volatile element abundances and isotopic compositions to identify\nthe possible contributors to the atmosphere and to disentangle the processes\nthat shaped it. In that respect, noble gases (He, Ne, Ar, Kr, and Xe), elements\nthat are chemically inert and possess several isotopes produced by\nradioactivity, play a critical role. The dynamical approach uses our knowledge\nof planetary dynamics to track volatile delivery to the Earth, starting with\ndust transport in the disk to planet-building processes. The main conclusion is\nthat Earth acquired most of its major volatile elements by accretion of\nplanetesimals or embryos akin to volatile-rich meteorites. At the same time,\nsolar/meteoritic noble gases were captured by embryos and some gases were lost\nto space, by hydrodynamic escape and large impacts. Comets did not contribute\nmuch H, C, and N but may have delivered significant noble gases, which could\nrepresent the only fingerprints of the bombardment of our planet with icy\nbodies. The processes that governed the delivery of volatile elements to the\nEarth are thought to be relatively common and it is likely that Earth-like\nplanets covered with oceans exist in extra-solar systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Dec 2013 15:18:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-05"}

In the case of the gluon propagator, these effects do not interfere\nwith its finiteness, but make its first derivative diverge at the origin, and\nintroduce a maximum in the region of infrared momenta. The three-gluon vertex\nis also affected, and the induced divergent behavior is clearly exposed in\ncertain special kinematic configurations, usually considered in lattice\nsimulations; the sign of the corresponding divergence is unambiguously\ndetermined. The main underlying concepts are developed in the context of a\nsimple toy model, which demonstrates clearly the interconnected nature of the\nvarious effects.

The former reflects the nonseparability between\na system and a classical environment as the latter for a quantum environment,\nand the concept of geometric time-energy uncertainty can be adopted as a\nsignature of the nonseparability. Based on this viewpoint, we study their\nrelationship in the quantum-classical transition of the environment, with the\naid of a spin-half particle (qubit) model exposed to a quantum-classical hybrid\nfield. In the quantum-classical transition, the Berry phase has a similar\nconnection with the time-energy uncertainty as the case with only a classical\nfield, whereas the geometric phase for the mixed state of the qubit exhibits a\ncomplementary relationship with the entanglement. Namely, for a fixed\ntime-energy uncertainty, the entanglement is gradually replaced by the mixed\ngeometric phase as the quantum field vanishes. And the mixed geometric phase\nbecomes the Berry phase in the classical limit. The same results can be draw\nout from a displaced harmonic oscillator model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Dec 2013 15:47:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 15 Dec 2013 14:52:44 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 27 Dec 2013 01:33:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-30"}

We\ntest the performance of different solar wind models, namely Magnetohydrodynamic\nAlgorithm outside a Sphere/ENLIL (MAS/ENLIL), Wang-Sheeley-Arge/ENLIL\n(WSA/ENLIL), and MAS/MAS, by comparing model results with in-situ measurements\nfrom spacecraft located at 1 AU distance to the Sun (ACE, Wind).
