The connection coefficients of these two algebraic\nstructures are of significant interest in the study of Schur and zonal\npolynomials as well as the irreducible characters of the symmetric group and\nthe zonal spherical functions. Furthermore they play an important role in\ncombinatorics as they give the number of factorizations of a permutation into a\nproduct of permutations with given cyclic properties. Usually studied\nseparately, these two families of coefficients share strong similar properties.\nFirst (partially) introduced by Goulden and Jackson in 1996, Jack connection\ncoefficients provide a natural unified approach closely related to the theory\nof Jack polynomials, a family of bases in the ring of symmetric functions\nindexed by a parameter \\alpha that generalizes both Schur (case \\alpha = 1) and\nzonal polynomials (case \\alpha = 2). Jack connection coefficients are also\ndirectly linked to Jack characters, a general view of the characters of the\nsymmetric group and the zonal spherical functions. Goulden and Jackson\nconjectured that these coefficients are polynomials in \\alpha with nice\ncombinatorial properties, the so-called Matchings-Jack conjecture. In this\npaper, we use the theory of Jack symmetric functions and the Laplace Beltrami\noperator to show the polynomial properties of Jack connection coefficients in\nsome important cases.

From all the\npossible extensions of the standard inflationary model, we chose to study\ntwo-field models with canonical kinetic terms and flat field space. The new\nfeature is the presence of the so-called isocurvature perturbation. Its\ninterplay with the adiabatic perturbation outside the horizon gives birth to\nnon-linearities characteristic of multiple-field models. In this context, we\nestablished the second-order gauge-invariant form of the adiabatic and\nisocurvature perturbation and found the third-order action that describes their\ninteractions. Furthermore, we built on and elaborated the long-wavelength\nformalism in order to acquire an expression for the parameter of\nnon-Gaussianity fNL as a function of the potential of the fields. We next used\nthis formula to study analytically, within the slow-roll hypothesis, general\nclasses of potentials and verified our results numerically for the exact\ntheory.

However, ASP cannot easily be used for reasoning about\nuncertain information. Possibilistic ASP (PASP) is an extension of ASP that\ncombines possibilistic logic and ASP. In PASP a weight is associated with each\nrule, where this weight is interpreted as the certainty with which the\nconclusion can be established when the body is known to hold. As such, it\nallows us to model and reason about uncertain information in an intuitive way.\nIn this paper we present new semantics for PASP, in which rules are interpreted\nas constraints on possibility distributions. Special models of these\nconstraints are then identified as possibilistic answer sets. In addition,\nsince ASP is a special case of PASP in which all the rules are entirely\ncertain, we obtain a new characterization of ASP in terms of constraints on\npossibility distributions. This allows us to uncover a new form of disjunction,\ncalled weak disjunction, that has not been previously considered in the\nliterature. In addition to introducing and motivating the semantics of weak\ndisjunction, we also pinpoint its computational complexity. In particular,\nwhile the complexity of most reasoning tasks coincides with standard\ndisjunctive ASP, we find that brave reasoning for programs with weak\ndisjunctions is easier.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Nov 2013 17:12:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-19"}

Time series of behavioral actions show\nsimilar high levels of predictability, even when temporal correlations are\nneglected. Entropy conditional on specific behavioral actions reveals that in\nterms of predictability negative behavior has a wider variety than positive\nactions. The actions which contain information to best predict an individual's\nsubsequent action are negative, such as attacks or enemy markings, while\npositive actions of friendship marking, trade and communication contain the\nleast amount of predictive information.

Superhydrophobic (perfect-slip vs. no-slip)\nstripes are characterized by a texture period L and a fraction of the gas area\n$\\phi$. For very large values of h/R we recover the macroscopic formulae for a\nsphere moving towards a hydrophilic no-slip plane.

Finally, we investigate the lateral force on the sphere, which is\ndetectable in case of very small separations and is maximized by stripes with\n$\\phi=0.5$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Dec 2013 10:48:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 3 Jan 2014 10:27:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-24"}

The main idea of the data-driven time-frequency\nanalysis is to decompose a multiscale signal into a sparsest collection of\nIntrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs) over the largest possible dictionary via\nnonlinear optimization. These IMFs are of the form $a(t) \\cos(\\theta(t))$ where\nthe amplitude $a(t)$ is positive and slowly varying. The non-decreasing phase\nfunction $\\theta(t)$ is determined by the data and in general depends on the\nsignal in a nonlinear fashion. One of the main results of this paper is that we\nshow that each IMF can be associated with a solution of a second order ordinary\ndifferential equation of the form $\\ddot{x}+p(x,t)\\dot{x}+q(x,t)=0$. Further,\nwe propose a localized variational formulation for this problem and develop an\neffective $l^1$-based optimization method to recover $p(x,t)$ and $q(x,t)$ by\nlooking for a sparse representation of $p$ and $q$ in terms of the polynomial\nbasis.

Therefore, these measurements have the potential to provide direct\nobservational evidence of possible binary formation scenarios. The above\nstatements should also apply for binaries that do not remain in a resonant\nplane when they become detectable by GW interferometers. The resonant plane,\ncharacterized by the vanishing scalar triple product involving the two spins\nand the orbital angular momentum, naturally appears in the one parameter family\nof equilibrium solutions, discovered by Schnittman.

In\naddition, the doping density (and conductivity) of the host can be easily\ncontrolled by adjusting the thickness of the bottom F4TCNQ layer. This\nalternative scheme for doping is simpler than the conventional way of doping\nsmall molecules which involves simultaneous co-evaporation of host and dopant.\nIn the sequential doping scheme outlined here, bulk doping of the host takes\nplace due to rapid diffusion of F4TCNQ in the host material. The motion of\nF4TCNQ in the host is complex and is not always described by a simple diffusion\nprocess. In situ transport measurements provide a quick and easy way of\nmeasuring dopant diffusion in new hosts.

The basis of counting law of NG bosons in the anomalous NG\ntheorem is examined by Lie algebras (local) and Lie groups (global). A\nquasi-Heisenberg algebra is found generically in various symmetry breaking\nschema of the anomalous NG theorem, and it indicates that it causes a\nviolation/modification of the Heisenberg uncertainty relation in an NG sector\nwhich can be experimentally confirmed. The formalism of effective potential is\npresented for understanding the mechanism of anomalous NG theorem with the aid\nof our result of Lie algebras. After an investigation on a bosonic kaon\ncondensation model with a finite chemical potential as an explicit\nLorentz-symmetry-breaking parameter, a model Lagrangian approach on the\nanomalous NG theorem is given for our general discussion. Not only the\ncondition of the counting law of true NG bosons, but also the mechanism to\ngenerate a mass of massive NG boson is also found by our examination on the\nkaon condensation model. Furthermore, the generation of a massive mode in the\nNG sector is understood by the quantum uncertainty relation of the Heisenberg\nalgebra, obtained from a symmetry breaking of a Lie algebra, which realizes in\nthe effective potential of the kaon condensation model. Hence the relation\nbetween a symmetry breaking scheme, a Heisenberg algebra, a mode-mode coupling,\nand the mechanism of mass generation in an NG sector is established. Finally,\nsome relations between the Riemann hypothesis and the anomalous NG theorem are\npresented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Dec 2013 05:35:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-04"}
