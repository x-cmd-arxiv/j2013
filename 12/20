We redetermine the Ni abundance of this star and compare it with new\nabundance data from stars of the Galactic disk, finding that [Ni/Fe] is about\n1.7 sigma above the Galactic trend. From the high velocity (v_b = -50+/-14\nkm/s) of Tycho-G perpendicular to the Galactic plane, its metallicity, and its\nNi excess, we find the probability of its being a chance interloper to be P <\n0.00037 at most. The projected rotational velocity of the star should be below\ncurrent observational limits. The projected position of Tycho-G is, within the\nuncertainties, consistent with the centroid of the X-ray emission of Tycho's\nSNR; moreover, its brightness is generally consistent with the post-explosion\nevolution of the luminosity of a SN companion. Among the other 23 stars having\nV<22 mag and located within 42 arcsec from the X-ray centroid, only 4 are at\ndistances compatible with that of the SNR, and none of them shows any\npeculiarity. Therefore, if even Tycho-G is not the surviving companion of SN\n1572, the absence of other viable candidates does favor the merging of two\nwhite dwarfs as the producer of the SN.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Dec 2013 17:05:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-05"}

The\ngoal of this study is to develop a mathematical framework to obtain drug and\nradiation administration schedules that maximize the therapeutic gain for\nconcurrent chemoradiotherapy. In particular, we analyze the impact of\nincorporating these two mechanisms into the radiation fractionation problem.\nConsidering each mechanism individually, we first derive closed-form\nexpressions for the optimal radiation fractionation regimen and the\ncorresponding drug administration schedule. We next study the case in which\nboth mechanisms are simultaneously present and develop a dynamic programming\nframework to determine optimal treatment regimens.

As for\nthe electrical base unit \"Ampere\", it will be linked to the elementary charge\ne, requiring a corresponding quantum standard [2, 3]. Many concepts for such a\nstandard have been investigated [4-14] relying on controlling the\ntime-dependent tunnelling of electrons. However, the stochastic nature of\nquantum mechanical tunnelling intrinsically evokes uncontrolled deviations from\nthe nominally quantized current. Alternatively, the counting of electrons [15,\n16] has been explored but is severely limited in current amplitude and\nuncertainty by the low detector bandwidth. The late M. Wulf proposed [17] that\nthis fundamental problem of electrical quantum metrology could be overcome by\ncombining serial single-electron pumps with charge detectors allowing the\ngeneration of a quantized current and the in-situ detection of its stochastic\ndeviations. Here, we experimentally demonstrate such quantized-current\ngeneration with in-situ detection of tunnelling errors at low frequencies and a\nreduction of the total current uncertainty by more than one order of magnitude.\nAfter frequency scaling this should enable a validated primary standard for the\nredefined SI base unit Ampere.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Dec 2013 17:56:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-10"}

This is also a variant of the so-called chase-escape process\nintroduced by Kordzakhia and then Bordenave & Ganesan. Our work is the first\nstudy of this dynamics on complete graphs. Starting with one infected and one\nrecovered individuals on the complete graph with $N+2$ vertices, and stopping\nthe process when one type of individuals disappears, we study the asymptotic\nbehavior of the probability that the infection spreads to the whole graph as\n$N\\rightarrow\\infty$ and show that for $\\lambda\\in (0,1)$ (resp. for\n$\\lambda>1$), the infection dies out (resp. does not die out) with probability\ntending to one as $N\\rightarrow\\infty$, and that the probability that the\ninfection dies out tends to $1/2$ for $\\lambda=1$. We also establish limit\ntheorems concerning the asymptotic state of the system in all regimes and show\nthat two additional phase transitions occur in the subcritical phase\n$\\lambda\\in (0,1)$: at $\\lambda=1/2$ the behavior of the expected number of\nremaining infected individuals changes, while at $\\lambda=(\\sqrt {5}-1)/2$ the\nbehavior of the expected number of remaining recovered individuals changes. We\nalso study the outbreak sizes of the infection, and show that the outbreak\nsizes are small if $\\lambda \\in(0,1/2]$, exhibit a power-law behavior for\n$1/2<\\lambda<1$, and are pandemic for $\\lambda\\geq 1$. Our method relies on\ndifferent couplings: we first couple the dynamics with two independent Yule\nprocesses by using an Athreya-Karlin embedding, and then we couple the Yule\nprocesses with Poisson processes thanks to Kendall's representation of Yule\nprocesses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Dec 2013 18:11:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Jan 2014 16:15:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 3 Oct 2014 09:01:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-19"}

While disks around young stellar\nobjects have been identified through thermal dust emission, spatially and\nspectrally resolved molecular line observations are needed to determine their\nnature. We present subarcsecond observations of dust and gas toward four Class\nI low-mass young stellar objects in Taurus. The 13CO and C18O J=2-1 transitions\nat 220 GHz were observed with the Plateau de Bure Interferometer at a spatial\nresolution of ~0.8'' and analyzed using uv-space position velocity diagrams to\ndetermine the nature of their observed velocity radient. Rotationally supported\ndisks (RSDs) are detected around 3 of the 4 Class I sources studied. The\nderived masses identify them as Stage I objects; i.e., their stellar mass is\nhigher than their envelope and disk masses. The outer radii of the Keplerian\ndisks toward our sample of Class I sources are <~ 100 AU. The lack of on-source\nC18O emission for TMR1 puts an upper limit of 50 AU on its size. Flattened\nstructures at radii > 100 AU around these sources are dominated by infalling\nmotion (v propto r^-1). A large-scale envelope model is required to estimate\nthe basic parameters of the flattened structure from spatially resolved\ncontinuum data. Similarities and differences between the gas and dust disk are\ndiscussed. Combined with literature data, the sizes of the RSDs around Class I\nobjects are best described with evolutionary models with an initial rotation of\n10^-14 Hz and slow sound speeds. Based on the comparison of gas and dust disk\nmasses, little CO is frozen out within 100 AU in these disks. RSDs with radii\nup to 100 AU are present around Class I embedded objects. Larger surveys of\nboth Class 0 and I objects are needed to determine whether most disks form late\nor early in the embedded phase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Dec 2013 19:58:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

These degeneracies cannot be broken by the CMB constraint on the\neffective number of neutrinos, N_eff. However, big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN)\nis affected by a light WIMP and equivalent neutrinos, so the combination of BBN\nand CMB can break some of the degeneracies.

We report here on 3D semi-spherical bubble events, where instead of\nsimple magnetic footpoints, we observe complex semi-circular feet straddling a\nfew granules. The most characteristic signature in these events is the\nobservation of a dark bubble in filtergrams taken in the wings of the Ca II\n854.2 nm line. We can infer how the bubble rises through the solar atmosphere\nas we see it progressing from the wings to the core of Ca II 854.2 nm. In the\nphotosphere, the magnetic bubble shows mean upward Doppler velocities of 2\nkm/s. In about 3.5 minutes it travels some 1100 km to reach the mid\nchromosphere, implying an average ascent speed of 5.2 km/s. To aid the\ninterpretation of the observations, we carry out 3D numerical simulations of\nthe evolution of a horizontal, untwisted magnetic flux sheet injected in the\nconvection zone, using the Bifrost code. The computational domain spans from\nthe upper convection zone to the lower corona. In the modeled chromosphere the\nrising flux sheet produces a large, cool, magnetized bubble. We compare this\nbubble with the observed ones and find excellent agreement, including similar\nfield strengths and velocity signals in the photosphere and chromosphere,\ntemperature deficits, ascent speeds, expansion velocities, and lifetimes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Dec 2013 20:48:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

The quantum\nnature of the nuclear bath, along with the interplay of coherent external\nfields and incoherent dynamics in these systems renders a wealth of intriguing\nphenomena seen in recent experiments such as electron Zeeman frequency\nfocusing, hysteresis, and line dragging. We develop in detail a fully quantum,\nself-consistent theory that can be applied to such experiments and that\nmoreover has predictive power. Our theory uses the operator sum representation\nformalism in order to incorporate the incoherent dynamics caused by the\nadditional, Markovian bath, which in self-assembled dots is the vacuum field\nresponsible for electron-hole optical recombination. The beauty of this\nformalism is that it reduces the complexity of the problem by encoding the\njoint dynamics of the external coherent and incoherent driving in an effective\ndynamical map that only acts on the electron spin subspace. This together with\nthe separation of timescales in the problem allows for a tractable and\nanalytically solvable formalism.

QLE is defined in terms of the radial\nLoewner equation like radial SLE, except that it is driven by a measure valued\ndiffusion $\\nu_t$ derived from LQG rather than a multiple of a standard\nBrownian motion. We formalize the dynamics of $\\nu_t$ using an SPDE.

A certain\n\"reshuffling\" trick (in which concentric annular regions are rotated randomly,\nlike slot machine reels) facilitates explicit calculation.\n  We propose QLE$(2,1)$ as a scaling limit for DLA on a random\nspanning-tree-decorated planar map, and QLE$(8/3,0)$ as a scaling limit for the\nEden model on a random triangulation. We propose using QLE$(8/3,0)$ to endow\npure LQG with a distance function, by interpreting the region explored by a\nbranching variant of QLE$(8/3,0)$, up to a fixed time, as a metric ball in a\nrandom metric space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Dec 2013 20:31:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-22"}

We analyzed quasi-periodicity of the hard-X-ray\n(HXR) pulses in the flare impulsive phase and found close similarity between\nthe quasi-periodic sequence of the pulses with that observed in another large\narcade flare of 2 November 1991. This similarity helped to explain the strong\nHXR pulses which were recorded at the end of the impulsive phase, as due to an\ninflow of dense plasma (coming from the chromospheric evaporation) into the\nacceleration volume inside the cusp. In HXR images a high flaring loop was seen\nwith a triangular cusp structure at the top, where the electrons were\nefficiently accelerated. The sequence of HXR images allowed us to investigate\ncomplicated changes in the precipitation of the accelerated electrons toward\nthe flare footpoints.

In order to\ncompare the lattice simulations with experiment, calculation of partial\nquenching and finite-volume effects is required prior to an extrapolation in\nquark mass to the physical point. These dependencies are described using chiral\neffective field theory. Corrections to the partial quenching effects associated\nwith the sea-quark-loop electric charges are estimated by modelling corrections\nto the pion cloud. These are compared to the uncorrected lattice results. In\naddition, the behaviour of the finite-volume corrections as a function of pion\nmass is explored. Box sizes of approximately 7 fm are required to achieve a\nresult within 5% of the infinite-volume result at the physical pion mass. A\nvariety of extrapolations are shown at different box sizes, providing a\nbenchmark to guide future lattice QCD calculations of the magnetic\npolarizabilities.

All models have\nconsistently predicted qualitatively that the pion-/pion+ ratio is a sensitive\nprobe of the high-density symmetry energy especially with beam energies near\nthe pion production threshold. However, the predicted values of the pion-/pion+\nratio are still quite model dependent mostly because of the complexity of\nmodeling pion production and reabsorption dynamics in heavy-ion collisions,\nleading to currently still controversial conclusions regarding the high-density\nbehavior of nuclear symmetry energy from comparing various model calculations\nwith available experimental data. As more pion-/pion+ data become available and\na deeper understanding about the pion dynamics in heavy-ion reactions is\nobtained, more penetrating probes, such as the kaon+/kaon0 ratio, eta meson and\nhigh energy photons are also being investigated or planned at several\nfacilities. Here, we review some of our recent contributions to the community\neffort of constraining the high-density behavior of nuclear symmetry energy in\nheavy-ion collisions. In addition, the status of some worldwide experiments for\nstudying the high-density symmetry energy, including the HIRFL-CSR external\ntarget experiment (CEE) are briefly introduced.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Dec 2013 01:34:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-27"}

These\nare (1) the recognition from reverberation mapping that a relationship exists\nbetween the optical/UV luminosity and the distance of line-emitting gas from\nthe central ionizing source. Thus, together with a measurement of the velocity\nof the line-emitting gas, e.g., via the width of BLR lines, such as Mg II, a\nsingle observation can therefore in principle provide a determination of the\nblack hole's mass; and (2) the identification of quasar ULAS J1120+0641 at z =\n7.085, which has significantly extended the redshift range of these sources,\nproviding essential leverage when fitting theoretical luminosity distances to\nthe data. In this paper, we use the observed fluxes and Mg II line-widths of\nthese sources to show that one may reasonably test the predicted high-z\ndistance versus redshift relationship, and we assemble a sample of 20 currently\navailable high-z quasars for this exercise.

The\n$(3/2,0)\\oplus(0,3/2)$ sector of interest is tracked down in two steps.

The latter projectors unambiguously identify any irreducible\n$so(1,3)$ subspace of any Lorentz tensor and without rising the order of the\ndifferential equation. The method proposed correctly reproduces the\nelectromagnetic multipole moments earlier calculated for single spin-$3/2$\nparticles in treating it in the standard way as eight dimensional spinor.

The evolution of the scale factor\nof the extra dimension (whose dynamics is influenced by the Gauss-Bonnet term)\nacts as the cause for the breaking of conformal invariance. Different cases\nhave been investigated, each of which is characterized by the number of higher\ndimensions, the value of the Gauss-Bonnet parameter, and the cosmological\nconstant.

Under some optimized conditions, the injection region is well\nlimited within $200\\rm \\mu m$ and the electron beam with central energy of 383\nMeV, energy spread of 3.33% in FWHM, normalized emittance of 3.12 mm mrad and\ncharge of 14.58 pC can be obtained according to particle-in-cell simulations.\nBoth multi-dimensional simulations and theoretical analysis illustrate the\neffectiveness of this scheme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Dec 2013 06:57:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

The power and energy of the particle emission behave in two distinct\nways depending on a parameter in the model. In a generic case, the emission\npower is proportional to the quadratic inverse of the remaining time to the\nCauchy horizon, which has been known for the four-dimensional case in the\nliterature. On the other hand, in a degenerate case the emission power is\nproportional to the quartic inverse of the remaining time to the Cauchy\nhorizon, and depends on the total mass of a dust fluid in spite that the\ncentral region of the collapse is scale-free due to the self-similarity.

In addition to\nusing kinematic information (from sky position and proper motion), this\nanalysis exploits 2MASS-WISE color-magnitude diagrams in which old and young\nobjects follow distinct sequences. As an improvement over our earlier work, the\nspatial and kinematic distributions for each association are now modelled as\nellipsoids whose axes need not be aligned with the Galactic coordinate axes,\nand we use prior probabilities matching the expected populations of the NYAs\nconsidered versus field stars. We present an extensive contamination analysis\nto characterize the performance of our new method.

It is well\nknown that their interaction leads to intractability or undecidability of query\nanswering even in the case of simple subclasses. Several conditions have been\nfound to guarantee separability, that is lack of interaction, between TGDs and\nEGDs. Separability makes EGDs (mostly) irrelevant for query answering and\ntherefore often guarantees tractability, as long as the theory is satisfiable.\nIn this paper we review the two notions of separability found in the\nliterature, as well as several syntactic conditions that are sufficient to\nprove them. We then shed light on the issue of satisfiability checking, showing\nthat under a sufficient condition called deep separability it can be done by\nconsidering the TGDs only.\n  We show that, fortunately, in the case of TGDs and EGDs, separability implies\ndeep separability. This result generalizes several analogous ones, proved ad\nhoc for particular classes of constraints. Applications include the class of\nsticky TGDs and EGDs, for which we provide a syntactic separability condition\nwhich extends the analogous one for linear TGDs; preliminary experiments show\nthe feasibility of query answering in this case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Dec 2013 12:18:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 31 Dec 2013 09:42:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-03"}

Companion masses are found mostly in 0.1-1 Msun mass range with peak\nat 0.6 Msun. The formation of these systems is believed to involve a common\nenvelope phase, initiated by a BH progenitor, expected to be a massive star >20\nMsun. It was realized that it may be very problematic for a low-mass companion\nto eject a massive envelope of the black hole progenitor. It invoked\nsuggestions that an intermediate-mass companion ejects the envelope, and then\nis shredded by the Roche-lobe overflow to its current low-mass. But this\ncreates another issue; a temperature mismatch between hot models and the\nobserved cool low-mass donors. Finally, the main driver of Roche-lobe overflow\nthat is believed to be magnetic braking does not seem to follow any\ntheoretically calculated models. Number of ideas were put forward to explain\nvarious parts of this conundrum; pre-main sequence donor nature, alternative\napproach to magnetic braking and common envelope energy was revisited. We test\nvarious proposals and models to show that no overall solution exists so far. We\nargue that common envelope physics is not crucial in the understanding BH\ntransient physical properties, but may affect significantly their formation\nrates.

Because\nthe interference received at each antenna originates from the same set of\ninterferers, but partially de-correlates over the fading channel, it possesses\na complex correlation structure. This work develops a realistic analytic model\nthat accurately accounts for the interference correlation using stochastic\ngeometry. Modeling interference by a Poisson shot noise process with\nindependent Nakagami fading, we derive the link success probability for\ndual-branch interference-aware MRC. Using this result, we show that the common\nassumption that all receive antennas experience equal interference power\nunderestimates the true performance, although this gap rapidly decays with\nincreasing the Nakagami parameter $m_{\\text{I}}$ of the interfering links.
