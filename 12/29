Since human faces exist abundant shape features, we address\nthe face representation issue from the perspective of the shape feature\nextraction. In our approach, we divide faces into a number of tiny shape\nfragments and reduce these shape fragments to several uniform atomic shape\npatterns called Shape Primitives. A convolution with Haar Wavelet templates is\napplied to each shape fragment to identify its belonging shape primitive. After\nthat, we do a histogram statistic of shape primitives in each spatial local\nimage patch for incorporating the spatial information. Finally, each face is\nrepresented as a feature vector via concatenating all the local histograms of\nshape primitives. Four popular face databases, namely ORL, AR, Yale-B and LFW-a\ndatabases, are employed to evaluate SPH and experimentally study the choices of\nthe parameters.

An important question for such nonlocal games is\ntheir behavior under parallel repetition. For two-player nonlocal games, it is\nknown that both the classical and the non-signaling value of any game converges\nto zero exponentially fast under parallel repetition, given that the game is\nnon-trivial to start with (i.e., has classical/non-signaling value <1). Very\nrecent results show similar behavior for the quantum value of a two-player game\nunder parallel repetition. For nonlocal games with three or more players, very\nlittle is known up to present on their behavior under parallel repetition; this\nis true for the classical, the quantum and the non-signaling value.\n  In this work, we show a parallel repetition theorem for the non-signaling\nvalue of a large class of multi-player games, for an arbitrary number of\nplayers. Our result applies to all multi-player games for which all possible\ncombinations of questions have positive probability; this class in particular\nincludes all free games, in which the questions to the players are chosen\nindependently. Specifically, we prove that if the original game has a\nnon-signaling value smaller than 1, then the non-signaling value of the\n$n$-fold parallel repetition is exponentially small in $n$.\n  Our parallel repetition theorem for multi-player games is weaker than the\nknown parallel repetition results for two-player games in that the rate at\nwhich the non-signaling value of the game decreases not only depends on the\nnon-signaling value of the original game (and the number of possible\nresponses), but on the complete description of the game. Nevertheless, we feel\nthat our result is a first step towards a better understanding of the parallel\nrepetition of nonlocal games with more than two players.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Dec 2013 17:46:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Jun 2014 19:26:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-15"}

The Reissner-Nordstrom dynamics exhibit\nsaddle-center, transcritical, pseudo-transcritical, and additional bifurcations\nthat combine all three previous bifurcations in various combinations.\nPeriastron precession in the Reissner-Nordstrom spacetime is analyzed using the\nphase-plane and bifurcation techniques and extended to include a bifurcation\npoint of the dynamics. A numerical solution at these parameter values\nillustrates that such orbits typically yield a much larger precession value\ncompared to the standard value for timelike, precession. The acausal geodesics\nconsidered by Brigman are also discussed and their precession value is\ncalculated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Dec 2013 04:58:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-31"}

The mechanical resonator\nis capacitively coupled to the CPT, such that mechanical displacements of the\nresonator cause a shift in the CPT inductance and hence the cavity's resonant\nfrequency. The amplification provided by the CPT is sufficient for the zero\npoint motion of the mechanical resonator alone to cause a significant change in\nthe cavity resonance. Conversely, a single photon in the cavity causes a shift\nin the mechanical resonator position on the order of its zero point motion. As\na result, the cavity-Cooper pair transistor (cCPT) coupled to a mechanical\nresonator will be able to access a regime in which single photons can affect\nsingle phonons and vice versa. Realizing this ultra-strong coupling regime will\nfacilitate the creation of non-classical states of the mechanical resonator, as\nwell as the means to accurately characterize such states by measuring the\ncavity photon field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Dec 2013 11:20:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-13"}

This\npaper views macroprudential oversight in Europe as a process, a sequence of\nactivities with the ultimate aim of safeguarding financial stability. To\nconceptualize a process in this context, we introduce the notion of a public\ncollaborative process (PCP). PCPs involve multiple organizations with a common\nobjective, where a number of dispersed organizations cooperate under various\nunstructured forms and take a collaborative approach to reaching the final\ngoal. We argue that PCPs can and should essentially be managed using the tools\nand practices common for business processes. To this end, we conduct an\nassessment of process readiness for macroprudential oversight in Europe. Based\nupon interviews with key European policymakers and supervisors, we provide an\nanalysis model to assess the maturity of five process enablers for\nmacroprudential oversight. With the results of our analysis, we give clear\nrecommendations on the areas that need further attention when macroprudential\noversight is being developed, in addition to providing a general purpose\nframework for monitoring the impact of improvement efforts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Dec 2013 15:01:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Sep 2014 15:18:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-10"}

Here, we review and extend that work, giving not\nonly a detailed account of full GW+DMFT calculations, but also discussing and\ntesting simplified approximate schemes. We give insights into the nature of\nexchange and correlation effects: Dynamical renormalizations in the Fermi\nliquid regime of SrVO3 are essentially local, and nonlocal correlations mainly\nact to screen the Fock exchange term. The latter substantially widens the\nquasi-particle band structure, while the band narrowing induced by the former\nis accompanied by a spectral weight transfer to higher energies. Most\ninterestingly, the exchange broadening is much more pronounced in the\nunoccupied part of spectrum. As a result, the GW+DMFT electronic structure of\nSrVO3 resembles the conventional density functional based dynamical mean field\n(DFT+DMFT) description for occupied states, but is profoundly modified in the\nempty part. Our work leads to a reinterpretation of inverse photoemission\nspectroscopy (IPES) data. Indeed, we assign a prominent peak at about 2.7 eV\ndominantly to eg states, rather than to an upper Hubbard band of t2g character.\nSimilar surprises can be expected for other transition metal oxides, calling\nfor more detailed investigations of the conduction band states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Dec 2013 15:01:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-16"}

Quantum\ninformation is construed as a technique for analyzing a logical system subject\nto classical constraints, based on a question-and-answer procedure. The problem\nis posed from a particular batch of queries while the constraints are\nrepresented by the truth table of a set of Boolean functions. The Bayesian\ninference technique consists in assigning a probability distribution within a\nreal-valued probability space to the joint set of queries in order to satisfy\nthe constraints. The initial query batch is not unique and alternative batches\ncan be considered at will. They are enabled mechanically from the initial\nbatch, quite simply by transcribing the probability space into a Hilbert space.\nIt turns out that this sole procedure leads to exactly recover the standard\nquantum information theory and thus provides an information-theoretic rationale\nto its technical rules. In this framework, the great challenges of quantum\nmechanics become simple platitudes: Why is the theory probabilistic? Why is the\ntheory linear? Where does the Hilbert space come from? In addition, most of the\nparadoxes, such as uncertainty principle, entanglement, contextuality,\nnonsignaling correlation, measurement problem, etc., become straightforwards\nfeatures. In the end, our major conclusion is that quantum information is\nnothing but classical information processed by a mature form of Bayesian\ninference technique and, as such, consubstantial with Aristotelian logic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Dec 2013 15:40:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 28 Sep 2014 08:34:42 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 22 Nov 2015 10:05:27 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 26 Jan 2020 10:49:07 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sat, 28 Nov 2020 15:19:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-01"}
