Massive O stars display a\nsimilar T_max, associated with a sharp rise in a line driven mass loss\nMdot_wind with increasing surface temperature. AGN AD are also characterized by\nsimilar surface gravity to massive O stars. The Mdot_wind of O stars reaches\n~10^-5 Msun/year. Since the surface area of AGN AD can be 10^6 larger, the\nimplied Mdot_wind in AGN AD can reach the accretion rate Mdot. A rise to\nMdot_wind Mdot towards the AD center may therefore set a similar cap of\nT_max~50,000K. To explore this idea, we solve the radial structure of an AD\nwith a mass loss term, and calculate the implied AD emission using the mass\nloss term derived from observations of O stars. We find that Mdot_wind becomes\ncomparable to Mdot typically at a few 10s of GM/c^2. Thus, the standard thin AD\nsolution is effectively truncated well outside the innermost stable orbit. The\ncalculated AD SED shows the observed turnover at lambda~1000A, which is weakly\ndependent on the AGN luminosity and black hole mass. The AD SED is generally\nindependent of the black hole spin, due to the large truncation radius.\nHowever, a cold AD (low Mdot, high black hole mass) is predicted to be\nwindless, and thus its SED should be sensitive to the black hole spin. The\naccreted gas may form a hot thick disc with a low radiative efficiency inside\nthe truncation radius, or a strong line driven outflow, depending on its\nionization state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Dec 2013 17:27:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 29 Dec 2013 15:52:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

The\nuse of loop quantum gravity techniques in the background space-time naturally\nregularizes the matter content, solving one of the main obstacles to back\nreaction calculations in more traditional treatments. The discreteness of area\nleads to modifications of the quantum vacua, eliminating the trans-Planckian\nmodes close to the horizon, which in turn eliminates all singularities from\nphysical quantities, like the expectation value of the stress energy tensor.\nApart from this, the Boulware, Hartle--Hawking and Unruh vacua differ little\nfrom the treatment on a classical space-time.

We show that the Hawking radiation can be computed,\nleading to an expression similar to the conventional one but with a high\nfrequency cutoff.

The field equations\nas well as the energy-momentum tensor are second order in the metric and the\nfield, therefore the theory belongs to the ones defined by Horndeski. We show\nthat in the presence of a cosmological term in the action, it is possible to\nhave a real scalar field in the region outside the event horizon. The solutions\nare characterized by a single integration constant, the scalar field vanishes\nat the horizon and it contributes to the effective cosmological constant at\ninfinity. We extend these results to the topological case. The solution is\ndisconnected from the maximally symmetric AdS background, however, within this\nfamily there exits a gravitational soliton which is everywhere regular. This\nsoliton is therefore used as a background to define a finite Euclidean action\nand to obtain the thermodynamics of the black holes. For a certain region in\nthe space of parameters, the thermodynamic analysis reveals a critical\ntemperature at which a Hawking-Page phase transition between the black hole and\nthe soliton occurs. We extend the solution to arbitrary dimensions grater than\nfour and show that the presence of a cosmological term in the action allows to\nconsider the case in which the standard kinetic term for the scalar it's not\npresent.

The inflaton is identified with a\nHiggs-like modulus whose the vacuum expectation value controls the\ngravitational strength. Thanks to a strong enough coupling (with a parameter cT\ninvolved) between the inflaton and the Ricci scalar curvature, inflation can be\nattained even for subplanckian values of the inflaton with cT>76 and the\ncorresponding effective theory being valid up to the Planck scale.

Excluding part of the orphan galaxies brings\nthe radial distributions of Millennium II satellites into better agreement with\nthe satellite distribution of Andromeda while still producing a significant\nfraction of planes with a lower rms than the VTPD. We also find haloes in\nMillennium II with an equal or higher number of co-rotating satellites than the\nVTPD. This demonstrates that the VTPD is not in conflict with the standard\ncosmological framework, although a definite answer of this question might\nrequire higher resolution cosmological simulations that do not have to consider\norphan galaxies.

When combining\nthis fact with the motivation from fundamental theory for shift-symmetric\nscalars (moduli) prior to SUSY breaking, this leads to a non-thermal history\nfor the early universe. Such a history implies different expectations for the\nmicroscopic properties of dark matter, as well as the possibility of dark\nradiation and a cosmic axion background. In this paper we examine how\ncorrelated and mixed isocurvature perturbations are generated in such models,\nas well as the connection to dark radiation. WMAP constraints on multiple\ncorrelated isocurvature modes allow up to half of the primordial perturbations\nto be isocurvature, contrary to the case of a single isocurvature mode where\nperturbations must be dominantly adiabatic. However, such bounds are strongly\nprior dependent, and have not been investigated with the latest Planck data. In\nthis paper we use the example of a SUSY non-thermal history to establish\ntheoretical priors on cosmological parameters. Of particular interest, we find\nthat priors on dark radiation are degenerate with those on the total amount of\nisocurvature -- they are inversely correlated. Dark radiation is tightly\nconstrained in the early universe and has been used recently to place stringent\nconstraints on string-based approaches to beyond the standard model.

Starting from the $N_c$ scaling of\nthe S-matrix elements, a relation between the total inelastic and total cross\nsections is derived for the regime in which the momenta are much larger than\nthe QCD scale. A conceptual complication arise from the fact that there is a\ntower of baryons, such as the $\\Delta$, with mass splittings from the nucleon\nwhich go to zero at large $N_c$. Since these baryons are stable at large $N_c$,\nthe meaning of elasticity must be modified.

We present a generalization of this method to arbitrary finite\ntemperature by making use of the full density matrix [Weichselbaum et al. Phys.\nRev. Lett. {\\bf 99}, 076402 (2007)].

The expression for $\\rho^{--}$ is shown to be finite\nat finite temperature, becoming negligible only in the limit of vanishing\ntemperatures. We prove that this approach recovers the short-time limit for the\nexpectation value of a local observable exactly at arbitrary temperatures. In\ncontrast, the corresponding long-time limit is only recovered exactly in the\nlimit $\\Lambda\\rightarrow 1^{+}$. This limit is impractical within NRG. We\nsuggest how to overcome this problem by noting that the long-time limit becomes\nincreasingly more accurate on reducing the size of the quantum quench. This\nsuggests an improved generalized td-NRG approach in which the system is\ntime-evolved between the initial and final states via a sequence of small\nquantum quenches within a finite time interval instead of a single large\nquantum quench. The formalism for this is provided, generalizing the td-NRG to\nmultiple quantum quenches, periodic switching, and general pulses. This\nformalism, like our finite temperature generalization of the single-quench\ncase, rests only on the NRG approximation.

The dynamics of such plasmas\nis dramatically different from a conventional MHD fluid. The plasma is expected\nto stay locally in a marginal state with respect to the instabilities, but how\nit does this is an open question. Two models of magnetic-field evolution are\ninvestigated. In the first, marginality is achieved via suppression of the rate\nof change of the field. In the second, the instabilities give rise to anomalous\ncollisionality, reducing pressure anisotropy to marginal - at the same time\ndecreasing viscosity and so increasing the turbulent rate of strain.\nImplications of these models are studied in a simplified 0D setting. In the\nfirst model, the field grows explosively but on a time scale that scales with\ninitial beta, while in the second, dynamical field strength can be reached in\none large-scale turbulence turn-over time regardless of the initial seed. Both\nmodels produce very intermittent fields. Both also suffer from strong\nconstraints on their applicability: for typical cluster-core conditions, scale\nseparation between the fluid motions and the microscale fluctuations breaks\ndown at beta~10^5-10^4. At larger beta (weaker fields), a fully collisionless\nplasma dynamo theory is needed in order to justify the growth of the field from\na tiny primordial seed.

Automatic tools are necessary to efficiently handle this\nmaterial. The measurement of equivalent widths in stellar spectra is\ntraditionally done by hand or with semi-automatic procedures that are\ntime-consuming and not very robust with respect to the repeatability of the\nresults. The program DAOSPEC is a tool that provides consistent measurements of\nequivalent widths in stellar spectra while requiring a minimum of user\nintervention. However, it is not optimised to deal with large batches of\nspectra, as some parameters still need to be modified and checked by the user.\nExploiting the versatility and portability of BASH, we have built a pipeline\ncalled DAOSPEC Option Optimiser (DOOp) automating the procedure of equivalent\nwidths measurement with DAOSPEC. DOOp is organised in different modules that\nrun one after the other to perform specific tasks, taking care of the\noptimisation of the parameters needed to provide the final equivalent widths,\nand providing log files to ensure better control over the procedure. In this\npaper, making use of synthetic and observed spectra, we compare the performance\nof DOOp with other methods, including DAOSPEC used manually. The measurements\nmade by DOOp are identical to the ones produced by DAOSPEC when used manually,\nwhile requiring less user intervention, which is convenient when dealing with a\nlarge quantity of spectra. DOOp shows its best performance on high-resolution\nspectra (R>20 000) and high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N>30), with uncertainties\nranging from 6 m{\\AA} to 2 m{\\AA}. The only subjective parameter that remains\nis the normalisation, as the user still has to make a choice on the order of\nthe polynomial used for the continuum fitting. As a test, we use the equivalent\nwidths measured by DOOp to re-derive the stellar parameters of four\nwell-studied stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Dec 2013 23:45:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

But to this day, obtaining the drag\nacting on the complicated shapes of modern spacecraft suffers from many sources\nof error. While part of the problem is the uncertain density in the upper\natmosphere, this works focuses on improving the modeling of interacting\nrarified gases and satellite surfaces. The only numerical approach that\ncurrently captures effects in this flow regime---like self-shadowing and\nmultiple molecular reflections---is known as test-particle Monte Carlo. This\nmethod executes a ray-tracing algorithm to follow particles that pass through a\ncontrol volume containing the spacecraft and accumulates the momentum transfer\nto the body surfaces. Statistical fluctuations inherent in the approach demand\nparticle numbers in the order of millions, often making this scheme too costly\nto be practical. This work presents a parallel test-particle Monte Carlo method\nthat takes advantage of both GPUs and multi-core CPUs. The speed at which this\nmodel can run with millions of particles allowed exploring a regime where a\nflaw in the model's initial particle seeding was revealed. Our new model\nintroduces an analytical fix based on seeding the calculation with an initial\ndistribution of particles at the boundary of a spherical control volume and\ncomputing the integral for the correct number flux. This work includes\nverification of the proposed model using analytical solutions for several\nsimple geometries and demonstrates uses for studying aero-stabilization of the\nPhobos-Grunt Martian probe and pose-estimation for the ICESat mission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Dec 2013 02:25:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-16"}

However,\nthe ultra fast phase transformations required for these applications can be\nexceedingly complex even for single component systems, and a full physical\nunderstanding of these phenomena is still lacking. In this paper we study\nnucleation and growth of crystalline Ge from amorphous thin films at high\ntemperature using phase field models informed by atomistic calculations of\nfundamental material properties. The atomistic calculations capture the full\nanisotropy of the Ge crystal lattice, which results in orientation dependences\nfor interfacial energies and mobilities.

By means of this multiscale approach, we study the interplay between\nnucleation and growth and find that the relation between the mean radius of the\ncrystallized Ge grains and the nucleation rate follows simple Avrami-type\nscaling laws.

In this work, we present a comparison of Coma to\nan X-ray selected control sample of clusters. We show that although Coma is\ntypical against the control sample in terms of its internal kinematics\n(substructure and velocity dispersion profile), it has a significantly high\n(~3sigma) X-ray temperature set against clusters of comparable mass. By\nde-redshifting our control sample cluster galaxies star-formation rates using a\nfit to the galaxy main sequence evolution at z < 0.1, we determine that the\ntypical star-formation rate of Coma galaxies as a function of mass is higher\nthan for galaxies in our control sample at a confidence level of > 99 per cent.\nOne way to alleviate this discrepency and bring Coma in-line with the control\nsample would be to have the distance to Coma to be slightly lower, perhaps\nthrough a non-negligible peculiar velocity with respect to the Hubble\nexpansion, but we do not regard this as likely given precision measurements\nusing a variety of approaches.

These measurements\nare able to resolve molecular bands into individual absorption lines. Observing\nmany lines simultaneously as their Doppler shift changes with time allows the\ndetection of specific molecules in the atmosphere of the exoplanet. We\nperformed simulations of high-resolution CRIRES observations of a planet's\nthermal emission and transit between 1-5 micron and performed a\ncross-correlation analysis on these results to assess how well the planet\nsignal can be extracted. We also simulated day-side and night-side spectra at\nhigh spectral resolution for planets with and without a day-side temperature\ninversion, based on the cases of HD 189733b and HD 209458b. Several small\nwavelength regions in the L-band promise to yield cross-correlation signals\nfrom the thermal emission of hot Jupiters that can exceed those of the current\ndetections by up to a factor of 2-3 for the same integration time. For transit\nobservations, the H-band is also attractive, with the H, K, and L-band giving\ncross-correlation signals of similar strength. High-resolution night-side\nspectra of hot Jupiters can give cross-correlation signals as high as the\nday-side, or even higher. We show that there are many new possibilities for\nhigh-resolution observations of exoplanet atmospheres that have expected planet\nsignals at least as high as those already detected. Hence, high-resolution\nobservations at well-chosen wavelengths and at different phases can improve our\nknowledge about hot Jupiter atmospheres significantly, already with currently\navailable instrumentation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Dec 2013 09:45:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

Nucleation of photochemically produced sulfuric acid\nonto polysulfur condensation nuclei generates mode 1 cloud droplets that then\ndiffuse upwards into the UH. Droplets generated in the UH from nucleation of\nsulfuric acid onto meteoric dust coagulate with the upwelled cloud particles\nand cannot reproduce the observed bimodal size distribution. The mass transport\nenabled by cloud top transient winds are able to generate a bimodal size\ndistribution in a time scale consistent with observations. Sedimentation and\nconvection in the middle and lower clouds causes the formation of large mode 2\nand mode 3 particles. Evaporation of these particles below the clouds creates a\nlocal sulfuric acid vapor maximum that causes upwelling of sulfuric acid back\ninto the clouds. If the polysulfur condensation nuclei are small and their\nproduction rate is high, coagulation of small droplets onto larger droplets in\nthe middle cloud may result in sulfuric acid \"rain\" below the clouds once every\nfew Earth months. Reduction of the polysulfur condensation nuclei production\nrate destroys this oscillation and reduces the mode 1 particle abundance in the\nmiddle cloud by two orders of magnitude, though it better reproduces the\nsulfur-to-sulfuric-acid mass ratio in the cloud and haze droplets. In general\nwe find satisfactory agreement between our results and observations, though\nimprovements could be made by incorporating sulfur microphysics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Dec 2013 09:52:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

Then the dual $G^*$ is a cubic\n3-connected planar graph, and $G^*$ is bipartite if and only if $G$ is\nEulerian. We prove that if the vertices of $G$ are (improperly) coloured blue\nand red, such that the blue vertices cover the faces of $G$, there is no blue\ncycle, and every red cycle contains a vertex of degree at most 4, then $G^*$ is\nHamiltonian.\n  This result implies the following special case of Barnette's Conjecture: if\n$G$ is an Eulerian planar triangulation, whose vertices are properly coloured\nblue, red and green, such that every red-green cycle contains a vertex of\ndegree 4, then $G^*$ is Hamiltonian.

However, both city population and urban area comply with the course\nof logistic growth rather than exponential growth. In this paper, I will\npresent a new allometric scaling based on logistic growth to solve the\nabovementioned problem. The logistic growth is a process of replacement\ndynamics.

The exponential allometric relation between urban area\nand population is the approximate expression of the logistic allometric\nequation when the city size is not large enough. The proper range of the\nallometric scaling exponent value is reconsidered through the logistic process.\nThen, a medium-sized city of Henan Province, China, is employed as an example\nto validate the new allometric relation.

In this work we assess the limits of shape\ncontributions to the reversal stability using micromagnetic simulations. In a\nfirst series of tests we altered the aspect ratio of single phase prolate\nspheroids from 1 to 16. Starting with a sphere of radius $4.3$ times the\nexchange length $ L_{\\mathrm{ex}}$ we kept the total magnetic volume constant\nas the aspect ratio was modified. For a ferromagnet with zero\nmagnetocrystalline anisotropy the maximum coercive field reached up to $0.5$\ntimes the magnetization $M_{\\mathrm{s}}$. Therefore, in materials with moderate\nuniaxial magnetocrystalline anisotropy, the addition of shape anisotropy could\neven double the coercive field. Interestingly due to non-uniform magnetization\nreversal there is no significant increase of the coercive field for an aspect\nratio greater than 5. A similar limit of the maximum aspect ratio was observed\nin cylinders. The coercive field depends on the wire diameter. By decreasing\nthe wire diameter from $8.7 L_{\\mathrm{ex}}$ to $2.2 L_{\\mathrm{ex}}$ the\ncoercive field increased by 40%. In the cylinders nucleation of a reversed\ndomain starts at the corners at the end. Smoothing the edges can improve the\ncoercive field by about 10%.\n  In further simulations we compacted soft magnetic cylinders into a bulk-like\narrangement. Misalignment and magnetostatic interactions cause a spread of $0.1\nM_{\\mathrm{s}}$ in the switching fields of the rods.

Even small errors in the correlation energy can\nhave a large impact on the description of chemical and physical properties in\nthe systems of interest. In this context, the development of efficient\napproaches for the accurate calculation of the long-range correlation energy\n(and hence dispersion) is the main challenge. In the last years a number of\nmethods have been developed to augment density functional approximations via\ndispersion energy corrections, but most of these approaches ignore the\nintrinsic many-body nature of correlation effects, leading to inconsistent and\nsometimes even qualitatively incorrect predictions. Here we build upon the\nrecent many-body dispersion (MBD) framework, which is intimately linked to the\nrandom-phase approximation for the correlation energy. We separate the\ncorrelation energy into short-range contributions that are modeled by\nsemi-local functionals and long-range contributions that are calculated by\nmapping the complex all-electron problem onto a set of atomic response\nfunctions coupled in the dipole approximation. We propose an effective\nrange-separation of the coupling between the atomic response functions that\nextends the already broad applicability of the MBD method to non-metallic\nmaterials with highly anisotropic responses, such as layered nanostructures.\nApplication to a variety of high-quality benchmark datasets illustrates the\naccuracy and applicability of the improved MBD approach, which offers the\nprospect of first-principles modeling of large structurally complex systems\nwith an accurate description of the long-range correlation energy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Dec 2013 13:33:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-05"}

Radial speeds within\nthe cavity might even have to approach free-fall values to explain the huge\nsurface density contrasts inferred for transition disks.
