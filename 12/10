These\nmodels are often high-dimensional and chaotic. An important goal in studying\nphysical systems through the lens of mathematical models is to determine when\nthe system undergoes changes in qualitative behavior. A detailed description of\nthe dynamics can be difficult or impossible to obtain for high-dimensional and\nchaotic systems. Therefore, a more sensible goal is to recognize and mark\ntransitions of a system between qualitatively different regimes of behavior. In\npractice, one is interested in developing techniques for detection of such\ntransitions from sparse observations, possibly contaminated by noise. In this\npaper we develop a framework to accurately tag different regimes of complex\nsystems based on topological features. In particular, our framework works with\na high degree of success in picking out a cyclically orbiting regime from a\nstationary equilibrium regime in high-dimensional stochastic dynamical systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Dec 2013 16:02:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 Mar 2014 14:33:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-25"}

These make the system bulk and complicated for the\nreflection-type measurement. In this paper, we propose a novel THz-TDS\nendoscope that is specifically designed for reflection-type measurement. This\nTHz-TDS endoscope is benefited from an integrated photoconductive antenna (we\ncall it iPCA), which integrates the emitter and receiver on a single antenna\nchip. Therefore, the dimension of the endoscope can be shrunk as much as\npossible for practical usage. We present the design and working principle of\nthis THz-TDS endoscope in details.

A\nnatural example for such geometry is the intermetallic layered material\nEuRh$_2$Si$_2$, in which magnetically active layers of Eu are well separated\nfrom each other by non-magnetic Si-Rh-Si trilayers. Applying angle-resolved\nphotoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES) to this system, we discovered a large spin\nsplitting of a Shockley-type surface state formed by itinerant electrons of the\nSi-Rh-Si surface related trilayer. ARPES shows that the splitting sets in below\napprox. 32.5K and quickly saturates to around 150meV upon cooling.\nInterestingly, this temperature is substantially higher than the order\ntemperature of the Eu 4f moments (approx. 24.5K) in the bulk.

Here we report that cycles of\nelectron capture and its inverse, $\\beta^-$ decay, involving neutron-rich\nnuclei at a typical depth of about 150 m, cool the outer neutron star crust by\nemitting neutrinos while also thermally decoupling the surface layers from the\ndeeper crust.

This thermal decoupling means that X-ray bursts\nand other surface phenomena are largely independent of the strength of deep\ncrustal heating. The unexpectedly short recurrence times, of the order of\nyears, observed for very energetic thermonuclear superbursts are therefore not\nan indicator of a hot crust, but may point instead to an unknown local heating\nmechanism near the neutron star surface.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Dec 2013 16:58:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-10"}

The corresponding form factors for the $B \\to K$ transitions\nhave been calculated in the Lattice-QCD approach for large-$q^2$ and\nextrapolated to the entire $q^2$-region using the so-called $z$-expansion.\nUsing an $SU(3)_F$-breaking Ansatz, we calculate the $B \\to \\pi$ tensor form\nfactor, which is consistent with the recently reported lattice $B \\to \\pi$\nanalysis obtained at large~$q^2$. The prediction for the total branching\nfraction ${\\cal B} (B^\\pm \\to \\pi^\\pm \\mu^+ \\mu^-) = (1.88 ^{+0.32}_{-0.21})\n\\times 10^{-8}$ is in good agreement with the experimental value obtained by\nthe LHCb Collaboration. In the low $q^2$-region, heavy-quark symmetry (HQS)\nrelates the three form factors with each other. Accounting for the\nleading-order symmetry-breaking effects, and using data from the\ncharged-current process $B \\to \\pi \\ell \\nu_\\ell$ to determine $f_+ (q^2)$, we\ncalculate the dilepton invariant-mass distribution in the low $q^2$-region in\nthe $B^\\pm \\to \\pi^\\pm \\ell^+ \\ell^-$ decay. This provides a model-independent\nand precise calculation of the partial branching ratio for this decay.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Dec 2013 17:38:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Apr 2014 14:12:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-28"}

With Stute's weighted least squares method, when the largest\nobservation is censored ($Y_{(n)}^+$), it is natural to apply the\nredistribution to the right algorithm of Efron (1967). However, Efron's\nredistribution algorithm can lead to bias and inefficiency in estimation. This\nstudy explains the issues clearly and proposes some alternative ways of\ntreating $Y_{(n)}^+$. The first four proposed approaches are based on the well\nknown Buckley--James (1979) method of imputation with the Efron's tail\ncorrection and the last approach is indirectly based on a general mean\nimputation technique in literature. All the new schemes use penalized weighted\nleast squares optimized by quadratic programming implemented with the\naccelerated failure time models. Furthermore, two novel additional imputation\napproaches are proposed to impute the tail tied censored observations that are\noften found in survival analysis with heavy censoring.

Breaking of this U(1) symmetry results in a massless Goldstone\nboson \\alpha and a massive CP-even scalar r, and splits the Dirac fermion into\ntwo new mass-eigenstates \\psi_\\pm, corresponding to Majorana fermions.

Simulation data are obtained using finite difference\ntime domain from a realistic sample. The bone mineral density of the samples\nare also measured. The simulation and experimental results of the present study\nsuggest that there is a negative relation between bone volume fraction (BV/TV)\nand permittivity (conductivity): the higher the BV/TV the lower the\npermittivity (conductivity).

The majority of algorithms to\ndate have been based on a second-quantized representation of the electronic\nstructure Hamiltonian - necessitating qubit requirements that scale linearly\nwith the number of orbitals. The scaling of the number of gates for such\nmethods, while polynomial, presents some serious experimental challenges.\nHowever, because the number of electrons is a good quantum number for the\nelectronic structure problem it is unnecessary to store the full Fock space of\nthe orbitals. Representation of the wave function in a basis of Slater\ndeterminants for fixed electron number suffices. However, to date techniques\nfor the quantum simulation of the Hamiltonian represented in this basis - the\nCI-matrix - have been lacking. We show how to apply techniques developed for\nthe simulation of sparse Hamiltonians to the CI-matrix. We prove a number of\nresults exploiting the structure of the CI-matrix, arising from the Slater\nrules which define it, to improve the application of sparse Hamiltonian\nsimulation techniques in this case. We show that it is possible to use the\nminimal number of qubits to represent the wavefunction, and that these methods\ncan offer improved scaling in the number of gates required in the limit of\nfixed electron number and increasing basis set size relevant for high-accuracy\ncalculations.

Angular momentum redistribution\nvia hydrodynamical shocks leads to inflows of gas across the inner boundary,\nenhancing the inflow rate by more than 2-3 orders of magnitude. In all cases,\nthe gas inflow rate across the inner parsec is higher than in the absence of\nthe interaction, and the orientation of the angular momentum of the flow in the\nregion changes with time due to gas mixing. Warped discs or nested misaligned\nrings form depending on the angular momentum content of the infalling shell\nrelative to the disc.

The resulting cosmologies are studied using\nboth dynamical system analysis and numerics. From the dynamical system point of\nview, one free parameter controls the cosmological dynamics, given by the ratio\nof the warp factor and the potential energy scales. The disformal coupling\nallows for new scaling solutions that can describe accelerating cosmologies\nalleviating the coincidence problem of dark energy. In addition, this scenario\nmay ameliorate the fine-tuning problem of dark energy, whose small value may be\nattained dynamically, without requiring the mass of the dark energy field to be\nunnaturally low.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Dec 2013 21:07:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 27 May 2014 11:37:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

Nodes request files\nat random. If the requested file is not in the on-board cache, then it is\ndownloaded from some neighboring node via one-hop \"local\" communication. An\noutage event occurs when a requested file is not found in the neighborhood of\nthe requesting node, or if the network admission control policy decides not to\nserve the request. We characterize the optimal throughput-outage tradeoff in\nterms of tight scaling laws for various regimes of the system parameters, when\nboth the number of nodes and the number of files in the library grow to\ninfinity. Our analysis is based on Gupta and Kumar {\\em protocol model} for the\nunderlying D2D wireless network, widely used in the literature on capacity\nscaling laws of wireless networks without caching. Our results show that the\ncombination of D2D spectrum reuse and caching at the user nodes yields a\nper-user throughput independent of the number of users, for any fixed outage\nprobability in $(0,1)$. This implies that the D2D caching network is\n\"scalable\": even though the number of users increases, each user achieves\nconstant throughput. This behavior is very different from the classical Gupta\nand Kumar result on ad-hoc wireless networks, for which the per-user throughput\nvanishes as the number of users increases. Furthermore, we show that the user\nthroughput is directly proportional to the fraction of cached information over\nthe whole file library size. Therefore, we can conclude that D2D caching\nnetworks can turn \"memory\" into \"bandwidth\" (i.e., doubling the on-board cache\nmemory on the user devices yields a 100\\% increase of the user throughout).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Dec 2013 01:04:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Jul 2015 18:56:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-29"}

Answering this question leads to the\ngeneration of a combinatorial set of lattice configurations. This set defines\nthe \\textit{configuration space} of the problem, and the smaller it is, the\nfaster the transfer matrix method can be. The configuration space of generic\ntransfer matrix methods for strip lattices in the Potts model is in the order\nof the Catalan numbers, leading to an asymptotic cost of $O(4^m)$ with $m$\nbeing the width of the strip. Transfer matrix methods with a smaller\nconfiguration space indeed exist but they make assumptions on the temperature,\nnumber of spin states, or restrict the topology of the lattice in order to\nwork. In this paper we propose a general and parallel transfer matrix method,\nbased on family trees, that uses a sub-Catalan configuration space of size\n$O(3^m)$. The improvement is achieved by grouping the original set of Catalan\nconfigurations into a forest of family trees, in such a way that the solution\nto the problem is now computed by just solving the root node of each family.

In particular, we investigate\nachievability techniques based on either decomposition with asymptotic\ninterference alignment (IA) or linear beamforming schemes, and show that there\nare distinct regimes of (G,K,M,N) where one outperforms the other. We first\nnote that both one-sided and two-sided decomposition with asymptotic IA achieve\nthe same degrees of freedom. We then establish specific antenna configurations\nunder which the DoF achieved using decomposition based schemes is optimal by\nderiving a set of outer bounds on the symmetric DoF. For linear beamforming\nschemes, we first focus on small networks and propose a structured approach to\nlinear beamforming based on a notion called packing ratios. Packing ratio\ndescribes the interference footprint or shadow cast by a set of transmit\nbeamformers and enables us to identify the underlying structures for aligning\ninterference. Such a structured beamforming design can be shown to achieve the\noptimal spatially normalized DoF (sDoF) of two-cell two-user/cell network and\nthe two-cell three-user/cell network. For larger networks, we develop an\nunstructured approach to linear interference alignment, where transmit\nbeamformers are designed to satisfy conditions for IA without explicitly\nidentifying the underlying structures for IA. The main numerical insight of\nthis paper is that such an approach appears to be capable of achieving the\noptimal sDoF for MIMO cellular networks in regimes where linear beamforming\ndominates asymptotic decomposition, and a significant portion of sDoF\nelsewhere. Remarkably, polynomial identity test appears to play a key role in\nidentifying the boundary of the achievable sDoF region in the former case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Dec 2013 06:38:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-11"}

Here\nwe present a Bayesian hierarchical model to estimate the joint distribution of\nearth structural and earthquake source parameters. An ellipsoidal spatial prior\nallows to accommodate the layered nature of the earth's mantle. With our\nefficient algorithm we can sample the posterior distributions for large-scale\nlinear inverse problems and provide precise uncertainty quantification in terms\nof parameter distributions and credible intervals given the data. We apply the\nmethod to a full-fledged tomography problem, an inversion for upper-mantle\nstructure under western North America that involves more than 11,000\nparameters. In studies on simulated and real data, we show that our approach\nretrieves the major structures of the earth's interior as well as classical\nleast-squares minimization, while additionally providing uncertainty\nassessments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Dec 2013 06:52:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-11"}

In this paper, we propose to\nassociate contracts to transactions and we define a program transformation that\nmakes it possible to extend static contract checking in the context of STM\nHaskell. As a result, we are able to check statically that each transaction of\na STM Haskell program handles the shared data in a such way that a given\nconsistency property, expressed in the form of a user-defined boolean function,\nis preserved. This ensures that bad interference will not occur during the\nexecution of the concurrent program.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Dec 2013 08:04:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-11"}

The\nprevailing fundamental question would be how these two mechanisms contrive to\naccomplish emergent anomalous behaviors. Here, we have grown high quality\nperovskite SrIrO3 thin films, containing a strong spin orbit coupled 5d element\nIr, on various substrates such as GdScO3 (110), DyScO3 (110), SrTiO3 (001), and\nNdGaO3 (110) with increasing lattice mismatch, in order to carry out a\nsystematic study on the transport properties. We found that metal insulator\ntransitions can be induced in this system; by either reducing thickness (on\nbest lattice matched substrate) or changing degree of lattice strain (by\nlattice mismatch between film and substrates) of films. Surprisingly these two\npathways seek two distinct types of metal insulator transitions; the former\nfalls into disorder driven Anderson type whereas the latter turns out to be of\nunconventional Mott-Anderson type with the interplay of disorder and\ncorrelation. More interestingly, in the metallic phases of SrIrO3, unusual\nnon-Fermi liquid characteristics emerge in resistivity as the resistivity\nexponent evolves from from 4/5 to 1 to 3/2 with increasing lattice strain.

In both pulsars the emission bursts\nappear in a quasi-periodic fashion with typical separations of several hundred\npulses, and in J1738-2330 there is evidence of two underlying periodicities\nwith memory persisting for at least 11 bursts. By contrast, in J1752+2359 the\npattern coherence is rapidly lost and the burst/null lengths appear to be\nselected randomly from their respective quasi-normal distributions. The typical\nemission bursts of J1738-2330 exhibit a steady exponential decay of on-pulse\nenergy accompanied by a flickering emission characterized by short frequent\nnulls towards their end. In the bursts of J1752+2359 the flickering is absent,\nthe decay more pronounced and the energy released during each bright phase is\napproximately constant. Unlike J1738-2330, the average profiles for the first\nand the last pulses of J1752+2359 bursts differ slightly from the pulsar's\noverall profile, hinting at differences between the two pulsars in their\ntransitions from null to burst state (and vice-versa). During its long null\nphases, J1752+2359 is found to emit random weak inter-burst pulses (IBPs) whose\nprofile peak is somewhat offset with respect to the overall average profile.\nSuch pulses have no equivalent in J1738-2330 or in any known pulsar hitherto.\nThey may pervade the entire emission of this pulsar and have a separate\nphysical origin to normal pulses. On the basis of our comparison we conclude\nthat a pulsar's nulling fraction, even when high, remains a poor guide to its\ndetailed subpulse behaviour, as previously found for pulsars with small nulling\nfractions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Dec 2013 09:49:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-05"}

A cut (B,W) of G (a bipartition of V(G)) separates\na clique K and a stable set S if $K\\subseteq B$ and $S\\subseteq W$. A\nClique-Stable Set Separator is a family of cuts such that for every clique K,\nand for every stable set S disjoint from K, there exists a cut in the family\nthat separates K and S. Given a class of graphs, the question is to know\nwhether every graph of the class admits a Clique-Stable Set Separator\ncontaining only polynomially many cuts. It is open for the class of all graphs,\nand also for perfect graphs, which was Yannakakis' original question. Here we\ninvestigate on perfect graphs with no balanced skew-partition; the balanced\nskew-partition was introduced in the proof of the Strong Perfect Graph Theorem.\nRecently, Chudnovsky, Trotignon, Trunck and Vuskovic proved that forbidding\nthis unfriendly decomposition permits to recursively decompose Berge graphs\nusing 2-join and complement 2-join until reaching a basic graph, and they found\nan efficient combinatorial algorithm to color those graphs. We apply their\ndecomposition result to prove that perfect graphs with no balanced\nskew-partition admit a quadratic-size Clique-Stable Set Separator, by taking\nadvantage of the good behavior of 2-join with respect to this property. We then\ngeneralize this result and prove that the Strong Erdos-Hajnal property holds in\nthis class, which means that every such graph has a linear-size biclique or\ncomplement biclique. This property does not hold for all perfect graphs (Fox\n2006), and moreover when the Strong Erdos-Hajnal property holds in a hereditary\nclass of graphs, then both the Erdos-Hajnal property and the polynomial\nClique-Stable Set Separation hold.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Dec 2013 09:52:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Jun 2015 10:41:34 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 15 Feb 2016 09:55:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-17"}

Recent\nmultiwavelength observations of Galactic black hole transients show that the\nsituation is not so simple. Fast variability in the OIR band, OIR excesses\nabove the thermal emission and a complicated interplay between the X-ray and\nthe OIR light curves imply that the OIR emitting region is much more compact.\nOne of the popular hypotheses is that the jet contributes to the OIR emission\nand even is responsible for the bulk of the X-rays. However, this scenario is\nlargely ad hoc and is in contradiction with many previously established facts.\nAlternatively, the hot accretion flow, known to be consistent with the X-ray\nspectral and timing data, is also a viable candidate to produce the OIR\nradiation. The hot-flow scenario naturally explains the power-law like OIR\nspectra, fast OIR variability and its complex relation to the X-rays if the hot\nflow contains non-thermal electrons (even in energetically negligible\nquantities), which are required by the presence of the MeV tail in Cyg X-1. The\npresence of non-thermal electrons also lowers the equilibrium electron\ntemperature in the hot flow model to <100 keV, making it more consistent with\nobservations. Here we argue that any viable model should simultaneously explain\na large set of spectral and timing data and show that the hybrid\n(thermal/non-thermal) hot flow model satisfies most of the constraints.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Dec 2013 11:28:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-24"}

It is found that the\neccentricity of the contact area decreases during tensile loading and for cases\nwhen the point load solution can be accurately described by only one Fourier\nterm, it is almost circular at pull-off, permitting an exact closed form\nsolution for this case. As in the isotropic JKR solution, the pull-off force is\nindependent of the mean elastic modulus, but we find that anisotropy increases\nthe pull-off force and this effect can be quite significant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Dec 2013 12:26:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

We invert the Stokes profiles of the\nchromospheric He I 10830 A triplet and the photospheric Si I 10827 A line\nobserved in this filament by the VTT on Tenerife. Using these inversion results\nwe present and interpret the first maps of velocity and magnetic field obtained\nin an activated filament, both in the photosphere and the chromosphere. Up to 5\ndifferent magnetic components are found in the chromospheric layers of the\nfilament, while outside the filament a single component is sufficient to\nreproduce the observations. Magnetic components displaying an upflow are\npreferentially located towards the centre of the filament, while the downflows\nare concentrated along its periphery. Also, the upflowing gas is associated\nwith an opposite-polarity magnetic configuration with respect to the\nphotosphere, while the downflowing gas is associated with a same-polarity\nconfiguration. The activated filament has a rather complex structure.\nNonetheless, it is compatible with a flux rope, although with a distorted one,\nin the normal configuration. The observations are best explained by a rising\nflux rope in which a part of the filament material is still stably stored\n(upflowing material, rising with the field), while a part is no longer stably\nstored and flows down along the field lines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Dec 2013 12:30:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

We introduce quenched matter in the fundamental, modelled by\nprobe D7-branes which wrap an internal three-dimensional manifold and lie at\nthe equator of the transverse two-sphere.

Results: In the absence of partner treatment,\nthe medians of the expected re-infection probabilities are 19.4% (interquartile\nrange (IQR) 9.2-31.6%) for chlamydia and 12.5% (IQR 5.6-22.2%) for gonorrhoea.\nIf all current partners receive treatment three days after the index case, the\nexpected re-infection probabilities are 4.2% (IQR 2.1-6.9%) for chlamydia and\n5.5% (IQR 2.6-9.5%) for gonorrhoea.

The interesting feature of this model is of course that\nthe entropy density remains finite as $T \\rightarrow 0$ while the bulk geometry\ndevelops an infinite throat. This leads to a logarithmic divergence in the\nscale required for non-zero mutual information between equal-sized strips in\nthe two CFTs, though the mutual information between one entire CFT and a\nfinite-sized strip in the other can remain non-zero even at $T=0$. Furthermore,\ndespite the infinite throat, there can be extremally charged operators for\nwhich the two-point correlations remain finite as $T \\rightarrow 0$. This\nsuggests an interestingly mixed picture in which some aspects of the\nentanglement remain localized on scales set by the chemical potential, while\nothers shift to larger and larger scales. We also comment on implications for\nthe localized-quasiparticle picture of entanglement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Dec 2013 15:48:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-14"}
