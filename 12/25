We address a direct comparison between the\nLangevin dynamics and the Boltzmann collisional integral (BM) when a bulk\nmedium is in equilibrium at fixed temperature. We show that unless the cross\nsection is quite forward peaked ($m_D\\cong T $) or the mass to temperature\nratio is quite large ($M_{HQ}/T \\gtrsim 8-10$) there are significant\ndifferences in the evolution of the $p-$spectra and consequently on nuclear\nmodification factor $R_{AA}(p_T)$.

Studying\nalso the momentum spread suffered by a single heavy quarks we see that at\ntemperatures $T\\gtrsim \\, 250\\,\\rm MeV$ the dynamics of the scatterings is far\nfrom being of Brownian type for charm quarks. In the case of bottom quarks we\nessentially find no differences in the time evolution of the momentum spectra\nbetween the LV and the BM dynamics independently of the angular dependence of\nthe cross section, at least in the range of temperature relevant for\nultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions.

In all these bodies, the tropopause separates a\nstratosphere with a temperature profile that is controlled by the absorption of\nshortwave solar radiation, from a region below characterised by convection,\nweather, and clouds. However, it is not obvious why the tropopause occurs at\nthe specific pressure near 0.1 bar. Here we use a physically-based model to\ndemonstrate that, at atmospheric pressures lower than 0.1 bar, transparency to\nthermal radiation allows shortwave heating to dominate, creating a\nstratosphere. At higher pressures, atmospheres become opaque to thermal\nradiation, causing temperatures to increase with depth and convection to ensue.\nA common dependence of infrared opacity on pressure, arising from the shared\nphysics of molecular absorption, sets the 0.1 bar tropopause. We hypothesize\nthat a tropopause at a pressure of approximately 0.1 bar is characteristic of\nmany thick atmospheres, including exoplanets and exomoons in our galaxy and\nbeyond.

In this model there are two scalar leptoquarks\naccommodated in an $SU_L(2)\\times U_Y(1)$ doublet: one of such leptoquarks is\nnon-chiral and has electric charge of $5/3e$, whereas the other one is chiral\nand has electric charge $2/3e$. In particular, a non-chiral leptoquark\ncontributes to the weak properties of an up fermion via a chirality\nflipping-term proportional to the mass of the virtual fermion and can also\ninduce a non-zero weak electric dipole moment provided that the leptoquark\ncouplings are complex. The numerical analysis is focused on the weak properties\nof the $\\tau$ lepton since they offer good prospects for their experimental\nstudy. The constraints on leptoquark couplings are briefly discussed for a\nnon-chiral leptoquark with non diagonal couplings to the second and third\nfermion generations, a third-generation non-chiral leptoquark, and a\nthird-generation chiral leptoquark. It is found that although the\nchirality-flipping term can enhance the weak properties of the $\\tau$ lepton\nvia the top quark contribution, such an enhancement would be offset by the\nstrong constraints on the leptoquark couplings. So, the contribution of scalar\nleptoquarks to the weak magnetic dipole moment of the $\\tau$ lepton are smaller\nthan the standard model (SM) contributions but can be of similar size than\nthose arising in some SM extensions. A non-chiral leptoquark can also give\ncontributions to the weak electric dipole moment larger than the SM one but\nwell below the experimental limit.

In the case\nwhere the dust to gas ratio is enhanced and turbulence is week, the instability\ngrows, even in gravitationally stable disks, on a timescale of order $10^{4-\n5}$yr at a radius of order 100AU. If we ignore the dynamical feedback from dust\ngrains in the gas equation of motion, the instability reduces to the so-called\n\"secular gravitational instability\", which was investigated previously as an\ninstability of dust in a fixed background gas flow. In this work, we solve the\nequations of motion for both gas and dust consistently and find that\nlong-wavelength perturbations are stable, in contrast to the secular\ngravitational instability in the simplified treatment. This may indicate that\nwe should not neglect small terms in equation of motion if the growth rate is\nsmall. The instability is expected to form ring structures in protoplanetary\ndisks. The width of the ring formed at a radius of 100 AU is a few tens of AU.\nTherefore, the instability is a candidate for the formation mechanism of\nobserved ring-like structures in disks. Another aspect of the instability is\nthe accumulation of dust grains, and hence the instability may play an\nimportant role in the formation of planetesimals, rocky protoplanets, and cores\nof gas giants located at radii $\\sim$100 AU.

To this end, we study the behaviour of certain extremal\nsurfaces (focusing on those relevant for equal-time correlators and\nentanglement entropy in the dual CFT) in a dynamically evolving asymptotically\nAdS spacetime, specifically examining how deep such probes reach. To highlight\nthe novel effects of putting the system far out of equilibrium and at finite\nvolume, we consider spherically symmetric Vaidya-AdS, describing black hole\nformation by gravitational collapse of a null shell, which provides a\nconvenient toy model of a quantum quench in the field theory. Extremal surfaces\nanchored on the boundary exhibit rather rich behaviour, whose features depend\non dimension of both the spacetime and the surface, as well as on the anchoring\nregion. The main common feature is that they reach inside the horizon even in\nthe post-collapse part of the geometry. In 3-dimensional spacetime, we find\nthat for sub-AdS-sized black holes, the entire spacetime is accessible by the\nrestricted class of geodesics whereas in larger black holes a small region near\nthe imploding shell cannot be reached by any boundary-anchored geodesic. In\nhigher dimensions, the deepest reach is attained by geodesics which (despite\nbeing asymmetric) connect equal time and antipodal boundary points soon after\nthe collapse; these can attain spacetime regions of arbitrarily high curvature\nand simultaneously have smallest length. Higher-dimensional surfaces can\npenetrate the horizon while anchored on the boundary at arbitrarily late times,\nbut are bounded away from the singularity. We also study the details of length\nor area growth during thermalization. While the area of extremal surfaces\nincreases monotonically, geodesic length is neither monotonic nor continuous.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Dec 2013 20:44:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 3 Jan 2014 18:44:05 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 29 Mar 2014 12:36:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

The ability to fabricate\nmetamaterials has sparked an interest in determining possible applications. We\ninvestigate using a metamaterial for boundary engineering in waveguides.\n  A metamaterial-clad cylindrical waveguide is used to provide confinement for\nan optical signal, thereby increasing the local electromagnetic energy density.\nWe show that metamaterial-clad waveguides have unique optical properties,\nincluding new modes, which we call hybrid modes. These modes have properties of\nboth ordinary guided modes and surface plasmon-polariton modes.\n  We show that for certain metamaterial parameters, the surface\nplasmon-polariton modes of a metamaterial-clad waveguide have less propagation\nloss than those of a metal-clad guide with the same permittivity.

Working with the Zeldovitch-von Neumann-D\\\"oring (ZND)\nmodel, he identified two fundamental classes of detonation profiles, referred\nto as those of decreasing (D) and increasing (I) type, which appeared to\nexhibit very different behavior with respect to high-frequency perturbations.\nUsing a combination of rigorous and non-rigorous arguments, Erpenbeck concluded\nthat type I detonations were unstable to some oscillatory perturbations for\nwhich the (vector) frequency was of arbitrarily large magnitude, while type D\ndetonations were stable provided the frequency magnitude was sufficiently high.\nFor type D detonations Erpenbeck's methods did not allow him to obtain a cutoff\nmagnitude for stability that was \\emph{uniform} with respect to frequency\ndirection. Thus, he left open the question whether the cutoff magnitude for\nstability might approach $+\\infty$ as certain frequency directions were\napproached. In this paper we show by quite different methods that for type D\ndetonations there exists a uniform cutoff magnitude for stability independent\nof frequency direction. By reducing the search for unstable frequencies to a\nbounded frequency set, the uniform cutoff obtained here is a key step toward\nthe rigorous validation of a number of results in the computational detonation\nliterature.

In this work, a collection of commercially available glass\nsamples were measured with a variety of Si cantilevers coated with different\nconductive metals. In some cases, these glasses showed significant hysteresis\nloops, similar in appearance to those measured on ferroelectric materials with\nspontaneous permanent electric dipoles. The magnitude of the electrochemical\nstrain and hysteresis correlated well with the molar percentage of sodium in\nthe glass material, with high sodium (soda-lime) glass showing large hysteresis\nand fused silica (pure SiO2) showing essentially no hysteresis.

A systematic classification methodology is\npresented by using a sampling-based learning control (SLC) approach for quantum\ndiscrimination. The classification task is accomplished via simultaneously\nsteering members belonging to different classes to their corresponding target\nstates (e.g., mutually orthogonal states). Firstly a new discrimination method\nis proposed for two similar quantum systems. Then an SLC method is presented\nfor quantum ensemble classification.

OFDM\nsignaling can obviate the need for tight time synchronization among multiple\nsimultaneous transmissions in the uplink of PNC systems. However, OFDM PNC\nsystems are susceptible to phase drifts caused by residual carrier frequency\noffsets (CFOs). In the traditional OFDM system in which a receiver receives\nfrom only one transmitter, pilot tones are employed to aid phase tracking. In\nOFDM PNC systems, multiple transmitters transmit to a receiver, and these pilot\ntones must be shared among the multiple transmitters. This reduces the number\nof pilots that can be used by each transmitting node. Phase tracking in OFDM\nPNC is more challenging as a result. To overcome the degradation due to the\nreduced number of per-node pilots, this work supplements the pilots with the\nchannel information contained in the data. In particular, we propose to solve\nthe problems of phase tracking and channel decoding jointly. Our solution\nconsists of the use of the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for phase\ntracking and the use of the belief propagation (BP) algorithm for channel\ndecoding. The two problems are solved jointly through iterative processing\nbetween the EM and BP algorithms. Simulations and real experiments based on\nsoftware-defined radio show that the proposed method can improve phase tracking\nas well as channel decoding performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Dec 2013 10:48:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-30"}

In this paper, the problem of activity recognition is analyzed through\nthe segmentation of the multidimensional time series of the acceleration data\nmeasured in the 3-d space using body-worn accelerometers. The proposed model\nfor automatic temporal segmentation is a specific statistical latent process\nmodel which assumes that the observed acceleration sequence is governed by\nsequence of hidden (unobserved) activities. More specifically, the proposed\napproach is based on a specific multiple regression model incorporating a\nhidden discrete logistic process which governs the switching from one activity\nto another over time. The model is learned in an unsupervised context by\nmaximizing the observed-data log-likelihood via a dedicated\nexpectation-maximization (EM) algorithm.

If protein structure\nhomologues are not found, one has to construct 3D structural conformations from\nthe very beginning by the so-called ab initio approach, using some empirical\nenergy functions. A successful algorithm in this category, Rosetta, creates an\nensemble of decoy conformations by assembling selected best short fragments of\nknown protein structures and then recognizes the native state as the highly\npopulated one with a very low energy. Typically, an energy function is a\ncombination of a variety of terms characterizing different structural features,\nsay hydrophobic interactions, van der Waals force, hydrogen bonding, etc. It is\ncritical for an energy function to be capable to distinguish native-like\nconformations from non-native ones and to drive most initial conformations\nassembled from fragments to a native-like one in a conformation search process.\nIn this paper we propose a linear programming algorithm to optimize weighting\nof a total of 14 energy terms used in Rosetta. We reverse the Monte Carlo\nprocess of Rosetta to approach native-like conformations to a process\ngenerating from the native state an ensemble of initial conformations most\nrelevant to the native state.

Recently, fuelled by the\nfast development in the fields of metamaterials and plasmonics, artificial\noptically-induced magnetic responses have been demonstrated for various\nnanostructures. This kind of response can be employed to provide an extra\ndegree of freedom for the efficient control and shaping of the scattering\npatterns of nanoparticles and nanoantennas. Here we review the recent progress\nin this research direction of nanoparticle scattering shaping and control\nthrough the interference of both electric and optically-induced magnetic\nresponses. We discuss the magnetic resonances supported by various structures\nin different spectral regimes, and then summarize the original results on the\nscattering shaping involving both electric and magnetic responses, based on the\ninterference of both spectrally separated (with different resonant wavelengths)\nand overlapped dipoles (with the same resonant wavelength), and also other\nhigher-order modes. Finally, we discuss the scattering control utilizing Fano\nresonances associated with the magnetic responses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Dec 2013 15:15:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-05"}

We construct the effective\nHamiltonian for the conduction band using the L\\\"{o}wdin partition method from\nthe anisotropic two-band Hamiltonian with the intrinsic spin-orbit coupling of\nthe conduction band included. The spin-orbit coupling of the conduction band\ninduces the intra- and inter-valley D'yakonov-Perel' spin relaxation. In\naddition, the Elliot-Yafet spin relaxation also takes place due to the\ninterband spin mixing. We find that the D'yakonov-Perel' mechanism dominates\nthe in-plane spin relaxation. In the framework of this mechanism, the\nintravalley process is shown to play a more important role at low temperature\nwhereas the intervalley one becomes more important at high temperature. At the\ntemperature in between, the leading process of the in-plane spin relaxation\nchanges from the intervalley to intravalley one as the electron density\nincreases. Moreover, we find that the intravalley process is dominated by the\nelectron-electron Coulomb scattering even with high impurity density since the\ndominant term in the spin-orbit coupling is isotropic, which does not lead to\nthe spin relaxation together with the electron-impurity scattering. This is\nvery different from the previous studies in semiconductors and graphene.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Dec 2013 15:42:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-06"}

Based on the analysis of the grand\npotential within the self-consistent field approximation, we find that the\nformation of the polarized state strongly differs from the Bloch or Stoner\ntransition in homogeneous interacting systems. The main difference is that a\nmetastable state appears in the critical point in addition to the globally\nstable state, so that when the interaction parameter exceeds a critical value,\ntwo states coexist. One state has spin polarization and the other is\nunpolarized. Another feature is that the spin polarization increases\ncontinuously with the interaction parameter and has a square-root singularity\nin the critical point.
