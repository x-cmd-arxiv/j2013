However, least-squares approximations tend to be noisy in\nhigh-dimensional settings, and may not be appropriate for arrays that include\ndiscrete or ordinal measurements. This article develops methodology to obtain\nlow-rank model-based representations of continuous, discrete and ordinal data\narrays. The model is based on a parameterization of the mean array as a\nmultilinear product of a reduced-rank core array and a set of index-specific\northogonal eigenvector matrices. It is shown how orthogonally equivariant\nparameter estimates can be obtained from Bayesian procedures under invariant\nprior distributions. Additionally, priors on the core array are developed that\nact as regularizers, leading to improved inference over the standard\nleast-squares estimator, and providing robustness to misspecification of the\narray rank. This model-based approach is extended to accommodate discrete or\nordinal data arrays using a semiparametric transformation model. The resulting\nlow-rank representation is scale-free, in the sense that it is invariant to\nmonotonic transformations of the data array. In an example analysis of a\nmultivariate discrete network dataset, this scale-free approach provides a more\ncomplete description of data patterns.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Dec 2013 16:01:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-24"}

The shape of the baseline region and the\nsmoothness of the regression function at its boundary play a critical role in\ndetermining the rate of convergence of our estimate: for a regression function\nwhich is `p-regular' at the boundary of the convex baseline region, our\nestimate converges at a rate $N^{2/(4p+3)}$ in the dose-response setting, $N$\nbeing the total budget, and its analogue in the standard regression setting\nconverges at a rate of $N^{1/(2p+2)}$. Extensions to non-convex baseline\nregions are explored as well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Dec 2013 18:35:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-24"}

For this sake we calculate the viscosities in the RTA using cross sections\nextracted from the ultrarelativistic quantum molecular dynamics (UrQMD) model\nand compare them with the same ones calculated without the RTA. This allows us\nto find the estimates of errors due to the application of RTA in the\ncalculations of the viscosities, which are valid also for other similar models.\nFor instance, in the temperature region $100 MeV \\lesssim T \\lesssim 160 MeV$\nat zero chemical potentials the shear viscosity becomes smaller up to $1.57$\ntimes, or up to $1.45$ times if the averaged relaxation time is used. This has\nimportant consequences for interpretation of the previously made calculations\nof the viscosities and some other related calculations.

Using this approach one can solve\nproblems in which the domain under analysis can be selectively discretized\nspatially and temporally, hence allowing the user to obtain a desired level of\naccuracy in critical regions while improving computational efficiency globally.\nThe mathematical background for this approach is largely based upon the\nfundamental principles of domain decomposition methods (DDM) and Lagrange\nmultipliers, used to obtain coupled equations of motion for distinct regions of\na continuous domain. These methods when combined together systematically yield\nconstraint forces that not only ensure conservation of energy but also enforce\ncontinuity of velocities across sub-domain interfaces. Multiple grid (MG)\nconnections between non-conforming sub-domains are modeled using mortar\nelements whereas coupled multiple time-scale (MT) equations are derived for the\nclassical Newmark integration algorithm (and its constituents). Fully\ndiscretized equations of motion for component sub-domains, augmented with an\ninterface condition are then solved using block elimination method and Crout\nfactorization.\n  A proof of stability is provided using Energy method and overall efficiency,\naccuracy and stability of multiple sub-domain coupling is evaluated using a\nseries of numerical examples.

This goal is\nachieved by taking advantage of the channel noise and without requiring a\nshared key. The model has attracted attention in recent years because it\ncaptures eavesdropping attack in wireless communication. The wiretap adversary\nis a passive eavesdropping adversary at the physical layer of communication. In\nthis paper we propose a model for adversarial wiretap (AWTP) channel that\nmodels active adversaries at this layer. We consider a $(\\rho_r, \\rho_w)$\nwiretap adversary who can see a fraction $\\rho_r$, and modify a fraction\n$\\rho_w$, of the sent codeword. The code components that are read and/or\nmodified can be chosen adaptively, and the subsets of read and modified\ncomponents in general, can be different. AWTP codes provide secrecy and\nreliability for communication over these channels. We give security and\nreliability definitions and measures for these codes, and define secrecy\ncapacity of an AWTP channel that represents the secrecy potential of the\nchannel. The paper has two main contributions. First, we prove a tight upper\nbound on the rate of AWTP codes with perfect secrecy for $(\\rho_r,\n\\rho_w)$-AWTP channels, and use the bound to derive the secrecy capacity of the\nchannel. We prove a similar bound for $\\epsilon$-secure codes also, but in this\ncase the bound is not tight. Second, we give an explicit construction for a\ncapacity achieving AWTP code family, and prove its security and efficiency\nproperties. We show that AWTP model is a natural generalization of Wyner's\nwiretap models and somewhat surprisingly, also provides a direct generalization\nfor a seemingly unrelated cryptographic primitive, Secure Message Transmission\n(SMT).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Dec 2013 02:51:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Sep 2014 04:34:02 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 3 Sep 2014 21:05:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-05"}

The existing approaches to wind\npower forecasting are subsequently described, with focus on single-valued\npredictions, predictive marginal densities and space-time trajectories.\nUpcoming challenges related to generating improved and new types of forecasts,\nas well as their verification and value to forecast users, are finally\ndiscussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Dec 2013 06:49:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-24"}

Using the first release of stellar\nparameters and abundances of the Gaia-ESO Survey, we analyse the chemical\nproperties of stars in three old/intermediate-age open clusters, namely NGC\n6705, NGC 4815, and Trumpler 20, all located in the inner part of the Galactic\ndisk at Galactocentric radius R$_{GC}\\sim$7 kpc, aiming at proving their\nhomogeneity and at comparing them with the field population. We study the\nabundance ratios of elements belonging to two different nucleosynthetic\nchannels: $\\alpha$-elements and iron-peak elements. The main results can be\nsummarised as follows: i) cluster members are chemically homogeneous within\n3-$\\sigma$ in all analysed elements; ii) the three clusters have comparable\n[El/Fe] patters within $\\sim$1-$\\sigma$, but they differ in their global metal\ncontent [El/H], with NGC 4815 having the lowest metallicity. Their [El/Fe]\nratios show differences and analogies with those of the field population, both\nin the solar neighbourhood and in the bulge/inner disk; iii) comparing the\nabundance ratios with the results of two chemical evolution models and with\nfield star abundance distributions, we find that the abundance ratios of Mg,\nNi, Ca in NGC 6705 might require an inner birthplace, implying a subsequent\nvariation of its R$_{GC}$ during its lifetime, consistent with previous orbit\ndetermination. The full dataset of the Gaia-ESO Survey will be a superlative\ntool to constrain the chemical evolution of our Galaxy by disentangling\ndifferent formation and evolution scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Dec 2013 07:02:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

In this paper a framework is\npresented for modelling systems in geometric control theory in a manner that\ndoes not make any choice of parameterisation by control; the systems are called\n\"tautological control systems.\" For the framework to be coherent, it relies in\na fundamental way on topologies for spaces of vector fields.

In each case,\nexplicit geometric seminorms are provided for the topologies of spaces of\nvector fields that enable straightforward descriptions of time-varying vector\nfields and control systems. As part of the development, theorems are proved for\nregular (including real analytic) dependence on initial conditions of flows of\nvector fields depending measurably on time. Classes of \"ordinary\" control\nsystems are characterised that interact with the regularity under consideration\nin a comprehensive way. In this framework, for example, the statement that \"a\nsmooth or real analytic control-affine system is a smooth or real analytic\ncontrol system\" becomes a theorem. Correspondences between ordinary control\nsystems and tautological control systems are carefully examined, and trajectory\ncorrespondence between the two classes is proved for control-affine systems and\nfor systems with general control dependence when the control set is compact.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Dec 2013 07:02:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Jan 2014 00:18:45 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 8 May 2014 20:45:56 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 13 Jun 2014 10:38:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-16"}

The advantage compared to the existing\nIETF STUN (RFC 5389), TURN (RFC 5766) and ICE (RFC 5245) protocols is that it\ndoes not require a public host and port mapping for each participating local\nhost, and it works with more restrictive firewall policies. WebRTC implements\nICE which combines STUN and TURN probes to automatically find the best\nconnection between two peers who want to communicate. In corporate networks,\nsimple hole punching and NAT traversal techniques typically do not work, e.g.\nbecause of symmetric NATs. Dynamic allocation of ports on an external 3rd party\nrelay service is also typically blocked on restricted hosts. In our use case,\ndoctors at hospitals can only access port 80 through the hospital firewall on\nexternal machines, and they need to communicate with patients who are typically\nbehind a NAT in a local WiFi network. VPN solutions only work for staff but not\nbetween patients and staff. Our solution solves this problem by redirecting all\nWebRTC traffic through a gateway service on the local network that has a secure\ntunnel established with a public gateway. The public gateway redirects traffic\nfrom multiple concurrent streams securely between local gateway services that\nconnect to it. The local gateways also communicate with browsers on their local\nnetwork to mimic a direct browser-to-browser connection without having to\nchange the browser runtime. We have demonstrated that this technique works well\nwithin the hospital network and arbitrary patient networks, without the need\nfor any individual host configuration. In our evaluation we show that the\nlatency overhead is 18-20 ms for each concurrent stream added to the same\ngateway service.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Dec 2013 10:02:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-24"}

Meanwhile, the mobility patterns of\nmobile devices strongly depend on the users' movements, which are closely\nrelated to their social relationships and behaviors. Consequently, today's\nmobile networks are becoming increasingly human centric. This leads to the\nemergence of a new field which we call socially-aware networking (SAN). One of\nthe major features of SAN is that social awareness becomes indispensable\ninformation for the design of networking solutions. This emerging paradigm is\napplicable to various types of networks (e.g. opportunistic networks, mobile\nsocial networks, delay tolerant networks, ad hoc networks, etc) where the users\nhave social relationships and interactions. By exploiting social properties of\nnodes, SAN can provide better networking support to innovative applications and\nservices. In addition, it facilitates the convergence of human society and\ncyber physical systems. In this paper, for the first time, to the best of our\nknowledge, we present a survey of this emerging field. Basic concepts of SAN\nare introduced. We intend to generalize the widely-used social properties in\nthis regard.

In the\ntraditional predictive modeling instances are described by observable\nvariables, called attributes. The goal is to learn a model for predicting the\ntarget variable for unseen instances. For example, for marketing purposes a\ncompany consider profiling a new user based on her observed web browsing\nbehavior, referral keywords or other relevant information. In many real world\napplications the values of some attributes are not only observable, but can be\nactively decided by a decision maker. Furthermore, in some of such applications\nthe decision maker is interested not only to generate accurate predictions, but\nto maximize the probability of the desired outcome. For example, a direct\nmarketing manager can choose which type of a special offer to send to a client\n(actionable attribute), hoping that the right choice will result in a positive\nresponse with a higher probability. We study how to learn to choose the value\nof an actionable attribute in order to maximize the probability of a desired\noutcome in predictive modeling.

The problem of obtaining tight\nbounds on the Betti numbers of semi-algebraic subsets of $\\mathrm{R}^k$ in\nterms of the number and degrees of the defining polynomials has been an\nimportant problem in real algebraic geometry with the first results due to\nOle{\\u\\i}nik and Petrovski{\\u\\i}, Thom and Milnor. These bounds are all\nexponential in the number of variables $k$. Motivated by several applications\nin real algebraic geometry, as well as in theoretical computer science, where\nsuch bounds have found applications, we consider in this paper the problem of\nbounding the equivariant Betti numbers of symmetric algebraic and\nsemi-algebraic subsets of $\\mathrm{R}^k$. We obtain several asymptotically\ntight upper bounds. In particular, we prove that if $S\\subset \\mathrm{R}^k$ is\na semi-algebraic subset defined by a finite set of $s$ symmetric polynomials of\ndegree at most $d$, then the sum of the $\\mathfrak{S}_k$-equivariant Betti\nnumbers of $S$ with coefficients in $\\mathbb{Q}$ is bounded by $(skd)^{O(d)}$.\nUnlike the classical bounds on the ordinary Betti numbers of real algebraic\nvarieties and semi-algebraic sets, the above bound is polynomial in $k$ when\nthe degrees of the defining polynomials are bounded by a constant. As an\napplication we improve the best known bound on the ordinary Betti numbers of\nthe projection of a compact algebraic set improving for any fixed degree the\nbest previously known bound for this problem due to Gabrielov, Vorobjov and\nZell.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Dec 2013 15:50:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Jan 2014 08:02:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 24 Aug 2014 20:11:33 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 4 Sep 2014 21:39:16 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 19 Aug 2016 14:37:05 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Wed, 5 Oct 2016 13:44:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-06"}

Typically, these results guarantee the existence of linear\nor polynomial kernels on sparse graph classes for problems satisfying some\ngeneric conditions but, mainly due to their generality, it is not clear how to\nderive from them constructive kernels with explicit constants. In this paper we\nmake a step toward a fully constructive meta-kernelization theory on sparse\ngraphs. Our approach is based on a more explicit protrusion replacement\nmachinery that, instead of expressibility in CMSO logic, uses dynamic\nprogramming, which allows us to find an explicit upper bound on the size of the\nderived kernels. We demonstrate the usefulness of our techniques by providing\nthe first explicit linear kernels for $r$-Dominating Set and $r$-Scattered Set\non apex-minor-free graphs, and for Planar-\\mathcal{F}-Deletion on graphs\nexcluding a fixed (topological) minor in the case where all the graphs in\n\\mathcal{F} are connected.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Dec 2013 15:54:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 2 Apr 2014 16:10:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 7 May 2014 15:28:52 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 20 Nov 2014 13:03:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-21"}
