The comparisons reveal that\nin spite of the significantly different parameterizations for star formation\nand feedback processes, the three models yield qualitatively similar\npredictions for the assembly histories of galaxy stellar mass and star\nformation over cosmic time. We show that the SAMs generally require strong\noutflows to suppress star formation in low-mass halos to match the present day\nstellar mass function. However, all of the models considered produce\npredictions for the star formation rates and metallicities of low-mass galaxies\nthat are inconsistent with existing data and diverge between the models. We\nsuggest that large differences in the metallicity relations and small\ndifferences in the stellar mass assembly histories of model galaxies stem from\ndifferent assumptions for the outflow mass-loading factor. Importantly, while\nmore accurate observational measurements for stellar mass, SFR and metallicity\nof galaxies at 1<z<5 will discriminate between models, the discrepancies\nbetween the models and existing data of these observables have already revealed\nchallenging problems in understanding star formation and its feedback in galaxy\nformation.

The underlying assumption that objects from semantically related\nclasses look alike is formalized in our novel Associative Embedding (AE)\nrepresentation. AE recovers the latent low-dimensional space of appearance\nvariations among image windows. The dimensions of AE space tend to correspond\nto aspects of window appearance (e.g. side view, close up, background). We\nmodel the overlap of a window with an object using Gaussian Processes (GP)\nregression, which spreads annotation smoothly through AE space. The\nprobabilistic nature of GP allows our method to perform self-assessment, i.e.\nassigning a quality estimate to its own output. It enables trading off the\namount of returned annotations for their quality. A large scale experiment on\n219 classes and 0.5 million images demonstrates that our method outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods and baselines for both object localization and\nsegmentation. Using self-assessment we can automatically return bounding-box\nannotations for 30% of all images with high localization accuracy (i.e.~73%\naverage overlap with ground-truth).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Dec 2013 16:59:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 30 Jul 2014 13:21:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-31"}

We test the hypothesis of O Vz stars (characterized by having HeII4686\nstronger in absorption than other He lines in their blue-violet spectra) being\nat a younger evolutionary stage than are normal O-type dwarfs. METHODS. We have\nperformed a quantitative spectroscopic analysis of a sample of 38 O Vz and 46 O\nV stars, identified by the VLT-FLAMES Tarantula Survey in the 30 Doradus region\nof the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). We obtained the stellar and wind\nparameters of both samples using the FASTWIND stellar atmosphere code and the\nIACOB-GBAT grid-based automatic tool. In the framework of a differential study,\nwe compared the physical and evolutionary properties of both samples, regarding\nTeff, logg, logQ and logL. We also investigated the predictions of the FASTWIND\ncode about the O Vz phenomenon. RESULTS. We find a differential distribution of\nobjects in terms of effective temperature, with O Vz stars dominant at\nintermediate values. The O Vz stars in 30 Doradus tend to be younger and less\nluminous, and they have weaker winds than the O V stars, but we also find\nexamples with ages of 2-4 Myr and with luminosities and winds that are similar\nto those of normal O dwarfs. Moreover, the O Vz stars do not appear to have\nhigher gravities than the O V stars. In addition to effective temperature and\nwind strength, our FASTWIND predictions indicate how important it is to take\nother stellar parameters (gravity and projected rotational velocity) into\naccount for correctly interpreting the O Vz phenomenon. CONCLUSIONS. In\ngeneral, the O Vz stars appear to be on or very close to the ZAMS, but there\nare some examples where the Vz classification does not necessarily imply\nextreme youth. In particular, the presence of O Vz stars in our sample at more\nevolved phases than expected is likely a consequence of modest O-star winds\nowing to the low-metallicity environment of the LMC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Dec 2013 19:02:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

By\nfitting the level spacing distributions, deformed random matrix ensembles which\nmodel multifractality of the wave functions typical of the Anderson\nlocalization transition, are shown to provide an excellent effective\ndescription for such a critical statistics. Next we carry over the above\nstrategy for the Anderson Hamiltonians to the Dirac spectra. For the staggered\nDirac operators of QCD with 2+1 flavors of dynamical quarks at the physical\npoint and of SU(2) quenched gauge theory, we identify the precise location of\nthe mobility edge as the scale-invariant fixed point of the level spacing\ndistribution. The eigenvalues around the mobility edge are shown to obey\ncritical statistics described by the aforementioned deformed random matrix\nensembles of unitary and symplectic classes. The best-fitting deformation\nparameter for QCD at the physical point turns out to be consistent with the\nAnderson Hamiltonian in the unitary class.

Recent analyses from\nPlanck CMB data do not exclude the presence of non-Gaussianity of small\namplitude, although they are consistent with the Gaussian hypothesis. The use\nof different techniques is essential to provide information about types and\namplitudes of non-Gaussianities in the CMB data. In particular, we find\ninteresting to construct an estimator based upon the combination of two\npowerful statistical tools that appears to be sensitive enough to detect tiny\ndeviations from Gaussianity in CMB maps. This estimator combines the Minkowski\nfunctionals with a Neural Network, maximizing a tool widely used to study\nnon-Gaussian signals with a reinforcement of another tool designed to identify\npatterns in a data set. We test our estimator by analyzing simulated CMB maps\ncontaminated with different amounts of local primordial non-Gaussianity\nquantified by the dimensionless parameter fNL. We apply it to these sets of CMB\nmaps and find \\gtrsim 98% of chance of positive detection, even for small\nintensity local non-Gaussianity like fNL = 38 +/- 18, the current limit from\nPlanck data for large angular scales. Additionally, we test the suitability to\ndistinguish between primary and secondary non-Gaussianities and find out that\nour method successfully classifies ~ 95% of the tested maps. Furthermore, we\nanalyze the foreground-cleaned Planck maps obtaining constraints for\nnon-Gaussianity at large-angles that are in good agreement with recent\nconstraints. Finally, we also test the robustness of our estimator including\ncut-sky masks and realistic noise maps measured by Planck, obtaining successful\nresults as well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Dec 2013 19:56:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

Aims: To use a sparse\nGalactic plane survey of the 1.9 THz [C II] spectral line from the Herschel\nOpen Time Key Programme, Galactic Observations of Terahertz C+ (GOT C+), to\ncharacterize the H2 gas without CO in a statistically significant sample of\nclouds.

We combine these\nwith HI spectra, along with excitation models and cloud models of C+, to\ndetermine the column densities and fractional mass of CO-dark H2 clouds.\nResults: We identify 1804 narrow velocity [CII] interstellar cloud components\nin different categories. About 840 are diffuse molecular clouds with no CO, 510\nare transition clouds containing [CII] and 12CO, but no 13CO, and the remainder\nare dense molecular clouds containing 13CO emission.

Observationally, the number of small-radius, transiting\nplanets with accompanying mass measurements is insufficient for a robust\ndetermination of the transitional mass or radius. Theoretically, models predict\nthat rocky planets can grow large enough to become gas giants when they reach\n~10 Earth-masses, but the transitional mass remains unknown. Here I show how\ntransit data, interpreted in the context of tidal theory, can reveal the\ncritical radius that separates rocky and gaseous exoplanets. Standard tidal\nmodels predict that rocky exoplanets' orbits are tidally circularized much more\nrapidly than gaseous bodies', suggesting the former will tend to be found on\ncircular orbits at larger semi-major axes than the latter. Well-sampled\ntransits can provide a minimum eccentricity of the orbit, allowing a\nmeasurement of this differential circularization. I show that this effect\nshould be present in the data from the Kepler spacecraft, but is not apparent.\nInstead, it appears that there is no evidence of tidal circularization at any\nplanetary radius, probably because the publicly-available data, particularly\nthe impact parameters, are not accurate enough. I also review the bias in the\ntransit duration toward values that are smaller than that of planets on\ncircular orbits, stressing that the azimuthal velocity of the planet determines\nthe transit duration. The ensemble of Kepler planet candidates may be able to\ndetermine the critical radius between rocky and gaseous exoplanets, tidal\ndissipation as a function of planetary radius, and discriminate between tidal\nmodels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Dec 2013 21:00:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

However, at increasing\nredshift, clusters evolve considerably in star-formation activity and so are\nless likely to be identified using the widely-used red sequence method. Here we\nassess the viability of instead identifying high redshift clustering using\nactively star-forming galaxies (SMGs associated with over-densities of\nBzKs/LBGs). We perform both a 2- and 3-D clustering analysis to determine\nwhether or not true (3D) clustering can be identified where only 2D data are\navailable. As expected, we find that 2D clustering signals are weak at best and\ninferred results are method dependant. In our 3D analysis, we identify 12 SMGs\nassociated with an over-density of galaxies coincident both spatially and in\nredshift - just 8% of SMGs with known redshifts in our sample. Where an SMG in\nour target fields lacks a known redshift, their sightline is no more likely to\ndisplay clustering than blank sky fields; prior redshift information for the\nSMG is required to identify a true clustering signal. We find that the strength\nof clustering in the volume around typical SMGs, while identifiable, is not\nexceptional. However, we identify a small number of highly clustered regions,\nall associated with an SMG. The most notable of these, surrounding\nLESSJ033336.8-274401, potentially contains an SMG, a QSO and 36 star-forming\ngalaxies (a > 20sig over-density) all at z~1.8. This region is highly likely to\nrepresent an actively star-forming cluster and illustrates the success of using\nstar-forming galaxies to select sites of early clustering. Given the increasing\nnumber of deep fields with large volumes of spectroscopy, or high quality and\nreliable photometric redshifts, this opens a new avenue for cluster\nidentification in the young Universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Dec 2013 21:00:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

This work addresses the AGN IR-selection dependency on intrinsic source\nluminosity and obscuration, in order to identify and charaterise biases which\ncould affect conclusions in studies. METHODS. We study IR-selected AGN in the\nChandra Deep Field South (CDFS) survey and in the Cosmological Survey (COSMOS).\nThe AGN sample is divided into low and high X-ray luminosity classes, and into\nunobscured (type-1) and obscured (type-2) classes by means of X-ray and optical\nspectroscopy data. Specifically in the X-rays regime, we adopt the intrinsic\nluminosity taking into account the estimated column density (N_H). We also take\nthe chance to highlight important differences resulting from adopting different\nmethods to assess AGN obscuration. RESULTS. In agreement with previous studies,\nwe also find that AGN IR-selection efficiency shows a decrease with decreasing\nsource AGN X-ray luminosity. For the intermediate-luminosity AGN population\n(43.3<~log(L_X[erg/s])<~44$), the efficiency also worsens with increasing\nobscuration. The same sample also shows an evolution with cosmic time of the\nobscured fraction at the highest X-ray luminosities, independently of adopted\ntype-1/type-2 classification method. CONCLUSIONS. We confirm that AGN\nIR-selection is genuinely biased toward unobscured AGN, but only at\nintermediate luminosities. At the highest luminosities, where AGN IR-selection\nis more efficient, there is no obscuration bias. We show that type-1 AGN are\nintrinsically more luminous than type-2 AGN only at z<~1.6, thus resulting in\nmore type-1 AGN being selected the shallower the IR survey is.

Through increases in stratospheric humidity, warming may\nalso cause oceans to escape to space before the runaway greenhouse occurs.

The protostellar evolution is calculated with a detailed\nmulti-zone model, with the accretion rate regulated by feedback from an\nevolving disk-wind outflow cavity. Disk and envelope evolutions are calculated\nself-consistently. In this framework, an evolutionary track is determined by\nthree environmental initial conditions: the initial core mass M_c, the mean\nsurface density of the ambient star-forming clump Sigma_cl, and the\nrotational-to-gravitational energy ratio of the initial core, beta_c.\nEvolutionary sequences with various M_c, Sigma_cl, beta_c are constructed. We\nfind that in a fiducial model with M_c=60Msun, Sigma_cl=1 g/cm^2 and\nbeta_c=0.02, the final star formation efficiency >~0.43. For each evolutionary\ntrack, RT simulations are performed at selected stages, with temperature\nprofiles, SEDs, and images produced. At a given stage the envelope temperature\nis highly dependent on Sigma_cl, but only weakly dependent on M_c. The SED and\nMIR images depend sensitively on the evolving outflow cavity, which gradually\nwides as the protostar grows. The fluxes at <~100 microns increase\ndramatically, and the far-IR peaks move to shorter wavelengths. We find that,\ndespite scatter caused by different M_c, Sigma_cl, beta, and inclinations,\nsources at a given evolutionary stage appear in similar regions on color-color\ndiagrams, especially when using colors at >~ 70 microns, where the scatter due\nto the inclination is minimized, implying that such diagrams can be useful\ndiagnostic tools of evolutionary stages of massive protostars.

The postulates are self-consistent, comply with the requirements of the\nspecial theory of relativity, and satisfy the laws of conservation of energy,\nlinear momentum, and angular momentum. One advantage of the proposed\nformulation is that it side-steps the long-standing Abraham-Minkowski\ncontroversy surrounding the electromagnetic momentum inside a material medium\nby simply \"assigning\" the Abraham momentum density E(r,t) x H(r,t)/c^2 to the\nelectromagnetic field. This well-defined momentum is thus taken to be universal\nas it does not depend on whether the field is propagating or evanescent, and\nwhether or not the host medium is homogeneous, transparent, isotropic,\ndispersive, magnetic, linear, etc. In other words, the local and instantaneous\nmomentum density is uniquely and unambiguously specified at each and every\npoint of the material system in terms of the E and H fields residing at that\npoint.

Our model fit includes up to four components\n(bulge, disk, bar, and a point source) and, most importantly, takes into\naccount disk breaks. We find that ignoring the disk break and using a single\ndisk scale length in the model fit for Type II (down-bending) disk galaxies can\nlead to differences of 40% in the disk scale length, 10% in bulge-to-total\nluminosity ratio (B/T), and 25% in bar-to-total luminosity ratios. We find that\nfor galaxies with B/T $\\geq$ 0.1, the break radius to bar radius, $r_{\\rm\nbr}/R_{\\rm bar}$, varies between 1 and 3, but as a function of B/T the ratio\nremains roughly constant. This suggests that in bulge-dominated galaxies the\ndisk break is likely related to the outer Lindblad Resonance (OLR) of the bar,\nand thus moves outwards as the bar grows. For galaxies with small bulges, B/T\n$<$ 0.1, $r_{\\rm br}/R_{\\rm bar}$ spans a wide range from 1 to 6. This suggests\nthat the mechanism that produces the break in these galaxies may be different\nfrom that in galaxies with more massive bulges. Consistent with previous\nstudies, we conclude that disk breaks in galaxies with small bulges may\noriginate from bar resonances that may be also coupled with the spiral arms, or\nbe related to star formation thresholds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Dec 2013 02:06:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

We combine three\nsamples: the Dwarf Galaxy Survey, the KINGFISH survey and a subsample from\nGalametz et al. (2011) totalling 126 galaxies, covering a 2 dex metallicity\nrange, with 30% of the sample with 12+log(O/H) < 8.0. The dust masses are\nhomogeneously determined with a semi-empirical dust model, including submm\nconstraints. The atomic and molecular gas masses are compiled from the\nliterature. Two XCO are used to estimate molecular gas masses: the Galactic\nXCO, and a XCO depending on the metallicity (as Z^{-2}). Correlations with\nmorphological types, stellar masses, star formation rates and specific star\nformation rates are discussed. The trend between G/D and metallicity is\nempirically modelled using power-laws (slope of -1 and free) and a broken\npower-law. We compare the evolution of the G/D with predictions from chemical\nevolution models. We find that out of the five tested galactic parameters,\nmetallicity is the galactic property driving the observed G/D. The G/D versus\nmetallicity relation cannot be represented by a power-law with a slope of -1\nover the whole metallicity range. The observed trend is steeper for\nmetallicities lower than ~ 8.0. A large scatter is observed in the G/D for a\ngiven metallicity, with a dispersion of 0.37 dex in metallicity bins of ~0.1\ndex. The broken power-law reproduces best the observed G/D and provides\nestimates of the G/D that are accurate to a factor of 1.6. The good agreement\nof the G/D and its scatter with the three tested chemical evolution models\nshows that the scatter is intrinsic to galactic properties, reflecting the\ndifferent star formation histories, dust destruction efficiencies, dust grain\nsize distributions and chemical compositions across the sample.

An important recent development for blazar science is\nthe ability of Fermi-LAT data to pin down the power-law index of the high\nenergy portion of emission in these sources, and therefore also the index of\nthe underlying non-thermal particle population. This diagnostic potential was\nnot possible prior to Fermi launch, when gamma-ray information was dominated by\nthe highly-absorbed TeV band.

We introduce the randomized network interdiction\nproblem that allows the interdictor to use randomness to select arcs to be\nremoved. We model the problem in two different ways: arc-based and path-based\nformulations, depending on whether flows are defined on arcs or paths,\nrespectively.

The recently detected orbits of\ncircumbinary planets are likely inconsistent with planet formation before the\nmass loss.We explore whether new planets may have formed from the ejecta of the\ncommon envelope and derive the expected planetary mass as a function of\nradius.We employed the Kashi & Soker model to estimate the amount of mass that\nis retained during the ejection event and inferred the properties of the\nresulting disk from the conservation of mass and angular momentum.

Photoheating can stabilize the\ndisks in the interior, potentially explaining the observed planetary orbits on\nscales of a few AU. We compare the expected mass scale of planets for 11\nadditional systems with observational results and find hints of two\npopulations, one consistent with planet formation from the ejecta of common\nenvelopes and the other a separate population that may have formed earlier. The\nformation of the observed planets from the ejecta of common envelopes seems\nfeasible. The model proposed here can be tested through refined observations of\nadditional post-common envelope systems. While it appears observationally\nchallenging to distinguish between the accretion on pre-existing planets and\ntheir growth from new fragments, it may be possible to further constrain the\nproperties of the protoplanetary disk through additional observations of\ncurrent planetary candidates and post-common envelope binary systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Dec 2013 13:41:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 21 Dec 2013 21:42:03 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 21 Jan 2014 10:30:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

These\nare first the existence of small anisotropy deviations from isotropy of the CMB\nradiation and second, the presence of large angle anomalies, although the\nexistence of these anomalies is currently a huge matter of debate. These hints\nare particularly important since isotropy is one of the two main postulates of\nthe Copernican principle on which the FRW models are built.

The construction of these wave\nmechanical models of the structure formation is achieved by introducing the\nFisher information measure and its comparison with a highly nonlinear term\ncalled the quantum potential in the wave equations. Strikingly, the comparison\nof the nonlinear term and the Fisher information measure provides a dynamical\ndistinction between lack of self-organization and self-organization in the\ndynamical evolution of the cosmic components. Mathematically equivalent to the\nstandard cosmic fluid equations, these approaches make it possible to follow\nthe evolution of the matter distribution even into the highly nonlinear regime\nby circumventing singularities. In addition, these wave formalisms are extended\nto two-fluid descriptions of the coupled dark matter and baryon matter\ndistributions in the linear regime, in the Einstein de Sitter Universe (EdS) to\nconstruct toy models of the cosmic components in this relatively simple\nUniverse model. Based on these two different wave mechanical formalisms, here\nfully analytical results for the dark matter and baryon distributions are\nprovided. Also, numerical realizations of the emerging weblike patterns are\npresented from the nonlinear dynamics of the baryon component corresponding to\nsoliton-like solutions. These soliton-like solutions might represent a proper\ndescription of filamentary structures even in the linear regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Dec 2013 14:58:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 Feb 2014 08:34:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-25"}

These measurements are obtained\nusing data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 4.5/fb, recorded by the\nATLAS detector in 2011. The data are corrected for detector effects so that\ncross sections are presented at the particle level. Cross sections are measured\nup to 5 TeV dijet mass using jets reconstructed with the anti-kt algorithm for\nvalues of the jet radius parameter of 0.4 and 0.6. The cross sections are\ncompared with next-to-leading-order perturbative QCD calculations by NLOJET++\ncorrected to account for non-perturbative effects. Comparisons with POWHEG\npredictions, using a next-to-leading-order matrix element calculation\ninterfaced to a parton-shower Monte Carlo simulation, are also shown.\nElectroweak effects are accounted for in both cases. The quantitative\ncomparison of data and theoretical predictions obtained using various\nparameterizations of the parton distribution functions is performed using a\nfrequentist method. An example setting a lower limit on the compositeness scale\nfor a model of contact interactions is presented, showing that the unfolded\nresults can be used to constrain contributions to dijet production beyond that\npredicted by the Standard Model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Dec 2013 15:35:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Dec 2013 08:15:17 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 28 May 2014 18:50:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-25"}

Using the elastic net\npenalty we establish a finite sample oracle inequality which bounds the loss of\nour estimator from above with high probability. If the unknown target is linear\nthis inequality also provides an upper bound of the estimation error of the\nestimated parameter vector. These are new results and they generalize the\neconometrics and statistics literature. Next, we use the non-asymptotic results\nto show that the excess loss of our estimator is asymptotically of the same\norder as that of the oracle. If the target is linear we give sufficient\nconditions for consistency of the estimated parameter vector. Next, we briefly\ndiscuss how a thresholded version of our estimator can be used to perform\nconsistent variable selection. We give two examples of loss functions covered\nby our framework and show how penalized nonparametric series estimation is\ncontained as a special case and provide a finite sample upper bound on the mean\nsquare error of the elastic net series estimator.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Dec 2013 15:36:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-13"}
