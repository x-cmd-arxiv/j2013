As in single-antenna systems, the computation of\nthe optimal receiver is an infinite dimensional problem and is thus\nunimplementable in practice. In this purview, we propose three suboptimal,\nlow-complexity algorithms for approximately implementing the MAP symbol\ndetector, which involve joint phase noise estimation and data detection. Our\nfirst algorithm is obtained by means of the sum-product algorithm, where we use\nthe multivariate Tikhonov canonical distribution approach. In our next\nalgorithm, we derive an approximate MAP symbol detector based on the\nsmoother-detector framework, wherein the detector is properly designed by\nincorporating the phase noise statistics from the smoother. The third algorithm\nis derived based on the variational Bayesian framework. By simulations, we\nevaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms for both uncoded and coded\ndata transmissions, and we observe that the proposed techniques significantly\noutperform the other algorithms proposed in the literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Dec 2013 16:04:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-10"}

The novelty of the model is based on a new approach of coupling submodels\nat three biological scales crucial for the early clot formation: novel hybrid\ncell membrane submodel to represent physiological elastic properties of a\nplatelet, stochastic receptor-ligand binding submodel to describe cell adhesion\nkinetics and Lattice Boltzmann submodel for simulating blood flow.

Jansky VLA has revealed a new population of faint\nradio filaments. Like their brighter counterparts that have been observed\nthroughout the Galactic Center on larger scales, these filaments can extend up\nto ~10 parsecs, and in most cases are strikingly uniform in brightness and\ncurvature. Comparison with a survey of Paschen-alpha emission reveals that some\nof the filaments are emitting thermally, but most of these structures are\nnonthermal: local magnetic flux tubes illuminated by synchrotron emission. The\nnew image reveals considerable filamentary substructure in previously known\nnonthermal filaments (NTFs). Unlike NTFs previously observed on larger scales,\nwhich tend to show a predominant orientation roughly perpendicular to the\nGalactic plane, the NTFs in the vicinity of the Sgr A complex are relatively\nrandomly oriented. Two well-known radio sources to the south of Sgr A - sources\nE and F - consist of numerous quasi-parallel filaments that now appear to be\nparticularly bright portions of a much larger, strongly curved, continuous,\nnonthermal radio structure that we refer to as the \"Southern Curl\". It is\ntherefore unlikely that sources E and F are HII regions or pulsar wind nebulae.\nThe Southern Curl has a smaller counterpart on the opposite side of the\nGalactic Center - the Northern Curl - that, except for its smaller scale and\nsmaller distance from the center, is roughly point-reflection symmetric with\nrespect to the Southern Curl. The curl features indicate that some field lines\nare strongly distorted, presumably by mass flows. The point symmetry about the\ncenter then suggests that the flows originate near the center and are somewhat\ncollimated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Dec 2013 17:45:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

In biological contexts, higher sensitivity\ncorresponds to stronger discrimination between molecular substrates with\ndifferent energetics competing in the same reaction. We study this\ndiscriminatory ability in systems with discrete states that are connected by a\ngeneral network of transitions. We find multiple regimes of different\ndiscriminatory ability when the energy of a given state of the network is\nvaried. Interestingly, the occupancy of the state can even increase with its\nenergy, corresponding to an \"anti-proofreading\" regime. The number and\nproperties of such discriminatory regimes are limited by the topology of the\nnetwork.

The observer is allowed to take one observation at a time. It has\nbeen shown in a recent work that if each observation comes from one sequence,\nthe cumulative sum test is optimal. In this paper, we propose a new approach in\nwhich each observation can be a linear combination of samples from multiple\nsequences. The test has two stages. In the first stage, namely scanning stage,\none takes a linear combination of a pair of sequences with the hope of scanning\nthrough sequences that are unlikely to be generated from $f_1$ and quickly\nidentifying a pair of sequences such that at least one of them is highly likely\nto be generated by $f_1$. In the second stage, namely refinement stage, one\nexamines the pair identified from the first stage more closely and picks one\nsequence to be the final sequence. The problem under this setup belongs to a\nclass of multiple stopping time problems. In particular, it is an ordered two\nconcatenated Markov stopping time problem. We obtain the optimal solution using\nthe tools from the multiple stopping time theory. The optimal solution has a\nrather complex structure. For implementation purpose, a low complexity\nalgorithm is proposed, in which the observer adopts the cumulative sum test in\nthe scanning stage and adopts the sequential probability ratio test in the\nrefinement stage. The performance of this low complexity algorithm is analyzed\nwhen the prior probability of $f_{1}$ occurring is small. Both analytical and\nnumerical simulation results show that this search strategy can significantly\nreduce the searching time when $f_{1}$ is rare.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Dec 2013 00:38:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-10"}

Starting from these\nfeatures, we identify microscopic identities holding on the trade clock, and\nthrough a diffusion limit argument, derive continuous time equations which\nprovide a macroscopic description of properties of the order book. These\nequations naturally differentiate between trading via limit and market orders.\nWe give several applications (including hedging European options with limit\norders, market maker optimal spread choice, and toxicity indexes) to illustrate\ntheir impact and how they can be used to the benefit of Low Frequency Traders\n(LFTs).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Dec 2013 03:42:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-10"}

While thick CCDs provide definite advantages in\nterms of increased quantum efficiency at NIR wavelengths, and reduced fringing\nfrom atmospheric emission lines, these devices also exhibit undesirable\nfeatures that pose a challenge to precision determination of the positions,\nfluxes, and shapes of astronomical objects, and features in astronomical\nspectra. Many of the effects seen in these devices arise from lateral\nelectrical fields within the detector, that produce charge transport anomalies\nthat have been previously misinterpreted as quantum efficiency variations.\nPerforming simplistic flat-fielding introduces systematic errors in the image\nprocessing pipeline. One measurement challenge is devising a calibration method\nthat can distinguish genuine quantum efficiency variations from charge\ntransport effects. Given the scientific benefits of improving both the\nprecision and accuracy of astronomical measurements, we need to identify,\ncharacterize, and overcome these various detector artifacts. In retrospect,\nmany of the detector features first identified in thick CCDs also afflict\nmeasurements made with more traditional CCD detectors, albeit often at a\nreduced level.

QC in NSs causes a blue shift of the gap\nenergy with decreasing NS dimension. Directly measuring the effect of QC is\ncomplicated by additional parameters, such as stress, interface and defect\nstates. In addition, differences in NS preparation lead to differences in the\nrelevant parameter set. A relatively simple model of QC, using a\n`particle-in-a-box'-type perturbation to the effective mass theory, was applied\nto Si and Ge quantum wells, wires and dots across a variety of preparation\nmethods. The choice of the model was made in order to distinguish contributions\nthat are solely due to the effects of QC, where the only varied experimental\nparameter was the crystallinity. It was found that the hole becomes\nde-localized in the case of amorphous materials, which leads to stronger\nconfinement effects. The origin of this result was partly attributed to\ndifferences in the effective mass between the amorphous and crystalline NS as\nwell as between the electron and hole. Corrections to our QC model take into\naccount a position dependent effective mass. This term includes an inverse\nlength scale dependent on the displacement from the origin. Thus, when the\ndeBroglie wavelength or the Bohr radius of the carriers is on the order of the\ndimension of the NS the carriers `feel' the confinement potential altering\ntheir effective mass. Furthermore, it was found that certain interface states\n(Si-O-Si) act to pin the hole state, thus reducing the oscillator strength.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Dec 2013 06:51:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

We consider a single cell network formed by the primary users (PU),\nwhich are half-duplex two-hop relay channels and the secondary users (SU) are\nsingle user additive white Gaussian noise channels. In addition, the\ncoexistence constraint which requires PUs' coding schemes and rates unchanged\nwith the emergence of SU, should be satisfied. The contribution of this paper\nare twofold. First, we explicitly design the scheme to pair the SUs to the\nexisting PUs in a single cell network. Second, we jointly design the nonlinear\nprecoder, relay beamformer, and the transmitter and receiver beamformers to\nminimize the sum mean square error of the SU system. In the first part, we\nderive an approximate relation between the relay ratio, chordal distance and\nstrengths of the vector channels, and the transmit powers. Based on this\nrelation, we are able to solve the optimal pairing between SUs and PUs\nefficiently. In the second part, considering the feasibility of implementation,\nwe exploit the Tomlinson-Harashima precoding instead of the dirty paper coding\nto mitigate the interference at the SU receiver, which is known side\ninformation at the SU transmitter. To complete the design, we first approximate\nthe optimization problem as a convex one. Then we propose an iterative\nalgorithm to solve it with CVX. This joint design exploits all the degrees of\ndesign. To the best of our knowledge, both the two parts have never been\nconsidered in the literature. Numerical results show that the proposed pairing\nscheme outperforms the greedy and random pairing with low complexity. Numerical\nresults also show that even if all the channel matrices are full rank, under\nwhich the simple zero forcing scheme is infeasible, the proposed scheme can\nstill work well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Dec 2013 08:40:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-10"}

The coincident detection of the beam velocity\n$^{12}$Be fragments and neutrons permitted the invariant mass of the\n$^{12}$Be+$n$ and $^{12}$Be+$n$+$n$ systems to be reconstructed. In the case of\nthe breakup of $^{15}$B, a very narrow structure at threshold was observed in\nthe $^{12}$Be+$n$ channel. Contrary to earlier stable beam fragmentation\nstudies which identified this as a strongly interacting $s$-wave virtual state\nin $^{13}$Be, analysis here of the $^{12}$Be+$n$+$n$ events demonstrated that\nthis was an artifact resulting from the sequential-decay of the\n$^{14}$Be(2$^+$) state. Single-proton removal from $^{14}$B was found to\npopulate a broad low-lying structure some 0.70 MeV above the neutron-decay\nthreshold in addition to a less prominent feature at around 2.4 MeV. Based on\nthe selectivity of the reaction and a comparison with (0-3)$\\hbar\\omega$\nshell-model calculations, the low-lying structure is concluded to most probably\narise from closely spaced J$^\\pi$=1/2$^+$ and 5/2$^+$ resonances\n(E$_r$=0.40$\\pm$0.03 and 0.85$^{+0.15}_{-0.11}$ MeV), whilst the broad\nhigher-lying feature is a second 5/2$^+$ level (E$_r$=2.35$\\pm$0.14 MeV). Taken\nin conjunction with earlier studies, it would appear that the lowest 1/2$^+$\nand 1/2$^-$ levels lie relatively close together below 1 MeV.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Dec 2013 09:55:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 28 Feb 2014 20:16:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

This model gives an analytical\ndescription of the annual household incomes of all society classes in the\nEuropean Union (i.e., the low-, medium-, and high-income ones) by a single\nunified formula based on unified formalism. We show that the EY model is very\nuseful for the analyses of various income datasets, in particular, in the case\nof a smooth matching of two different datasets. The completed database which we\nhave constructed using this matching emphasises the significance of the\nhigh-income society class in the analysis of all household incomes. For\ninstance, the Pareto exponent, which characterises this class, defines the Zipf\nlaw having an exponent much lower than the one characterising the medium-income\nsociety class. This result makes it possible to clearly distinguish between\nmedium- and high-income society classes. By using our approach, we found that\nthe high-income society class almost disappeared in 2009, which defines this\nyear as the most difficult for the EU. To our surprise, this is a contrast with\n2008, considered the first year of a worldwide financial crisis, when the\nstatus of the high-income society class was similar to that of 2010.

Clear communication\nand representation of the chosen model is crucial for: (1) reproducibility of\nan analysis, (2) model development and (3) software design. Moreover, a\nunified, clear and understandable framework for model representation lowers the\nbarrier for beginners and non-specialists to grasp complex phylogenetic models,\nincluding their assumptions and parameter/variable dependencies.\n  Graphical modeling is a unifying framework that has gained in popularity in\nthe statistical literature in recent years. The core idea is to break complex\nmodels into conditionally independent distributions. The strength lies in the\ncomprehensibility, flexibility, and adaptability of this formalism, and the\nlarge body of computational work based on it. Graphical models are well-suited\nto teach statistical models, to facilitate communication among phylogeneticists\nand in the development of generic software for simulation and statistical\ninference.\n  Here, we provide an introduction to graphical models for phylogeneticists and\nextend the standard graphical model representation to the realm of\nphylogenetics. We introduce a new graphical model component, tree plates, to\ncapture the changing structure of the subgraph corresponding to a phylogenetic\ntree.

The data cube is dynamically decomposed into\nregular and anomalous HI components. A mass of M_HI=1.5 x 10^9 Msun is\nestimated for the anomalous HI - 20 per cent of the total HI mass. Standard HI\ndata products and rotation curves are produced for each dynamical component. In\nterms of circular rotation speed, the anomalous HI is found to lag the regular\nHI by ~25 - 125 km/s. Three-dimensional models are generated and used to\ndetermine the possible location of the anomalous HI.

In the fields of condensed matter, nuclear structure and\nmolecular electronic structure, it has significantly extended the system sizes\nthat can be handled compared to full configuration interaction, without losing\nnumerical accuracy. For quantum chemistry (QC), the most efficient\nimplementations of DMRG require the incorporation of particle number, spin and\npoint group symmetries in the underlying matrix product state (MPS) ansatz, as\nwell as the use of so-called complementary operators. The symmetries introduce\na sparse block structure in the MPS ansatz and in the intermediary contracted\ntensors. If a symmetry is non-abelian, the Wigner-Eckart theorem allows to\nfactorize a tensor into a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient and a reduced tensor. In\naddition, the fermion signs have to be carefully tracked. Because of these\nchallenges, implementing DMRG efficiently for QC is not straightforward.\nEfficient and freely available implementations are therefore highly desired. In\nthis work we present CheMPS2, our free open-source spin-adapted implementation\nof DMRG for ab initio QC. Around CheMPS2, we have implemented the augmented\nHessian Newton-Raphson complete active space self-consistent field method, with\nexact Hessian. The bond dissociation curves of the 12 lowest states of the\ncarbon dimer were obtained at the DMRG(28 orbitals, 12 electrons,\nD$_{\\mathsf{SU(2)}}$=2500)/cc-pVDZ level of theory. The contribution of $1s$\ncore correlation to the $X^1\\Sigma_g^+$ bond dissociation curve of the carbon\ndimer was estimated by comparing energies at the DMRG(36o, 12e,\nD$_{\\mathsf{SU(2)}}$=2500)/cc-pCVDZ and DMRG-SCF(34o, 8e,\nD$_{\\mathsf{SU(2)}}$=2500)/cc-pCVDZ levels of theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Dec 2013 13:00:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 Jan 2014 11:25:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-21"}

To explain this phenomenon, we\ninvestigated the properties of a streamer observed on October 20-21, 2010 by\nthe PROBA2/SWAP EUV telescope together with the Hinode/EIS spectrometer (HOP\n165) and the Mauna Loa Mk4 white-light coronagraph.

We assume that the EUV emission is dominated by collisional excitation\nand resonant scattering of monochromatic radiation coming from the underlying\ncorona. Below 1.2Rsun, the plasma density and temperature were derived from the\nHinode/EIS data by a line-ratio method. Plasma conditions in the streamer and\nin the background corona above 1.2Rsun from disk center were determined by\nforward-modeling the emission that best fit the observational data in both EUV\nand white light. It was found that plasma in the streamer above 1.2Rsun is\nnearly isothermal, with a temperature T=1.43+-0.08 MK. The hydrostatic\nscale-height temperature determined from the evaluated density distribution was\nsignificantly higher (1.72+-0.08 MK), which suggests the existence of outward\nplasma flow along the streamer.

Distinct transitive\nclosures in Fuzzy graphs lead to closures of their isomorphic distance graphs\nwith widely different structural properties. For instance, the All Pairs\nShortest Paths (APSP) problem, based on the Dijkstra algorithm, is equivalent\nto a metric closure, which is only one of the possible ways to calculate\nshortest paths. Understanding and mapping this isomorphism is necessary to\nanalyse models of complex networks based on weighted graphs. Any conclusions\nderived from such models should take into account the distortions imposed on\ngraph topology when converting proximity/strength into distance graphs, to\nsubsequently compute path length and shortest path measures. We characterise\nthe isomorphism using the max-min and Dombi disjunction/conjunction pairs. This\nallows us to: (1) study alternative distance closures, such as those based on\ndiffusion, metric, and ultra-metric distances; (2) identify the operators\nclosest to the metric closure of distance graphs (the APSP), but which are\nlogically consistent; and (3) propose a simple method to compute alternative\ndistance closures using existing algorithms for the APSP.

Previous\nworks proposed a feedback control belonging to the family of the so-called\nback-pressure controls that ensures provably maximum stability given\npre-specified routing probabilities. However, this optimal back-pressure\ncontroller (BP*) requires routing rates and a measure of the number of vehicles\nqueuing at a node for each possible routing decision. It is an idealistic\nassumption for our application since vehicles (going straight, turning\nleft/right) are all gathered in the same lane apart from the proximity of the\nintersection and cameras can only give estimations of the aggregated queue\nlength. In this paper, we present a back-pressure traffic signal controller\n(BP) that does not require routing rates, it requires only aggregated queue\nlengths estimation (without direction information) and loop detectors at the\nstop line for each possible direction. A theoretical result on the Lyapunov\ndrift in heavy load conditions under BP control is provided and tends to\nindicate that BP should have good stability properties. Simulations confirm\nthis and show that BP stabilizes the queuing network in a significant part of\nthe capacity region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Dec 2013 10:41:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 31 Mar 2014 13:48:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-01"}
