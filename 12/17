We decompose its angular dependence into $E$- and $B$-modes, and\nwe calculate the corresponding power spectra, both exactly and using a suitable\nLimber approximation that allows a simpler numerical evaluation. We find that\n$B$-modes are of the same order of magnitude as $E$-modes. Both spectra are\nrelatively flat, peaking around $\\ell=280$, and their overall amplitude is\ndirectly related to the optical depth to reionization. Moreover, we find this\neffect to be one order of magnitude larger than the non-linear kinetic\nSunyaev-Zel'dovich effect in galaxy clusters. Finally, we discuss how to\nimprove the detectability of our signal by cross-correlating it with other\nquantities sourced by the flow of intergalactic electrons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Dec 2013 18:27:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 21 Mar 2014 13:27:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

I apply this formalism to two resource cases: platinum group metals\n(PGMs) and water. Assuming for now that only Ni-Fe asteroids are of interest\nfor PGMs, then 1% of NEOs are rich in PGMs. The dearth of ultra-low delta-v\n(<4.5 km s-1) NEOs larger than 100 m diameter reduces the ore-bearing fraction\nto only ~1 in 2000 NEOs. As 100 m diameter NEOs are needed to have a value >=\nUS$1 B and the population of near-Earth objects (NEOs) larger than 100 m\ndiameter is ~20,000 (Mainzer et al. 2011) the total population of PGM\nore-bearing NEOs is roughly 10. I stress that this is a conservative and highly\nuncertain value. For example, an order of magnitude increase in PGM ore-bearing\nNEOs occurs if delta-v can as large as 5.7 km s-1. Water ore for utilization in\nspace is likely to be found in ~1/1100 NEOs. NEOs as small as 18 m diameter can\nbe water-ore-bodies because of the high richness of water (~20%) expected in\n~25% of carbonaceous asteroids, bringing the number of water-ore-bearing NEOs\nto ~9000 out of the 10 million NEOs of this size. These small NEOs are,\nhowever, hard to find with present surveys. There will be ~18 water-ore-bearing\nNEOs >100 m diameter. These estimates are at present highly imprecise and\nsensitive to small changes, especially in the maximum delta-v allowed.\nNonetheless the low values found here mean that much improved determinations of\neach of the terms of the formalism are urgently needed. If better estimates\nstill find small numbers of ore-bearing NEOs then thorough surveys for NEA\ndiscovery and, especially, characterization are needed. Strategies for the two\nclasses are likely to be different.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Dec 2013 18:29:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-17"}

To this purpose we develop a new inversion\nmethod to map luminosity distance to a LTB metric based on the use of the exact\nanalytical solution for Einstein equations. The main advantages of this\napproach are an improved numerical accuracy and stability, an exact analytical\nsetting of the initial conditions for the differential equations which need to\nbe solved and the validity for any sign of the functions determining the LTB\ngeometry. Given the fully analytical form of the differential equations, this\nmethod also simplifies the calculation of the red-shift expansion around the\napparent horizon point where the numerical solution becomes unstable. We test\nthe method by inverting the supernovae Ia luminosity distance function\ncorresponding to the the best fit $\\Lambda CDM$ model. We find that only a\nlimited range of initial conditions is compatible with observations, or a\ntransition from red to blue shift can occur at relatively low redshift. Despite\nLTB solutions without a cosmological constant have been shown not to be\ncompatible with all different set of available observational data, those\nstudies normally fit data assuming a special functional ansatz for the\ninhomogeneity profile, which often depend only on few parameters.

Another important possible\napplication is not about LTB solutions as cosmological models, but rather as\ntools to study the effects on the observations made by a generic observer\nlocated in an inhomogeneous region of the Universe where a fully non\nperturbative treatment involving exact solutions of Einstein equations is\nrequired.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Dec 2013 18:50:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 Dec 2013 05:02:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-04"}

We analyze the effects of NNLL\nresummation on the stop-pair production cross section by obtaining NLO+NNLL\npredictions in pair invariant mass and one-particle inclusive kinematics. We\ncompare the results of these calculations to the approximate NNLO predictions\nfor the cross sections.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Dec 2013 21:00:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

However, it does not always explain the spectral indices\nof the shape of the spectrum, often fit with empirical functions.\nMulti-wavelength observations are therefore required to help investigate the\npossible underlying mechanisms that causes the prompt emission. We present GRB\n121217A, for which we were able to observe its near-infrared (NIR) emission\nduring a secondary prompt-emission episode with the Gamma-Ray Burst Optical\nNear-infrared Detector (GROND) in combination with the Swift and Fermi\nsatellites, covering an energy range of 0.001 keV to 100 keV.

The DiFFs are\nextracted as Monte Carlo (MC) averages of corresponding multiplicities using\ntheir probabilistic interpretation. To simplify the model and highlight the\npossible mechanisms that create this modulation, we choose the elementary\nCollins function to be proportional to the elementary unpolarised fragmentation\nand a constant probability ($P_{SF}$) for the quark to flip its spin after a\nsingle hadron emission. Moreover, as a leading order calculation, only one of\nthe produced hadrons in the decay chain of the quark is produced with\nelementary Collins modulation. We calculate the dependence of the polarised\nDiFFs on various angles such as the azimuthal angle of the single hadron and\nthe angle of the two hadron production plane $\\varphi_R$ for several values of\n$P_{SF}$.

The basis of\ncomparison was the compatibility with the results of neutron and X-ray\ndiffraction experiments on pure water, using the scheme applied by Pusztai et\nal. (2008). The scheme combines the experimental total scattering structure\nfactors (TSSF) and partial radial distribution functions (PRDF) from molecular\ndynamics simulations in a single structural model. Goodness-of-fit values to\nthe O-O, O-H and H-H simulated PRDF-s and to the experimental neutron and X-ray\nTSSF provided a measure that can characterize the level of consistency between\ninteraction potentials and diffraction experiments. Among the sets of partial\nRDF-s investigated here, the ones corresponding to the SWM4-DP potential\nparameters have proven to be the most consistent with the particular\ndiffraction results taken for the present study, by a hardly significant margin\nahead of BK3. Perhaps more importantly, it is shown that the three sets of\npotential parameters produce nearly equivalent PRDF-s that may all be made\nconsistent with diffraction data at a very high level. The largest differences\ncan be detected in terms of the O-O partial radial distribution function.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Dec 2013 21:09:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-18"}

The traditional ADMM algorithm needs to compute, at each iteration, an\n(empirical) expected loss function on all training examples, resulting in a\ncomputational complexity proportional to the number of training examples. To\nreduce the time complexity, stochastic ADMM algorithms were proposed to replace\nthe expected function with a random loss function associated with one uniformly\ndrawn example plus a Bregman divergence. The Bregman divergence, however, is\nderived from a simple second order proximal function, the half squared norm,\nwhich could be a suboptimal choice.\n  In this paper, we present a new family of stochastic ADMM algorithms with\noptimal second order proximal functions, which produce a new family of adaptive\nsubgradient methods.

Systematic laboratory studies of\nthe photodesorption rates, between 7 and 14 eV, from CO:N2 binary ices, have\nbeen performed at the DESIRS vacuum UV beamline of the synchrotron facility\nSOLEIL. The photodesorption spectral analysis demonstrates that the\nphotodesorption process is indirect, i.e. the desorption is induced by a photon\nabsorption in sub-surface molecular layers, while only surface molecules are\nactually desorbing. The photodesorption spectra of CO and N2 in binary ices\ntherefore depend on the absorption spectra of the dominant species in the\nsubsurface ice layer, which implies that the photodesorption efficiency and\nenergy dependence are dramatically different for mixed and layered ices\ncompared to pure ices.

A plethora of techniques for handling\nlarge datasets, such as Empirical Bayes, or rare events, such as importance\nsampling, have been developed in the literature, but these cannot always be\nsimultaneously utilized. Here we introduce a principled approach to Empirical\nBayes based on importance sampling, information theory, and theoretical physics\nin the general context of sequence phenotype model induction. We present the\nanalytical calculations that underlie our approach. We demonstrate the\ncomputational efficiency of the approach on concrete examples, and demonstrate\nits efficacy by applying the theory to publicly available protein binding\nmicroarray transcription factor datasets and to data on synthetic\ncAMP-regulated enhancer sequences. As further demonstrations, we find\ntranscription factor binding motifs, predict the activity of new sequences and\nextract the locations of transcription factor binding sites. In summary, we\npresent a novel method that is efficient (requiring minimal computational time\nand reasonable amounts of memory), has high predictive power that is comparable\nwith that of models with hundreds of parameters, and has a limited number of\noptimized parameters, proportional to the sequence length.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Dec 2013 21:55:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 Jun 2015 12:40:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

This study focuses on understanding\nthe influence of environmental conditions on bacterial denitrification\nperformance, using a mathematical model of a metabolic network in P.\naeruginosa. To our knowledge, this is the first mathematical model of\ndenitrification for this bacterium.

Before the collapse, the scalar degree of freedom f' is\ncoupled to a physical scalar field, and general relativity is restored. During\nthe collapse, the major energy of the physical scalar field moves to the\ncenter. As a result, f' loses the coupling and becomes light, and gravity\ntransits from general relativity to f(R) gravity. Due to strong gravity from\nthe singularity and the low mass of f', f' will cross the minimum of the\npotential and approach zero. Therefore, the dynamical solution is significantly\ndifferent from the static solution of the black hole in f(R) gravity---it is\nnot the de Sitter-Schwarzschild solution as one might have expected. f' tries\nto suppress the evolution of the physical scalar field, which is a dark energy\neffect.

In this paper we develop a general\ntechnique for computing the number of crossing-free structures of an input set\n$P$. We apply the technique to obtain algorithms for computing the number of\ntriangulations, matchings, and spanning cycles of $P$. The running time of our\nalgorithms is upper bounded by $n^{O(k)}$, where $k$ is the number of onion\nlayers of $P$. In particular, for $k = O(1)$ our algorithms run in polynomial\ntime.

Given that\nthere are several well-studied configurations of points with at least\n$\\Omega(3.464^{n})$ triangulations, and some even with $\\Omega(8^{n})$\ntriangulations, our algorithm asymptotically outperforms any enumeration\nalgorithm for such instances.

Our model is rooted in the observation that\neach individual in a dyadic interaction can do either the same thing as the\nother individual, a different thing or nothing at all. To represent these three\npossibilities, we consider two individuals that can each act in one out of\nthree ways toward the other: perform a social action X or Y, or alternatively\ndo nothing.

First, it is\nproved that the class of two-turn quantum Arthur-Merlin games with quantum\npublic coins, denoted qq-QAM in this paper, does not change by adding a\nconstant number of turns of classical interactions prior to the communications\nof the qq-QAM proof systems. This can be viewed as a quantum analogue of the\ncelebrated collapse theorem for AM due to Babai. To prove this collapse\ntheorem, this paper provides a natural complete problem for qq-QAM: deciding\nwhether the output of a given quantum circuit is close to a totally mixed\nstate. This complete problem is on the very line of the previous studies\ninvestigating the hardness of checking the properties related to quantum\ncircuits, and is of independent interest. It is further proved that the class\nqq-QAM_1 of two-turn quantum-public-coin quantum Arthur-Merlin proof systems\nwith perfect completeness gives new bounds for standard well-studied classes of\ntwo-turn interactive proof systems. Finally, the collapse theorem above is\nextended to comprehensively classify the role of interaction and public coins\nin quantum Arthur-Merlin games: it is proved that, for any constant m>1, the\nclass of problems having an m-turn quantum Arthur-Merlin proof system is either\nequal to PSPACE or equal to the class of problems having a two-turn quantum\nArthur-Merlin game of a specific type, which provides a complete set of quantum\nanalogues of Babai's collapse theorem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Dec 2013 07:33:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Sep 2014 04:18:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-23"}

The mapped IRDCs are located in the range of kinematic\ndistances of 2.7-3.2 kpc. We identify 510 and 352 sources with Gaussclumps and\nClumpfind, respectively, and estimate masses and other physical properties\nassuming a uniform dust temperature. The mass ranges are 6-2692 Msun\n(Gaussclumps) and 7-4254 Msun (Clumpfind) and the ranges in effective radius\nare around 0.10-0.74 pc (Gaussclumps) and 0.16-0.99 pc (Clumpfind). The mass\ndistribution, independent of the decomposition method used, is fitted by a\npower law, dN/dM propto M^alpha, with an index of -1.60 +/- 0.06, consistent\nwith the CO mass distribution and other high-mass star-forming regions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Dec 2013 08:11:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

This associate exhibits a strong\ntendency to align in the direction of the bulk polarization; in fact, ordering\nof defects is also observed in pure PbTiO$_3$ in the form of lead-oxygen\ndivacancies. Conversely, calculations on donor-doped PbTiO$_3$ do not indicate\nthe formation of polar defect complexes involving donor substitutions. Last, it\nis observed that both isolated defects in donor-doped materials and defect\nassociates in acceptor-doped materials are more stable at 180$^o$ domain walls.\nHowever, polar defect complexes lead to asymmetric potentials at domain walls\ndue to the interaction of the defect polarization with the bulk polarization.\nThe relative pinning characteristics of different defects are then compared, to\ndevelop an understanding of defect-domain wall interactions in both doped and\npure PbTiO$_3$. These results may also help understanding hardening and\nsoftening mechanisms in PZT.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Dec 2013 10:04:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-18"}

Two exawatt class facilities (ELI and\nXCELS, Russia) in Europe are already in the planning stage. Realization of\nthese projects will make available a laser of intensity $\\sim 10^{26}$W/cm$^2$\nor even higher.

We next study the seven most popular of those indices in the\ncontext of Internet vulnerability to address issues that remain under-explored\nin literature so far.

We confirm that the fraction of quiescent\ngalaxies is strongly dependent on environment at a fixed stellar mass, but that\nthe amplitude and the slope of the star-forming sequence is similar between the\nfield and groups: in other words, the SSFR-density relation at a fixed stellar\nmass is primarily driven by the change in the star-forming and quiescent\nfractions between different environments rather than a global suppression in\nthe star formation rate for the star-forming population.

We furthermore study the\ninherent geometric properties of multistationarity in $n$-site sequential\ndistributive phosphorylation: the complete vector of steady state ratios is\ndetermined by the steady state ratios of free enzymes and unphosphorylated\nprotein and there exists a linear relationship between steady state ratios of\nphosphorylated protein.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Dec 2013 13:27:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Apr 2014 13:23:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 23 Apr 2014 08:50:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-24"}

The research in the former\ncategory provides a fundamental construction of quantum information theory of\nlocalised qubits in curved spacetimes. For example, this concerns quantum\nexperiments on free-space photons and electrons in the vicinity of the Earth.\nFrom field theory a description of localised qubits that traverse classical\ntrajectories in curved spacetimes is obtained, for photons and massive spin-1/2\nfermions. The equations governing the evolution of the two-dimensional quantum\nstate and its absolute phase are determined. Quantum information theory of\nthese qubits is then developed. The Stern-Gerlach measurement formalism for\nmassive spin-1/2 fermions is also derived from field theory. In the latter\ncategory of research, the process of changing reference frames is considered\nfor the case where the reference frames are quantum systems. As part of this\nprocess, it is shown that decoherence is necessarily induced on any quantum\nsystem described relative to these frames. This process is explored using\nexamples involving quantum reference frames for phase and orientation.\nQuantifying the effect of changing quantum reference frames provides a\ntheoretical description for this process in quantum experiments, and serves as\na first step in developing a relativity principle for theories in which all\nobjects including reference frames are necessarily quantum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Dec 2013 13:37:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-18"}

Despite its relevance,\ninformal approaches to prior sensitivity analysis are currently used. They\nrequire repetitive re-runs of the model with ad-hoc modified base prior\nparameter values.

Our results\nenable us to evaluate efficiently the finite-length performance in terms of the\nnumber of batches used for decoding ranging from 1 to a given maximum number,\nand provide new insights on the decoding performance. Specifically, for a fixed\nnumber of input symbols and a range of the number of batches used for decoding,\nwe obtain recursive formulae to calculate respectively the stopping time\ndistribution of BP decoding and the inactivation probability in inactivation\ndecoding. We also find that both the failure probability of BP decoding and the\nexpected number of inactivations in inactivation decoding can be expressed in a\npower-sum form where the number of batches appears only as the exponent. This\npower-sum expression reveals clearly how the decoding failure probability and\nthe expected number of inactivation decrease with the number of batches.

Currently, a single modern signature capturing the\nsemantics of a malicious behavior can be used to replace an arbitrarily large\nnumber of old-fashioned syntactical signatures. However teaching computers to\nlearn such behaviors is a challenge. Existing work relies on dynamic analysis\nto extract malicious behaviors, but such technique does not guarantee the\ncoverage of all behaviors. To sidestep this limitation we show how to learn\nmalware signatures using static reachability analysis.

The corresponding constitutive equation features a fractional\nderivative in time, a non-local term that can be expressed as a convolution\nproduct which direct implementation bears substantial memory cost. To\ncircumvent this limitation, a diffusive representation approach is deployed,\nreplacing the convolution product by an integral of a function satisfying a\nlocal time-domain ordinary differential equation.

Optical measurements,\nhowever, suffer strongly from extinction and the absence of pronounced\nshort-time gamma-ray variability over years of monitoring is unusual for a\nblazar. We are combining new and archival multiwavelength data in order to\nreconsider the classification and nature of this unusual gamma-ray source. For\nthe first time, we study the radio morphology at 8.4GHz and 22.3GHz, and its\nspectral properties on milliarcsecond (mas) scales, based on VLBI observations\nfrom the TANAMI program. We combine the resulting images with multiwavelength\ndata in the radio, IR, optical/UV, X-ray, and gamma-ray regimes. PMNJ1603-4904\nshows a symmetric brightness distribution at 8.4GHz on mas-scales, with the\nbrightest, and most compact component in the center of the emission region. The\nmorphology is reminiscent of a Compact Symmetric Object (CSO). Such objects\nhave been predicted to produce gamma-ray emission but have not been detected as\na class by Fermi/LAT so far. Sparse (u, v)-coverage at 22.3GHz prevents an\nunambiguous modeling of the source morphology. IR measurements reveal an excess\nin the spectral energy distribution (SED), which can be modeled with a\nblackbody with a temperature of about 1600K, and which is usually not present\nin blazar SEDs. The VLBI data and the shape of the SED challenge the current\nblazar classification. PMNJ1603-4904 seems to be either a highly peculiar BL\nLac object or a misaligned jet source. In the latter case, the intriguing VLBI\nstructure opens room for a possible classification as a gamma-ray bright CSO.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Dec 2013 20:24:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

In addition, strangeness catalyzes the occurrence of a new branch of\nnon-homogeneous solutions at moderate densities. This case study is addressed\nat zero temperature within the SU(3) flavor Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model with the\n't Hooft determinantal flavor mixing interaction. The modulation of the chiral\ncondensates in the light quark sector is taken to be one-dimensional, while\nstrangeness is embedded as a homogeneous condensate in the spontaneously broken\nphase of chiral symmetry. A finite current quark mass for the strange quark is\nincorporated, while the up and down current masses are set to zero. In that\ncase the modulation considered provides an exact analytic solution for the\nsystem. Despite the simplicity of the \\textit{ansatz}, the emerging phase\ndiagram displays a very rich structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Dec 2013 15:22:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 10 Jan 2014 13:52:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

It takes into account: 1) the transition of\nweak knowledge in trustworthy knowledge; 2) the difference in the rate of\nforgetting the trustworthy and weak knowledge. It is assumed that the rate of\nincrease of student's knowledge is proportional to: 1) the difference between\nthe level of the requirements of teachers and the number of learned knowledge;\n2) the amount of learned knowledge, raised to some power. Examples of the use\nof a multi component model for the study of situations in the learning process\nare considered, the resulting graphs of the student's level of knowledge of the\ntime are presented. A generalized model of learning, which allows to take into\naccount the complexity of the various elements of the educational material are\nproposed.

This problem is\nfrequently encountered in wide range of areas including pattern recognition,\nwireless sensor networks, control systems, recommender systems, image/video\nreconstruction etc. Both in theory and practice, the most optimal way to solve\nthe low rank matrix recovery problem is via nuclear norm minimization. In this\npaper, we propose a Split Bregman algorithm for nuclear norm minimization. The\nuse of Bregman technique improves the convergence speed of our algorithm and\ngives a higher success rate. Also, the accuracy of reconstruction is much\nbetter even for cases where small number of linear measurements are available.\nOur claim is supported by empirical results obtained using our algorithm and\nits comparison to other existing methods for matrix recovery. The algorithms\nare compared on the basis of NMSE, execution time and success rate for varying\nranks and sampling ratios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Dec 2013 15:12:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-25"}
