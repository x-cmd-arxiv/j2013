This results both embodies\nthe free fermionic nature of any planar Ising model and eventually gives an\neffective way of computing its partition functions in closed form. An extension\nof this result to non planar models expresses the partition function as a sum\nof Pfaffians which number is related to the genus of the oriented surface on\nwhich the graph can be embedded. In graph theory, McLane's theorem (1937) gives\na characterization of planarity as a property of the cycle space of a graph,\nand recently, Diestel et al. (2009) extended this approach to embeddings in\narbitrary surfaces. Here we show that McLane's approach naturally leads to\nKasteleyn's results: McLane characterization of planar graphs is just what is\nneeded to turn an Ising partition function into a Pfaffian. Using this\napproach, we prove that the Ising partition function on an arbitrary non planar\ngraph can be written as \\emph{the real part}of the Pfaffian of a single matrix\nwith coefficients taken in a multicomplex algebra $\\C_{\\tilde g}$, where\n$\\tilde g$ is the non-orientable genus, or crosscap number, of the embedding\nsurface. Known representations as sums of Pfaffians follow from this result. In\nparticular, Kasteleyn's result which involves $4^g$ matrices with real\ncoefficients, $g$ orientable genus, is also recovered through some algebraic\nreduction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Dec 2013 16:03:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-30"}

We study the problem of scheduling the sleep times of\nthe individual sensors to maximize the network lifetime while keeping the\ntracking error to a minimum. We formulate this problem as a\npartially-observable Markov decision process (POMDP) with continuous\nstate-action spaces, in a manner similar to (Fuemmeler and Veeravalli [2008]).\nHowever, unlike their formulation, we consider infinite horizon discounted and\naverage cost objectives as performance criteria. For each criterion, we propose\na convergent on-policy Q-learning algorithm that operates on two timescales,\nwhile employing function approximation to handle the curse of dimensionality\nassociated with the underlying POMDP. Our proposed algorithm incorporates a\npolicy gradient update using a one-simulation simultaneous perturbation\nstochastic approximation (SPSA) estimate on the faster timescale, while the\nQ-value parameter (arising from a linear function approximation for the\nQ-values) is updated in an on-policy temporal difference (TD) algorithm-like\nfashion on the slower timescale. The feature selection scheme employed in each\nof our algorithms manages the energy and tracking components in a manner that\nassists the search for the optimal sleep-scheduling policy. For the sake of\ncomparison, in both discounted and average settings, we also develop a function\napproximation analogue of the Q-learning algorithm. This algorithm, unlike the\ntwo-timescale variant, does not possess theoretical convergence guarantees.\nFinally, we also adapt our algorithms to include a stochastic iterative\nestimation scheme for the intruder's mobility model.

If we are allowed to only add edges, a tight bound of\n$\\Theta(\\log n)$ on the competitiveness is known. Recently it was shown that if\nwe can add one new edge and make one edge swap upon every vertex arrival, we\ncan maintain a constant-competitive tree online.\n  But what if the set of vertices sees both additions and deletions? Again, we\nwould like to obtain a low-cost Steiner tree with as few edge changes as\npossible.

We give an algorithm that changes only a constant number of edges\nupon each request, and maintains a constant-competitive tree at all times. Our\nalgorithm uses the primal-dual framework and a global charging argument to\ncarefully make these constant number of changes.\n  We then study the natural greedy algorithm proposed by Imase and Waxman that\nmaintains a constant-competitive Steiner tree in the fully-dynamic model (where\neach request either adds or deletes a vertex).

Sensitivity to the mass hierarchy appears whenever the matter\neffects on the 1-3 mixing and mass splitting become substantial.

Whether and what aspects of such acquired traits may be\ntransmittable across generations remains unclear. Using prolonged olfactory\ntraining and subsequent two-forced choice testing in Drosophila melanogaster,\nit is observed that certain aspects of learned behavior were transmitted from\nparents to offspring. Offspring of parents exposed to distinct odors during\nboth aversive and appetitive conditioning displayed a heightened sensitivity to\nthose same odors. The conditioned responses associated with those odors,\nhowever, were not transmitted to the offspring as they displayed a constitutive\npreference to the parent-exposed stimuli irrespective of whether they were\nassociated with aversive or appetitive training. Moreover, the degree to which\nthe offspring preferred the conditioned stimuli markedly varied from\nodor-to-odor. These findings suggest that heightened sensitivities to certain\nsalient stimuli in the environment, but not their associated conditioned\nbehaviors, may be transmittable from parents to offspring.

Even though the largest scale separation has been achieved at this\npoint, these structures are coherent with a size that spans our computational\ndomain dominating the scaling of the energy spectrum, which follows a $E\n\\propto k^{-2}$ power law. As Reynolds number increases curling of the current\nsheets, due to Kelvin-Helmhotlz type instabilities and reconnection, modifies\nthe scaling of the energy spectrum from $k^{-2}$ towards $k^{-5/3}$. This\ntransition occurs at the highest Reynolds numbers of direct numerical\nsimulations with resolutions up to $2048^3$ grid points. Finite Reynolds number\nbehaviour is observed due to the initial correlations without reaching a finite\nasymptote for the energy dissipation rate and with an unexpected scaling\nbetween the Taylor and the integral scale Reynolds numbers, i.e. $Re_\\lambda\n\\propto Re^{2/3}$.

Because these results were obtained for an\nincompressible fluid, their validity for gas planets and stars remains to be\nassessed. A common approach is to take some density stratification into account\nwith the so-called anelastic approximation. The validity of previous results\nobtained in the Boussinesq approximation is tested for anelastic models. We\npoint out and explain specific differences between both types of models, in\nparticular with respect to the field geometry and the field strength, but we\nalso compare scaling laws for the velocity amplitude, the magnetic dissipation\ntime, and the convective heat flux. Our investigation is based on a systematic\nparameter study of spherical dynamo models in the anelastic approximation. We\nmake use of a recently developed numerical solver and provide results for the\ntest cases of the anelastic dynamo benchmark. The dichotomy of dipolar and\nmultipolar dynamos identified in Boussinesq simulations is also present in our\nsample of anelastic models. Dipolar models require that the typical length\nscale of convection is an order of magnitude larger than the Rossby radius.\nHowever, the distinction between both classes of models is somewhat less\nexplicit than in previous studies. This is mainly due to two reasons: we found\na number of models with a considerable equatorial dipole contribution and an\nintermediate overall dipole field strength. Furthermore, a large density\nstratification may hamper the generation of dipole dominated magnetic fields.\nPreviously proposed scaling laws, such as those for the field strength, are\nsimilarly applicable to anelastic models. It is not clear, however, if this\nconsistency necessarily implies similar dynamo processes in both settings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Dec 2013 22:49:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 2 Mar 2015 19:41:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-22"}

We make two contributions. First, we analyze the performance of the\nMCNLM algorithm and show that, for large images or large external image\ndatabases, the random outcomes of MCNLM are tightly concentrated around the\ndeterministic full NLM result. In particular, our error probability bounds show\nthat, at any given sampling ratio, the probability for MCNLM to have a large\ndeviation from the original NLM solution decays exponentially as the size of\nthe image or database grows.

Current efforts have been directed towards\neffective training of auto-encoder architectures with a large number of coding\nunits. Here, we propose a learning algorithm for auto-encoders based on a\nrate-distortion objective that minimizes the mutual information between the\ninputs and the outputs of the auto-encoder subject to a fidelity constraint.\nThe goal is to learn a representation that is minimally committed to the input\ndata, but that is rich enough to reconstruct the inputs up to certain level of\ndistortion. Minimizing the mutual information acts as a regularization term\nwhereas the fidelity constraint can be understood as a risk functional in the\nconventional statistical learning setting. The proposed algorithm uses a\nrecently introduced measure of entropy based on infinitely divisible matrices\nthat avoids the plug in estimation of densities.

Its connection to the underlying string\ntheory can be implemented through higher dimensional supergravities which bear\nspecial characteristics. Their reduction to four dimensions breaks\nsupersymmetry whose magnitude depends both on the compactifying manifold and\nthe mechanism that generates the breaking. In particular compactifications,\nnotably on a $S_1/Z_2$ orbifold, the breaking of supersymmetry occuring on a\nhidden brane, residing at one end of $S_1/Z_2$, is communicated to the visible\nbrane which lies at the other end, via gravitational interactions propagating\nin the bulk. This scenario has been exemplified in the framework of the $N=2$,\n$D=5$ supergravity. In this note, motivated by the recent developments in the\nfield, related to the six-dimensional description of the supergravity theory,\nwe study the $N=2$, $D=5$ supergravity theory as originating from a $D=6$\nsupergravity which, in addition to the gravity, includes a number of tensor\nmultiplets. This reduces to $N=1$, $D=4$ supergravity in a two step manner,\nfirst by Kaluza-Klein reduction followed by a $S_1/Z_2$ orbifold\ncompactification. The resulting theory has striking similarities with the one\nthat follows from the single standalone $N=2$, $D=5$ supergravity, with no\nreference to the underlying higher dimensional $D=6$ supergravity, and a\nstructure that makes the supersymmetry breaking mechanisms studied in the past\neasily incorporated in higher dimensional schemes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Dec 2013 09:08:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Jan 2014 14:27:23 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 4 Mar 2014 19:34:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-23"}

Character methods for the local SU(3)xSU(3) transformation\ngroup are used to establish the count of algebraically independent polynomial\ninvariants up to degree 5 in the components of the density operator. These are\nidentified up to quartic degree in the standard basis of Gell-Mann matrices,\nwith the help of the calculus of f and d coefficients. Next, investigating\nlocal measurement operations, we study a SLOCC qutrit group, which plays the\nrole of a `relativistic' transformation group analogous to that of the Lorentz\ngroup SL(2,C)_R ~ SO(3,1) for the qubit case. This is the group SL(3,C)_R,\npresented as a group of real 9x9 matrices acting linearly on the 9-dimensional\nspace of projective coordinates for the qutrit density matrix. The counterpart,\nfor qutrits, of the invariant 4x4 Minkowski metric of the qubit case, proves to\nbe a certain 9x9x9 totally symmetric three-fold tensor generalizing the\nGell-Mann d coefficient. Using this structure, we provide a count of the\ncorresponding LSL polynomial invariants using group character methods.

Aligning the\nstaffing levels to the forecasted workloads adaptively in such systems is\nnontrivial because of a large number of parameters and operational variations\nleading to a huge search space. A challenging problem here is to optimize the\nstaffing while maintaining the system in steady-state and compliant to\naggregate service level agreement (SLA) constraints. Further, because these\nparameters change on a weekly basis, the optimization should not take longer\nthan a few hours.

The basic feature of this\nspin model is that for each of the three metal-metal links emerging out of a\nmetal site, the Kitaev interaction connects only spin components perpendicular\nto the plaquette defined by the magnetic ions and two bridging ligands. The\nfact that reciprocally orthogonal spin components are coupled along the three\ndifferent links leads to strong frustration effects and nontrivial physics.\nWhile the experiments indicate zigzag antiferromagnetic order in Na$_2$IrO$_3$,\nthe signs and relative strengths of the Kitaev and Heisenberg interactions are\nstill under debate. Herein we report results of ab initio many-body electronic\nstructure calculations and establish that the nearest-neighbor exchange is\nstrongly anisotropic with a dominant ferromagnetic Kitaev part, whereas the\nHeisenberg contribution is significantly weaker and antiferromagnetic.

Compared with the free\nspace wireless communication channel, the underwater acoustic channel suffers\nfrom more severe multipath effect, the less available bandwidth and the even\ncomplex noise. The underwater acoustic channel is one of the most complicated\nwireless communication channels. To achieve a reliable underwater acoustic\ncommunication, Phase Shift Keying (PSK) modulation and Passive Time Reversal\nMirror (PTRM) equalization are considered to be a suitable scheme. However, due\nto the serious distortion of the received signal caused by the channel, this\nscheme suffers from a high Bit Error Rate (BER) under the condition of the low\nSignal to Noise Ratio (SNR). To solve this problem, we proposes a Carrier\nWaveform Inter-Displacement (CWID) modulation method based on the Linear\nFrequency Modulation (LFM) PSK and PTRM scheme. The new communication scheme\nreduces BER by increasing the difference from the carrier waveform for\ndifferent symbols.
