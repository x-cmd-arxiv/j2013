In indoor positioning, GPS receivers cannot be\nused due to the reflections or attenuation caused by obstacles. To detect human\nbeings, sensors such as thermal camera, ultrasonic and microphone can be\nembedded on the rescue robot. The drawback of these sensors is the detection\nrange. These sensors have to be in close proximity to the victim in order to\ndetect it. UWB technology is then very helpful to ensure precise localization\nof the rescue robot inside the disaster site and detect human beings.\n  We propose a new method to both detect human beings and locate the rescue\nrobot at the same time. To achieve these goals we optimize the design of UWB\npulses based on B-splines. The spectral effectiveness is optimized so the\nsymbols are easier to detect and the mitigation with noise is reduced. Our\npositioning system performs to locate the rescue robot with an accuracy about 2\ncentimeters. During some tests we discover that UWB signal characteristics\nabruptly change after passing through a human body. Our system uses this\nparticular signature to detect human body.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Dec 2013 16:24:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-17"}

Recent study indicates that l1-minimization is\nefficient for solving some classes of l0-minimization problems. From a\nmathematical point of view, however, the understanding of the relationship\nbetween l0- and l1-minimization remains incomplete. In this paper, we further\ndiscuss several theoretical questions associated with these two problems. For\ninstance, how to completely characterize the uniqueness of least l1-norm\nnonnegative solutions to a linear system, and is there any alternative matrix\nproperty that is different from existing ones, and can fully characterize the\nuniform recovery of K-sparse nonnegative vectors? We prove that the fundamental\nstrict complementarity theorem of linear programming can yield a necessary and\nsufficient condition for a linear system to have a unique least l1-norm\nnonnegative solution. This condition leads naturally to the so-called range\nspace property (RSP) and the `full-column-rank' property, which altogether\nprovide a broad understanding of the relationship between l0- and\nl1-minimization. Motivated by these results, we introduce the concept of the\n`RSP of order K' that turns out to be a full characterization of the uniform\nrecovery of K-sparse nonnegative vectors. This concept also enables us to\ndevelop certain conditions for the non-uniform recovery of sparse nonnegative\nvectors via the so-called weak range space property.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Dec 2013 16:26:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-17"}

However, the fact that GCs with almost the same\nmetallicity exhibit different HB morphologies demonstrates that at least one\nmore parameter is needed to explain the HB morphology. It has been suggested\nthat one of these should be a global parameter that varies from GC to GC, and\nthe other a non-global parameter that varies within the GC. In this study we\nprovide empirical evidence corroborating this idea. We used the photometric\ncatalogs obtained with the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) of the Hubble\nSpace Telescope (HST) and analyse the CMDs of 74 GCs. The HB morphology of our\nsample of GCs has been investigated on the basis of the two new parameters L1\nand L2 that measure the distance between the RGB and the coolest part of the\nHB, and the color extension of the HB, respectively. We find that L1 correlates\nwith both metallicity and age, whereas L2 most strongly correlates with the\nmass of the hosting GC. The range of helium abundance among the stars in a GC,\ncharacterised by Delta Y and associated with the presence of multiple stellar\npopulations, has been estimated in a few GCs to date. In these GCs we find a\nclose relationship among Delta Y, GC mass, and L2. We conclude that age and\nmetallicity are the main global parameters while the range of helium abundance\nwithin a GC is the main non-global parameter defining the HB morphology of\nGalactic GCs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Dec 2013 17:06:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

An\nincorrectly assumed helium abundance will also lead to a systematic error in\nangular distance measurements based on X-ray and Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ)\nobservations of clusters of galaxies. Its magnitude is further amplified by the\nassociated error in the metal abundance determination, the impact being larger\nat lower ICM temperatures.

Wireless Sensor Network\n(WSN) appears to be the best suitable infrastructure to sense environmental\nparameters of our interests. In this event of earth observation, another\nimportant issue is the monitoring system with high level of precision. There\nare different types of sensors to measure the behavioral aspects of earth.

This algorithm models chain movements induced by\nthe tension propagation and its main idea relies on the sequentialization of\neach movement into a sequence of virtual steps made by chain's segments. In\nthis spirit, any accepted chain's new position is achieved by a move that is\ninitiated by a shift of one segment picked randomly according to a\nproblem-specific probability distribution and then followed by a cascade of\nsome other segments' position rearrangements. The rearrangement process\nterminates when the tension in the chain induced by the initial shift is\nreleased.

Recently, metallic LiOsO3, was discovered to be the\nfirst clear-cut example of an Anderson-Blount \"ferroelectric\" metal, which at\n140 K undergoes a ferroelectric-like structural transition similar to\ninsulating LiNbO3. This is very surprising because the mechanisms for\nstructural phase transitions are usually quite distinct in metals and\ninsulators. Through performing first principles calculations, here we reveal\nthat the local polar distortion in LiOsO3 is solely due to the instability of\nthe A-site Li atom, in contrast to the LiNbO3 case where the second order\nJahn-Teller effect of the B-site Nb ion also plays an additional role. More\nimportantly, the \"ferroelectric\"-like long range order of the local polar\ndistortion is found to be due to the predominantly ferroelectric short-range\npair interactions between the local polar modes which are not screened by\nconduction electrons. Furthermore, we predict that LiNbO3-type MgReO3 is also a\n\"ferroelectric\" metal, but with a much higher structural transition temperature\nby 391 K than LiOsO3. Our work not only unravels the origin of FE-like\ndistortion in LiNbO3-type \"ferroelectric\" metals, but also provides clue for\ndesigning other multi-functional \"ferroelectric\" metals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Dec 2013 01:46:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Sep 2014 07:10:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-01"}

This tutorial introduces the\nphysics of many-boson and many-fermion interference required for the\ndescription of current experiments and for the understanding of novel\napproaches to quantum computing.\n  The field is motivated via the two-particle case, for which the uncorrelated,\nclassical dynamics of distinguishable particles is compared to the quantum\nbehaviour of identical bosons and fermions. Bunching of bosons is opposed to\nanti-bunching of fermions, while both species constitute equivalent sources of\nbipartite two-level entanglement. The realms of indistinguishable and\ndistinguishable particles are connected by a monotonic transition, on a scale\ndefined by the coherence length of the interfering particles.\n  As we move to larger systems, any attempt to understand many particles via\nthe two-particle paradigm fails: In contrast to two-particle bunching and\nanti-bunching, the very same signatures can be exhibited by bosons and\nfermions, and coherent effects dominate over statistical behaviour. The\nsimulation of many-boson interference, termed Boson-Sampling, entails a\nqualitatively superior computational complexity when compared to fermions. The\nhierarchy between bosons and fermions also characterises multipartite\nentanglement generation, for which bosons again clearly outmatch fermions.\nFinally, the quantum-to-classical transition between many indistinguishable and\nmany distinguishable particles features non-monotonic structures. While the\nsame physical principles govern small and large systems, the deployment of the\nintrinsic complexity of collective many-body interference makes more particles\nbehave differently.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Dec 2013 08:32:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 May 2014 08:25:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-09"}

The time scales that we consider are\nsuch that the system is already in microscopic equilibrium (sine-universality\nfor the local correlations), but we have not yet reached equilibrium at the\nmacrosopic scale. We describe the transition to equilibrium on all mesoscopic\nscales by means of Central Limit Theorems for linear statistics with\nsufficiently smooth test functions. We consider two situations: deterministic\ninitial points and randomly chosen initial points. In the random situation, we\nobtain a transition from the classical Central Limit Theorem for independent\nrandom variables to the one for the GUE.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Dec 2013 10:27:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-17"}

This has led many to conclude that such\nsystems have limited value for quantum information tasks, compared to\ndistinguishable particle systems. To the contrary, we show that any\nentanglement formally appearing amongst the identical particles, including\nentanglement due purely to symmetrization, can be extracted into an entangled\nstate of independent modes, which can then be applied to any task. In fact, the\nentanglement of the mode system is in one-to-one correspondence with the\nentanglement between the inaccessible identical particles. This settles the\nlong-standing debate about the resource capabilities of such states, in\nparticular spin-squeezed states of Bose-Einstein condensates, while also\nrevealing a new perspective on how and when entanglement is generated in\npassive optical networks.

Although each approach has made great progress\nindependently, it is only during the last decade that significant efforts are\nbeing made to bring the separate pieces together. Building on previous work\nthat combined analytical solutions and numerical simulations, we apply a\nsophisticated cooling function to incorporate optically thin energy losses in\nthe dynamics. On the one hand, this allows a self-consistent treatment of the\njet evolution and on the other, it provides the necessary data to generate\nsynthetic emission maps. Firstly, analytical disk and stellar outflow solutions\nare properly combined to initialize numerical two-component jet models inside\nthe computational box. Secondly, magneto-hydrodynamical simulations are\nperformed in 2.5D, following properly the ionization and recombination of a\nmaximum of $29$ ions. Finally, the outputs are post-processed to produce\nartificial observational data. The first two-component jet simulations, based\non analytical models, that include ionization and optically thin radiation\nlosses demonstrate promising results for modeling specific young stellar object\noutflows. The generation of synthetic emission maps provides the link to\nobservations, as well as the necessary feedback for the further improvement of\nthe available models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Dec 2013 12:41:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

Thus, one's\nlogical intuitions may need to be recalibrated to work skillfully with\nparaconsistency. To get started, one should clearly appreciate the possibility\nof paraconsistent logics and the genuineness of the distinctions to which\nparaconsistency points.

We\nrecently developed a method for estimating the dynamics of correlated ensemble\nactivity by combining a model of simultaneous neuronal interactions (e.g., a\nspin-glass model) with a state-space method (Shimazaki et al. 2012 PLoS Comput\nBiol 8 e1002385). This method allows us to estimate stimulus-evoked dynamics of\nneuronal interactions which is reproducible in repeated trials under identical\nexperimental conditions. However, the method may not be suitable for detecting\nstimulus responses if the neuronal dynamics exhibits significant variability\nacross trials. In addition, the previous model does not include effects of past\nspiking activity of the neurons on the current state of ensemble activity. In\nthis study, we develop a parametric method for simultaneously estimating the\nstimulus and spike-history effects on the ensemble activity from single-trial\ndata even if the neurons exhibit dynamics that is largely unrelated to these\neffects. For this goal, we model ensemble neuronal activity as a latent process\nand include the stimulus and spike-history effects as exogenous inputs to the\nlatent process. We develop an expectation-maximization algorithm that\nsimultaneously achieves estimation of the latent process, stimulus responses,\nand spike-history effects.

This finding might find beneficial in many contexts which are beyond\nprobabilistic modeling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Dec 2013 09:34:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-18"}

This allows us to construct various classes of exact\nsolutions when the coefficients of the fundamental geometric/ physical objects\ndepend on all spacetime coordinates via corresponding classes of generating and\nintegration functions and/or constants. Such (modified) spacetimes display\nKilling and non-Killing symmetries, describe nonlinear vacuum configurations\nand effective polarizations of cosmological and interaction constants. Our\nmethod can be extended to higher dimensions which simplifies some proofs for\nembedded and nonholonomically constrained four-dimensional configurations. We\nreproduce the Kerr solution and show how to deform it nonholonomically into new\nclasses of generic off-diagonal solutions depending on 3-8 spacetime\ncoordinates. Certain examples of exact solutions are analyzed and that are\ndetermined by contributions of new type of interactions with sources in massive\ngravity and/or modified f(R,T) gravity. We conclude that by considering generic\noff-diagonal nonlinear parametric interactions in GR it is possible to mimic\nvarious effects in massive and/or modified gravity, or to distinguish certain\nclasses of \"generic\" modified gravity solutions which cannot be encoded in GR.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Dec 2013 15:28:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 26 Oct 2014 08:52:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-25"}
