The general diagrammatic expression for an irreducible\nmemory kernel is approximated using a one-loop approximation. 2. The\ngeneralized Enskog projected propagator, which is required for the calculation,\nis approximated using a simple kinetic model for the hard sphere memory\nfunction. The coherent intermediate scattering function (CISF), the\nlongitudinal current correlation function (LCCF), the transverse current\ncorrelation function (TCCF), the incoherent intermediate scattering function\n(IISF), and the incoherent longitudinal current correlation function (ILCCF)\nare calculated and compared with simulation results for the Lennard-Jones\nliquid at high density. The approximate theoretical results are in good\nagreement with the simulation data for the IISF for all wave vectors studied\nand for the CISF and LCCF for large wave vector. The approximate results are in\npoor agreement with the simulation data for the CISF, LCCF, and TCCF for small\nwave vectors because these functions are strongly affected by hydrodynamic\nfluctuations at small wave vector that are not well described by the simple\nkinetic model used. The possible implications of this approach for the study of\nliquids is discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Dec 2013 19:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

The phenomena are first analysed by means of effective operators, which\nallow to discuss their phenomenological consequences and to derive estimations\nabout the mass scale of the heavy particles needed to induce the new\ninteractions. In a second phase we propose models that realise the effective\noperators, allowing us to check the conclusions of effective field theory as\nwell as to extract new phenomenological features of the scenarios considered.\nThe text is divided into two parts: in the first one we apply these ideas to an\neffective interaction that generates magnetic dipole moments for right-handed\nneutrinos, and in the second one we discuss a family of operators that violate\nlepton number without quarks, and which can allow for large rates of\nneutrinoless double $\\beta$ decay and small neutrino masses. The right-handed\nneutrino magnetic moments have the potential to show up in many different\nscenarios, and the nonobservation of the associated phenomenology allows to\nconstrain their value, and therefore the associated new physics scale. The\noperators discussed in the second part of the text can potentially dominate\nneutrinoless double $\\beta$ decay and provide signals in the next generation of\nexperiments; they can be classified according to the chirality of the two\nfinal-state leptons, and induce neutrino mass matrices with a well-defined\nhierarchy related to that of the charged lepton masses.

One can differentiate between forward and backward\npredictability, where forward predictability measures the likelihood of the\nsame adaptive trajectory occurring in independent evolutions and backward\npredictability measures the likelihood of a particular adaptive path given the\nknowledge of starting and final states. Recent studies have attempted to\nmeasure both forward and backward predictability using experimental evolution\nin asexual haploid microorganisms. Similar experiments in diploid organisms\nhave not been conducted. Here we simulate adaptive walks using Fisher's\nGeometric Model in haploids and diploids and find that adaptive walks in\ndiploids are less forward- and more backward-predictable than adaptive walks in\nhaploids. We argue that the difference is due to the ability of diploids in our\nsimulations to generate transiently stable polymorphisms and to allow adaptive\nmutations of larger phenotypic effect. As stable polymorphisms can be generated\nin both haploid and diploid natural populations through a number of mechanisms,\nwe argue that inferences based on experiments in which adaptive walks proceed\nthrough succession of monomorphic states might miss many of the key features of\nadaptation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Dec 2013 19:23:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Dec 2013 22:00:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-06"}

Advances\nin next-generation sequencing technologies will lead to many more rare variants\nassociation studies. Several statistical methods have been proposed to assess\nthe effect of rare variants by aggregating information from multiple loci\nacross a genetic region and testing the association between the phenotype and\naggregated genotype. One limitation of existing methods is that they only look\ninto the marginal effects of rare variants but do not systematically take into\naccount effects due to interactions among rare variants and between rare\nvariants and environmental factors. In this article, we propose the summation\nof partition approach (SPA), a robust model-free method that is designed\nspecifically for detecting both marginal effects and effects due to gene-gene\n(G-G) and gene-environmental (G-E) interactions for rare variants association\nstudies. SPA has three advantages. First, it accounts for the interaction\ninformation and gains considerable power in the presence of unknown and\ncomplicated G-G or G-E interactions. Secondly, it does not sacrifice the\nmarginal detection power; in the situation when rare variants only have\nmarginal effects it is comparable with the most competitive method in current\nliterature. Thirdly, it is easy to extend and can incorporate more complex\ninteractions; other practitioners and scientists can tailor the procedure to\nfit their own study friendly. Our simulation studies show that SPA is\nconsiderably more powerful than many existing methods in the presence of G-G\nand G-E interactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Dec 2013 20:05:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-05"}

This resolves the problem of an apparent age\nspread among the most luminous stars exceeding the expected duration of star\nformation in these clusters. We perform Monte Carlo simulations to probe\nstochastic sampling, which support the idea of the most massive stars being\nrejuvenated binary products. We find that the most massive star is expected to\nbe a binary product after 1.0$\\pm$0.7 Myr in Arches and after 1.7$\\pm$1.0 Myr\nin Quintuplet. Today, the most massive 9$\\pm$3 stars in Arches and 8$\\pm$3 in\nQuintuplet are expected to be such objects.

We find that\nthere is a vast difference in the content shared in China when compared to a\nglobal social network such as Twitter.

When we look\ncloser, we observe that most trends in Sina Weibo are due to the continuous\nretweets of a small percentage of fraudulent accounts.

A single-leader multiple-follower Stackelberg game is then studied to\nmodel the interactions between the CPS and a number of energy consumers (ECs),\nand to find optimal distributed solutions for the optimization problem based on\nthe system model. The CPS is considered as a leader seeking to minimize its\ntotal cost of buying energy from the ECs, and the ECs are the followers who\ndecide on how much energy they will sell to the CPS for maximizing their\nutilities. It is shown that the game, which can be implemented distributedly,\npossesses a socially optimal solution, in which the benefits-sum to all\nconsumers is maximized, as the total cost to the CPS is minimized.

One of the most\npromising NEO candidates for a cometary origin is near-Earth asteroid (3552)\nDon Quixote, which has never been reported to show activity. Here we present\nthe discovery of cometary activity in Don Quixote based on thermal-infrared\nobservations made with the Spitzer Space Telescope in its 3.6 and 4.5 {\\mu}m\nbands. Our observations clearly show the presence of a coma and a tail in the\n4.5 {\\mu}m but not in the 3.6 {\\mu}m band, which is consistent with molecular\nband emission from CO2. Thermal modeling of the combined photometric data on\nDon Quixote reveals a diameter of 18.4 (-0.4/+0.3) km and an albedo of 0.03\n(-0.01/+0.02), which confirms Don Quixote to be the third-largest known NEO. We\nderive an upper limit on the dust production rate of 1.9 kg s^-1 and derive a\nCO2 gas production rate of (1.1+-0.1)10^26 molecules s^-1. Spitzer IRS\nspectroscopic observations indicate the presence of fine-grained silicates,\nperhaps pyroxene rich, on the surface of Don Quixote. Our discovery suggests\nthat CO2 can be present in near-Earth space over a long time. The presence of\nCO2 might also explain that Don Quixote's cometary nature remained hidden for\nnearly three decades.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Dec 2013 00:59:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

In the case with conformal anomaly, there exists local\nminimum temperature corresponding to the phase transition point.

There are three well-known routes to chaos in these deterministic\ndissipative systems, period-doubling, quasi-periodicity and intermittency,\nwhich provide the setting in which to explore the limit of validity of the\nstandard BG structure.

However, the use of very large antenna arrays at the base stations\n(BSs) brings new issues, such as the significantly increased hardware and\nsignal processing costs. In order to reap the enormous gain of massive MIMO and\nyet reduce its cost to an affordable level, this paper proposes a novel system\ndesign by integrating an electromagnetic (EM) lens with the large antenna\narray, termed the EM-lens enabled MIMO. The EM lens has the capability of\nfocusing the power of an incident wave to a small area of the antenna array,\nwhile the location of the focal area varies with the angle of arrival (AoA) of\nthe wave. Therefore, in practical scenarios where the arriving signals from\ngeographically separated users have different AoAs, the EM-lens enabled system\nprovides two new benefits, namely energy focusing and spatial interference\nrejection. By taking into account the effects of imperfect channel estimation\nvia pilot-assisted training, in this paper we analytically show that the\naverage received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in both the single-user and\nmultiuser uplink transmissions can be strictly improved by the EM-lens enabled\nsystem. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the proposed design makes it possible\nto considerably reduce the hardware and signal processing costs with only\nslight degradations in performance. To this end, two complexity/cost reduction\nschemes are proposed, which are small-MIMO processing with parallel receiver\nfiltering applied over subgroups of antennas to reduce the computational\ncomplexity, and channel covariance based antenna selection to reduce the\nrequired number of radio frequency (RF) chains. Numerical results are provided\nto corroborate our analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Dec 2013 07:14:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 26 Mar 2014 14:15:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-27"}

Finally, we also discuss the isospin\neffect on the possible phase transition from nucleonic matter to quark matter.\nResults are critically reviewed, also trying to establish a link, when\npossible, with the outcome of other transport models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Dec 2013 09:29:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

A particular\nfocus is on Kondo destruction, which leads to quantum criticality that goes\nbeyond the Landau framework of order-parameter fluctuations. This\nunconventional quantum criticality has provided an understanding of the unusual\ndynamical scaling observed experimentally. It has also predicted a sudden jump\nof the Fermi surface and an extra (Kondo destruction) energy scale, both of\nwhich have been verified by systematic experiments. Considerations of Kondo\ndestruction have in addition yielded a global phase diagram, which has\nmotivated the current interest in heavy fermion materials with variable\ndimensionality or geometrical frustration.

Finaly, we\naddress the effect of spin-orbit coupling on the global phase diagram, suggest\nthat SmB6 under pressure may display unconventional superconductivity in the\ntransition regime between a Kondo insulator phase and an antiferroamgnetic\nmetal phase, and argue that the interfaces of heavy-fermion heterostructures\nwill provide a fertile setting to explore topological properties of both Kondo\ninsulators and heavy-fermion superconductors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Dec 2013 10:35:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 Dec 2013 08:52:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-14"}

Starting from a catalog of the 1 000 brightest ADF-S sources in\nthe WIDE-S (90$\\mu$m) AKARI band, we constructed a subsample of galaxies with\nspectral coverage from the ultraviolet to the far infrared. We then analyzed\nthe multiwavelength properties of this 90$\\mu$m selected sample of galaxies.\nFor galaxies without known spectroscopic redshifts we computed photometric\nredshifts using the codes Photometric Analysis for Redshift Estimate (Le PHARE)\nand Code Investigating GALaxy Emission (CIGALE), tested these photometric\nredshifts using spectroscopic redshifts, and compared the performances of both\ncodes. To test the reliability of parameters obtained by fitting spectral\nenergy distributions, a mock cataloge was generated. We built a large\nmultiwavelength catalog of more than 500 ADF-S galaxies. We successfully fitted\nSpectral Energy Distributions of 186 galaxies with $\\rm{\\chi^2_{min}<4}$, and\nanalyzed the output parameters of the fits. We conclude that our sample\nconsists mostly of nearby actively star-forming galaxies, and all our galaxies\nhave a relatively high metallicity. We estimated photometric redshifts for 113\ngalaxies from the whole ADF-S sample. Comparing the performance of Le PHARE and\nCIGALE, we found that CIGALE gives more reliable redshift estimates for our\ngalaxies, which implies that including the IR photometry allows for substantial\nimprovement of photometric redshift estimation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Dec 2013 10:40:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

Vela is one of the nearest Galactic composite\nSNRs to Earth accompanied by the Vela pulsar and its pulsar wind nebula (PWN)\nVela X. The Vela SNR is one of the most studied remnants and it benefits from\nprecise estimates of various physical parameters such as distance and age.\nTherefore, it is a perfect object for a detailed study of physical processes in\nSNRs. The Vela SNR expands into the highly inhomogeneous cloudy interstellar\nmedium (ISM) and its dynamics is determined by the heating and evaporation of\nISM clouds. It features an asymmetrical X-ray morphology which is explained by\nthe expansion into two media with different densities. This could occur if the\nprogenitor of the Vela SNR exploded close to the edge of the stellar wind\nbubble of the nearby Wolf-Rayet star $\\gamma^2$Velorum and hence one part of\nthe remnant expands into the bubble. The interaction of the ejecta and the main\nshock of the remnant with ISM clouds causes formation of secondary shocks at\nwhich additional particle acceleration takes place.

A common feature in the application of the\nCCM is to rotate the local spin axes of the (often classical) model state so\nthat (notationally only) the spins all appear to point in the downwards\n$z$-direction. Hitherto, we remark that only coplanar model states have been\nused because they do not lead to imaginary terms in the new Hamiltonian. By\ncontrast, non-coplanar \"three-dimensional\" (3D) model states can lead to\nimaginary terms in the new Hamiltonian after rotation. In principle, however,\nmacroscopic quantities predicted by the CCM (such as the ground-state energy\nand order parameter) should still be real (even though the Hamiltonian may be\ncomplex) because the transformations of local spin axes are unitary. Here we\nexplain how we may use such 3D model states for the CCM and how we may solve\nfor the (now possibly complex) CCM correlation coefficients. We present results\nfor the spin-half triangular-lattice antiferromagnet in an external magnetic\nfield. We use both coplanar model states and a single 3D non-coplanar model\nstate. We calculate the ground-state energy and the lattice magnetisation as a\nfunction of the magnetic field strength. We find that the energies of the\ncoplanar states lie lower than that of the non-coplanar state for all values of\nthe external field, as seen in other approximate studies for this model. We\nfind that the non-coplanar state does not detect the well-known spin plateau\noccurring in this model, although (as seen before) it is clearly observed for\nthe coplanar model states using the CCM. These results are an excellent initial\nvalidation of the new approach for the application of the CCM using 3D model\nstates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Dec 2013 11:53:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 Feb 2014 11:03:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-20"}

The size of\nthe critical cluster varies from $\\sim$8000 molecules (radius$ = 4$nm) at 15K\nbelow melting to $\\sim$600 molecules (radius$ = 1.7$nm) at 35K below melting.\nWe use Classical Nucleation Theory (CNT) to estimate the ice-water interfacial\nfree energy and the nucleation free energy barrier. We obtain an interfacial\nfree energy of 29(3)mN/m from an extrapolation of our results to the melting\ntemperature. This value is in good agreement both with experimental\nmeasurements and with previous estimates from computer simulations of\nTIP4P-like models. Moreover, we obtain estimates of the nucleation rate from\nsimulations of the critical cluster at the barrier top. The values we get for\nboth models agree within statistical error with experimental measurements. At\ntemperatures higher than 20K below melting we get nucleation rates slower than\nthe appearance of a critical cluster in all the water of the hydrosphere in the\nage of the universe. Therefore, our simulations predict that water freezing\nabove this temperature must necessarily be heterogeneous.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Dec 2013 13:52:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-04"}

Our\nhigh-resolution neutron scattering measurements show that the elastic (-0.02\nmeV < E < 0.02 meV) (1/2,1/2,1/2) scattering develops strongly below ~275 mK,\nand correlates with the opening of a spin gap of ~0.06-0.08 meV over most of\nthe Brillouin zone. The concomitant low-lying magnetic spin excitations are\nweakly dispersive and appear to soften near the (1/2,1/2,1/2) wave vector at 80\nmK. The nature of the transition at 275 mK has many characteristics of spin\nglass behavior, consistent with ac-susceptibility measurements. The application\nof a magnetic field of 0.075 T applied along the [1-10] direction destroys the\n(1/2,1/2,1/2) elastic scattering, revealing the fragility of this short-range\nordered ground state.

We focus on cyclic\nactions on $CP^2\\# \\overline{CP^2}$, and our work shows that even in this\nsimple setting, the comparison of $G$-minimality in the various categories,\ni.e., locally linear, smooth, and symplectic, is already delicate and\ninteresting. For example, we show that if a symplectic $Z_n$-action on $CP^2\\#\n\\overline{CP^2}$ has an invariant locally linear topological $(-1)$-sphere,\nthen it must admit an invariant symplectic $(-1)$-sphere, provided that $n=2$\nor $n$ is odd. For the case where $n>2$ and even, the same conclusion holds\nunder a stronger assumption, i.e., the invariant $(-1)$-sphere is smoothly\nembedded. Along the way of these proofs we develop certain techniques for\nproducing embedded invariant $J$-holomorphic two-spheres of self-intersection\n$-r$ under a weaker assumption of an invariant smooth $(-r)$-sphere for $r$\nrelatively small compared with the group order $n$.

The\nmain issue of the classification is to distinguish non-diffeomorphic\n$G$-Hirzebruch surfaces which have the same fixed-point set structure. An\ninteresting discovery is that these non-diffeomorphic $G$-Hirzebruch surfaces\nhave distinct equivariant Gromov-Taubes invariant, giving the first examples of\nsuch kind.

These are form factors of bare particles, i.e.\neigenstates of the pure confinement problem. First numerical results for (bare)\nphoton-nucleon and pion-nucleon form factors, which are the basic ingredients\nof the further calculation, are given for a simple 3-quark wave function of the\nnucleon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Dec 2013 15:49:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-30"}

It is\nconcluded with the help of stiffness parameter, $\\Gamma_1$, that radial profile\nof physical parameters like pressure anisotropy, energy density and higher\ncurvature terms of the $f(R)$ model affect the instability ranges.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Dec 2013 09:44:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 May 2014 03:30:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 3 Jun 2014 11:18:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-19"}

We evaluate the equation of state and deceleration parameters to\nexplore the accelerated expansion of the universe. The validity of generalized\nsecond law of thermodynamics for Hubble and event horizons is also investigated\nin this scenario. For this purpose, we assume pole-like and power-law forms of\nscale factor and construct $f(T)$ models. The graphical behavior of the\ncosmological parameters versus smaller values of redshift $z$ represent the\naccelerated expansion of the universe. It turns out that the generalized second\nlaw of thermodynamics holds for all values of $z$ with event horizon for\npower-law scale factor whereas it holds in a specific range of $z$ with Hubble\nhorizon for power-law and both horizons in pole-like scale factors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Dec 2013 15:05:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}
