The utility purchases electricity for its customers\nvia bulk transactions on the wholesale market, and it passes these costs along\nto its customers, the end consumers, through their rate plan. Typically, all\nresidential consumers are offered the same per unit rate plan, which leads to\ncost sharing. Some consumers use their electricity at peak hours, when it is\nmore expensive on the wholesale market, and others consume mostly at off peak\nhours, when it is cheaper, but they all enjoy the same per unit rate through\ntheir utility. This paper proposed a method for the utility to segment a\npopulation of consumers on the basis of their individual consumption patterns.\nAn optimal recruitment algorithm was developed to aggregate consumers into\ngroups with a relatively low per unit cost of electricity on the wholesale\nmarket. It was then proposed that the utility should group together enough\nconsumers to ensure an adequately low forecast error, which is related to risks\nit faces in wholesale market transactions. Finally, it was shown that by\nrepeated application of this process, the utility could segment the entire\npopulation into groups and offer them differentiated rate plans based on their\nactual consumption behavior. These groupings are stable in the sense that no\none consumer can unilaterally improve her outcome.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Dec 2013 16:59:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 Jul 2015 20:28:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 28 Feb 2016 19:23:38 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 5 Aug 2017 05:42:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-08"}

This problem can be cracked in part by\ninvestigating the macroscopic fluctuations of the currents characterizing\nnonequilibrium behavior, their statistics and associated structures. This\nfundamental line of research has been severely hampered by the overwhelming\ncomplexity of this problem. However, during the last years two new general\nmethods have appeared to investigate fluctuating behavior that are changing\nradically our understanding of nonequilibrium physics: a powerful macroscopic\nfluctuation theory (MFT) and a set of advanced computational techniques to\nmeasure rare events. In this work we study the statistics of current\nfluctuations in nonequilibrium diffusive systems, using macroscopic fluctuation\ntheory as theoretical framework, and advanced Monte Carlo simulations of\nseveral stochastic lattice gases as a laboratory to test the emerging picture.\nOur quest will bring us from (1) the confirmation of an additivity conjecture\nin one and two dimensions, which considerably simplifies the MFT complex\nvariational problem to compute the thermodynamics of currents, to (2) the\ndiscovery of novel isometric fluctuation relations, which opens an unexplored\nroute toward a deeper understanding of nonequilibrium physics by bringing\nsymmetry principles to the realm of fluctuations, and to (3) the observation of\ncoherent structures in fluctuations, which appear via dynamic phase transitions\ninvolving a spontaneous symmetry breaking event at the fluctuating level. The\nclear-cut observation, measurement and characterization of these unexpected\nphenomena, well described by MFT, strongly support this theoretical scheme as\nthe natural theory to understand the thermodynamics of currents in\nnonequilibrium diffusive media, opening new avenues of research in\nnonequilibrium physics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Dec 2013 17:05:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-18"}

Other two conditions,\nexpressing self-duality of a pair 2-forms occurring in the full curvature\n2-form, are also imposed. This leads to a systematic solution strategy, here\ndisplayed for the first time, where all parts of the connection 1-form are\nfirst evaluated, hence the full curvature 2-form, and eventually all parts of\nthe tetrad 1-form, when expanded on the basis of {\\gamma}-matrices. By assuming\nasymptotic expansions which hold up to first order in the noncommutativity\nmatrix in the neighbourhood of the vanishing value for noncommutativity, we\nfind a family of self-dual solutions of the field equations. This is generated\nby solving first a inhomogeneous wave equation on 1-forms in a classical curved\nspacetime (which is itself self-dual and solves the vacuum Einstein equations),\nsubject to the Lorenz gauge condition. In particular, when the classical\nundeformed geometry is Kasner spacetime, the above scheme is fully computable\nout of solutions of the scalar wave equation in such a Kasner model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Dec 2013 18:53:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 Feb 2014 17:42:19 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 11 Oct 2014 14:54:14 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 23 Nov 2014 18:07:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

The majority of approaches incorporate\nrelativity by adding to the Newtonian N-body equations the standard two-body\npost-Newtonian terms for a given star around the black hole or for the close\nbinary in a triple system. We argue that, for calculating the evolution of such\nsystems over timescales comparable to the relativistic pericenter advance\ntimescale, it is essential to include \"cross terms\" in the equations of motion.\nThese are post-Newtonian terms that represent a coupling between the potential\nof the central black hole and the potential due to other stars in the system.\nFor hierarchical triple systems, these are couplings between the potential of\nthe inner binary and that of the distant third body. Over pericenter precession\ntimescales, the effects of such terms can actually be \"boosted\" to amplitudes\nof Newtonian order. We write down the post-Newtonian N-body equations of motion\nincluding a central black hole in a truncated form that includes all the\nrelevant cross terms, in a format ready to use for numerical implementation. We\ndo the same for hierarchical triple systems, and illustrate explicitly the\neffects of cross terms on the orbit-averaged equations of evolution for the\norbit elements of the inner binary for the special case where the third body is\non a circular orbit. We also describe the inspiration for this investigation:\nthe motion of a test body about a central body with a Newtonian quadrupole\nmoment, including the relativistic pericenter advance, whose correct solution\nfor the conserved total Newtonian energy requires including PN cross terms\nbetween the mass monopole and quadrupole potentials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Dec 2013 19:26:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Jan 2014 12:56:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 10 Apr 2014 16:01:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-11"}

Using a modified black-body fit to\nthe data we present all-sky maps of the dust optical depth, temperature, and\nspectral index over the 353-3000 GHz range. This model is a tight\nrepresentation of the data at 5 arc min. It shows variations of the order of 30\n% compared with the widely-used model of Finkbeiner, Davis, and Schlegel. The\nPlanck data allow us to estimate the dust temperature uniformly over the whole\nsky, providing an improved estimate of the dust optical depth compared to\nprevious all-sky dust model, especially in high-contrast molecular regions. An\nincrease of the dust opacity at 353 GHz, tau_353/N_H, from the diffuse to the\ndenser interstellar medium (ISM) is reported. It is associated with a decrease\nin the observed dust temperature, T_obs, that could be due at least in part to\nthe increased dust opacity. We also report an excess of dust emission at HI\ncolumn densities lower than 10^20 cm^-2 that could be the signature of dust in\nthe warm ionized medium. In the diffuse ISM at high Galactic latitude, we\nreport an anti-correlation between tau_353/N_H and T_obs while the dust\nspecific luminosity, i.e., the total dust emission integrated over frequency\n(the radiance) per hydrogen atom, stays about constant. The implication is that\nin the diffuse high-latitude ISM tau_353 is not as reliable a tracer of dust\ncolumn density as we conclude it is in molecular clouds where the correlation\nof tau_353 with dust extinction estimated using colour excess measurements on\nstars is strong. To estimate Galactic E(B-V) in extragalactic fields at high\nlatitude we develop a new method based on the thermal dust radiance, instead of\nthe dust optical depth, calibrated to E(B-V) using reddening measurements of\nquasars deduced from Sloan Digital Sky Survey data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Dec 2013 19:49:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 24 Jan 2014 07:04:26 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 1 Jul 2014 09:14:53 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 20 Jul 2014 13:31:49 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 23 Sep 2014 09:26:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-11"}

Explicitly 22 decay modes\nand the related 52 observables are considered, and some interesting\ncorrelations between them are also carefully examined. Firstly, the allowed\noases of $b-s-Z^{\\prime}$ coupling parameters $|B^{L,R}_{sb}|$ and\n$\\phi^{L,R}_s$ are extracted from $B_s-\\bar{B}_s$ mixing. Then, in the \"SM\nlimit\"~({\\it i.e.,} no new types of $Z^{\\prime}$-induced four-quark operators\narise compared to the SM case), we study the $Z^{\\prime}$ effects on $B\\to\\pi\nK$, $\\pi K^{\\ast}$ and $\\rho K$ decays. It is found that a new weak phase\n$\\phi^{L}_s\\sim -90^{\\circ}$ is crucial for resolving the observed \"$\\pi K$ CP\npuzzle\" and the allowed oases of the other $Z^{\\prime}$ coupling parameters are\nalso strongly restricted. Moreover, the $Z^{\\prime}$ effects on $\\bar{B}_s\\to K\nK$, $K K^{\\ast}$ and $\\pi^0 \\phi$ decays, being induced by the same quark-level\n$b\\to s q\\bar{q}~(q=u,d)$ transitions, are also investigated.

Finally, to check the non-universality of $Z^{\\prime}$ couplings\nto light-quark pairs, we have studied the $B\\to \\phi K$ decays in detail and\nfound that the left-handed $s-s-Z^{\\prime}$ coupling is different from the\n$d-d-Z^{\\prime}$ one, which is due to the large $A_{CP}^{dir}(B^-\\to\\phi K^-)$\nreported by the BaBar collaboration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Dec 2013 19:52:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Aug 2014 07:33:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-16"}

A\nkinetic mixing between the $U(1)_x$ and the $U(1)_Y$ gauge bosons allows for\ndissipation of the symmetric component of dark matter. The case when $U(1)_x$\nis $U(1)_{B-L}$ is also discussed for the supersymmetric case. This case is\nparticularly interesting in that we have a gauged $U(1)_{B-L}$ which ensures\nthe conservation of $B-L$ with an initial condition of a vanishing $B-L$ in the\nuniverse. Phenomenological implications of the proposed extensions are\ndiscussed, which include implications for electroweak physics, neutrino masses\nand mixings, and lepton flavor changing processes such as $\\ell_i \\to \\ell_j\n\\gamma$.

Here, we investigate\nself-calibration methods for linear signal measurements and linear dependence\nof the response on the calibration parameters. The common practice is to\naugment an external calibration solution using a known reference signal with an\ninternal calibration on the unknown measurement signal itself. Contemporary\nself-calibration schemes try to find a self-consistent solution for signal and\ncalibration by exploiting redundancies in the measurements. This can be\nunderstood in terms of maximizing the joint probability of signal and\ncalibration. However, the full uncertainty structure of this joint probability\naround its maximum is thereby not taken into account by these schemes.\nTherefore better schemes -- in sense of minimal square error -- can be designed\nby accounting for asymmetries in the uncertainty of signal and calibration. We\nargue that at least a systematic correction of the common self-calibration\nscheme should be applied in many measurement situations in order to properly\ntreat uncertainties of the signal on which one calibrates. Otherwise the\ncalibration solutions suffer from a systematic bias, which consequently\ndistorts the signal reconstruction. Furthermore, we argue that non-parametric,\nsignal-to-noise filtered calibration should provide more accurate\nreconstructions than the common bin averages and provide a new, improved\nself-calibration scheme. We illustrate our findings with a simplistic numerical\nexample.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Dec 2013 21:00:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 6 Dec 2013 14:51:16 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 6 Sep 2014 15:00:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

The collision of our bubble with\nanother could provide an important observational signature to test this\nscenario. We develop and implement an algorithm for accurately computing the\ncosmological observables arising from bubble collisions directly from the\nLagrangian of a single scalar field. We first simulate the collision spacetime\nby solving Einstein's equations, starting from nucleation and ending at\nreheating. Taking advantage of the collision's hyperbolic symmetry, simulations\nare performed with a 1+1-dimensional fully relativistic code that uses adaptive\nmesh refinement. We then calculate the comoving curvature perturbation in an\nopen Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universe, which is used to determine the\ntemperature anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background radiation. For a\nfiducial Lagrangian, the anisotropies are well described by a power law in the\ncosine of the angular distance from the center of the collision signature. For\na given form of the Lagrangian, the resulting observational predictions are\ninherently statistical due to stochastic elements of the bubble nucleation\nprocess. Further uncertainties arise due to our imperfect knowledge about\ninflationary and pre-recombination physics. We characterize observational\npredictions by computing the probability distributions over four\nphenomenological parameters which capture these intrinsic and model\nuncertainties. This represents the first fully-relativistic set of predictions\nfrom an ensemble of scalar field models giving rise to eternal inflation,\nyielding significant differences from previous non-relativistic approximations.\nThus, our results provide a basis for a rigorous confrontation of these\ntheories with cosmological data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Dec 2013 21:08:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 5 Feb 2014 20:03:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 23 Jun 2014 19:34:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-24"}

We study, by atomistic molecular dynamics simulations, the dynamics\nand structure of hydration water interfacing N-Acetyl-leucine-methylamide\n(NALMA) dipeptide. The DLS response of the solution is consistent with three\nrelaxation processes: bulk water, rotations of single solutes, and collective\ndipole-induced-dipole polarizability of the solutes, with the time-scale of\n130-200 ps. No separate DLS response of the hydration shell has been identified\nby our simulations.

This perturbation is still\nbelow that produced by hydrated globular proteins. Despite this structural\nperturbation, there is little change in the orientational dynamics of the\nhydration layers, compared to the bulk, as probed by both single-particle\norientational dynamics and collective dynamics of the dipole moment of the\nshells.

The divergence has got us into trouble since developing\nquantum electrodynamics in 1930s, its treatment via the renormalization scheme\nis satisfied not by all physicists, like Dirac and Feynman who have made\nserious criticisms. The renormalization group analysis reveals that QFTs can in\ngeneral be defined fundamentally with the meaningful energy scale that has some\nphysical significance, which motivates us to develop a new symmetry-preserving\nand infinity-free regularization scheme called loop regularization (LORE). A\nsimple regularization prescription in LORE is realized based on a manifest\npostulation that a loop divergence with a power counting dimension larger than\nor equal to the space-time dimension must vanish. The LORE method is achieved\nwithout modifying original theory and leads the divergent Feynman loop\nintegrals well-defined to maintain the divergence structure and meanwhile\npreserve basic symmetries of original theory. The crucial point in LORE is the\npresence of two intrinsic energy scales which play the roles of ultraviolet\ncut-off $M_c$ and infrared cut-off $\\mu_s$ to avoid infinities. The key concept\nin LORE is the introduction of irreducible loop integrals (ILIs) on which the\nregularization prescription acts, which leads to a set of gauge invariance\nconsistency conditions between the regularized tensor-type and scalar-type\nILIs. The evaluation of ILIs with ultraviolet-divergence-preserving (UVDP)\nparametrization naturally leads to Bjorken-Drell's analogy between Feynman\ndiagrams and electric circuits. The LORE method has been shown to be applicable\nto both underlying and effective QFTs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Dec 2013 01:07:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Feb 2014 04:53:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

The key feature of this new HDG method is the use of a\nspecial form of the numerical trace of the stresses, which makes the error\nanalysis different from the projection-based error analyzes used for most other\nHDG methods. For arbitrary polyhedral elements, we approximate the stress by\nusing polynomials of degree k>=1 and the displacement by using polynomials of\ndegree k+1. In contrast, to approximate the numerical trace of the displacement\non the faces, we use polynomials of degree k only. This allows for a very\nefficient implementation of the method, since the numerical trace of the\ndisplacement is the only globally-coupled unknown, but does not degrade the\nconvergence properties of the method. Indeed, we prove optimal orders of\nconvergence for both the stresses and displacements on the elements. In the\nalmost incompressible case, we show the error of the stress is also optimal in\nthe standard L2-norm.

The radii range from 0.2 to 15.4 km. This is then\ncorrected for the effects of observational selection using a model published\nearlier by Meech et al.(2004). We estimate that the total number of active JFCs\nbetween 0.2 and 15.4 km is approximately 2300.The active JFC size-frequency\ndistribution, over the range from 0.6 to 10 km where it is best defined, is\nfound to be closer to an exponential distribution in character than a\npower-law. We then develop a statistical model, based on the assumption of a\nsteady state, for converting the distribution of active JFCs to the SFD of the\nsource population among the TNOs. The model includes the effects of\ndevolatization (that produces a large sub-class of defunct nuclei) and\nsurficial mass-loss.

As part of our analysis we calculate the dependence of the surface\ntilt on external electric field and show that it can be eliminated, or even\nreversed from its zero-field value. This is in good agreement with previous\nexperimental work on a system (W415) with a continuous Sm-A*--Sm-C* transition.\nWe also analyze, for the first time, the combination of bulk and surface\nelectroclinic effects in systems with a first order Sm-A*--Sm-C* transition.\nThe variation of surface tilt with electric field in this case is much more\ndramatic, with discontinuities and hysteresis. Near each type of Sm-A*--Sm-C*\ntransition we obtain the temperature dependence of the field required to\neliminate surface tilt. Additionally, we analyze the effect of varying the\nsystem's enantiomeric excess, showing that it strongly affects the field\ndependence of surface tilt, in particular, near a first order Sm-A*--Sm-C*\ntransition. In this case, increasing enantiomeric excess can change the field\ndependence of surface tilt from continuous to discontinuous. Our model also\nallows us to calculate the variation of layer spacing in going from surface to\nbulk, which in turn allows us to estimate the strain resulting from the\ndifference between the surface and bulk layer spacing. We show that for certain\nranges of applied electric field, this strain can result in layer buckling\nwhich reduces the overall quality of the liquid crystal cell. For de Vries\nmaterials, with small tilt-induced change in layer spacing, the induced strain\nfor a given surface tilt should be smaller. However, we argue that this may be\noffset by the fact that de Vries materials, which typically have Sm-A*--Sm-C*\ntransitions near a tricritical point, will generally have larger surface tilt.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Dec 2013 04:04:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

For 2-dimensional systems, described by partial difference\nequations with two independent variables, MDC allows us to define an action on\narbitrary 2-dimensional surfaces embedded in a higher dimensional space of\nindependent variables, where the action is not only a functional of the field\nvariables but also the choice of surface. It is then natural to propose that\nthe system should be derived from a variational principle which includes not\nonly variations with respect to the dependent variables, but also with respect\nto variations of the surface in the space of independent variables. Here we\nderive the resulting system of generalized Euler-Lagrange equations arising\nfrom that principle.

Among different types of WET techniques, the radio\nfrequency (RF) signal enabled far-field WET is most practically appealing to\npower energy constrained wireless networks in a broadcast manner. To overcome\nthe significant path loss over wireless channels, multi-antenna or\nmultiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) techniques have been proposed to enhance\nthe transmission efficiency and distance for RF-based WET. However, in order to\nreap the large energy beamforming gain in MIMO WET, acquiring the channel state\ninformation (CSI) at the energy transmitter (ET) is an essential task. This\ntask is particularly challenging for WET systems, since existing channel\ntraining and feedback methods used for communication receivers may not be\nimplementable at the energy receiver (ER) due to its hardware limitation. To\ntackle this problem, in this paper we consider a multiuser MIMO system for WET,\nwhere a multiple-antenna ET broadcasts wireless energy to a group of\nmultiple-antenna ERs concurrently via transmit energy beamforming. By taking\ninto account the practical energy harvesting circuits at the ER, we propose a\nnew channel learning method that requires only one feedback bit from each ER to\nthe ET per feedback interval. The feedback bit indicates the increase or\ndecrease of the harvested energy by each ER between the present and previous\nintervals, which can be measured without changing the existing hardware at the\nER. Based on such feedback information, the ET adjusts transmit beamforming in\ndifferent training intervals and at the same time obtains improved estimates of\nthe MIMO channels to ERs by applying a new approach termed analytic center\ncutting plane method (ACCPM).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Dec 2013 06:27:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 Mar 2014 11:14:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 22 Aug 2014 22:14:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

Specifically,\nwe put forth a layered decoding framework for convolutional-coded PNC\nconsisting of three layers: symbol realignment layer, codeword realignment\nlayer, and joint channel-decoding network coding (Jt-CNC) decoding layer. Our\nframework can deal with phase asynchrony and symbol arrival-time asynchrony\nbetween the signals simultaneously transmitted by multiple sources. A salient\nfeature of this framework is that it can handle both fractional and integral\nsymbol offsets; previously proposed PNC decoding algorithms (e.g., XOR-CD and\nreduced-state Viterbi algorithms) can only deal with fractional symbol offset.\nMoreover, the Jt-CNC algorithm, based on belief propagation (BP), is\nBER-optimal for synchronous PNC and near optimal for asynchronous PNC.\nExtending beyond convolutional codes, we further generalize the Jt-CNC decoding\nalgorithm for all cyclic codes. Our simulation shows that Jt-CNC outperforms\nthe previously proposed XOR-CD algorithm and reduced-state Viterbi algorithm by\n2dB for synchronous PNC. For phase-asynchronous PNC, Jt-CNC is 4dB better than\nthe other two algorithms. Importantly, for real wireless environment testing,\nwe have also implemented our decoding algorithm in a PNC system built on the\nUSRP software radio platform. Our experiment shows that the proposed Jt-CNC\ndecoder works well in practice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Dec 2013 06:49:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-06"}

A\nharvest-then-transmit protocol is assumed where the AP first broadcasts\nwireless power to all users via energy beamforming in the downlink (DL), and\nthen the users send their independent information to the AP simultaneously in\nthe uplink (UL) using their harvested energy.

Dust grains coagulate to form dust aggregates in protoplanetary\ndisks. Their porosity can be extremely high in the disks. Although disk\nemission may come from fluffy dust aggregates, the emission has been modeled\nwith compact grains. Aims. We aim to reveal the mass opacity of fluffy\naggregates from infrared to millimeter wavelengths with the filling factor\nranging from 1 down to $10^{-4}$. Methods. We use Mie calculations with an\neffective medium theory. The monomers are assumed to be 0.1 ${\\rm \\mu m}$ sized\ngrains, which is much shorter than the wavelengths that we focus on. Results.\nWe find that the absorption mass opacity of fluffy aggregates are characterized\nby the product $a\\times f$, where $a$ is the dust radius and $f$ is the filling\nfactor, except for the interference structure. The scattering mass opacity is\nalso characterized by $af$ at short wavelengths while it is higher in more\nfluffy aggregates at long wavelengths. We also derive the analytic formula of\nthe mass opacity and find that it reproduces the Mie calculations. We also\ncalculate the expected difference of the emission between compact and fluffy\naggregates in protoplanetary disks with a simple dust growth and drift model.\nWe find that compact grains and fluffy aggregates can be distinguished by the\nradial distribution of the opacity index $\\beta$. The previous observation of\nthe radial distribution of $\\beta$ is consistent with the fluffy case, but more\nobservations are required to distinguish between fluffy or compact.

Calculations have been done for the step potential at\nsurface of spherical nanoparticle, and the simple model for the hot electron\ncooling have been used.

The mass on each plane can be represented as\nhalos, simulation particles, a projected mass map extracted form a numerical\nsimulation or any combination of these. The image finding is done in a source\noriented fashion, where only regions of interest are iteratively refined on an\ninitially coarse image plane grid. The calculations are performed in parallel\non shared memory machines. The code is able to handle different types of\nanalytic halos (NFW, NSIE, power-law, etc.), haloes extracted from numerical\nsimulations and clusters constructed from semi-analytic models ({\\small MOKA}).\nLikewise, there are several different options for modeling the source(s) which\ncan be distributed throughout the light-cone. The distribution of matter in the\nlight-cone can be either taken from a pre-existing N-body numerical\nsimulations, from halo catalogs, or are generated from an analytic mass\nfunction.

The recent growth of data on complex social systems and the\npotential to derive stories from them has shifted the focus of journalistic and\nscientific attention increasingly toward data-driven journalism and\ncomputational social science. In this paper we advocate the usage of modern\nstatistical methods for problems of data journalism and beyond, which may help\njournalistic and scientific work and lead to additional insight. Using the\nWikiLeaks Afghanistan war logs for illustration, we present an approach that\nbuilds intelligible statistical models for interpretable segments in the data,\nin this case to explore the fatality rates associated with different\ncircumstances in the Afghanistan war. Our approach combines preprocessing by\nLatent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) with model trees. LDA is used to process the\nnatural language information contained in each report summary by estimating\nlatent topics and assigning each report to one of them. Together with other\nvariables these topic assignments serve as splitting variables for finding\nsegments in the data to which local statistical models for the reported number\nof fatalities are fitted. Segmentation and fitting is carried out with\nrecursive partitioning of negative binomial distributions. We identify segments\nwith different fatality rates that correspond to a small number of topics and\nother variables as well as their interactions. Furthermore, we carve out the\nsimilarities between segments and connect them to stories that have been\ncovered in the media. This gives an unprecedented description of the war in\nAfghanistan and serves as an example of how data journalism, computational\nsocial science and other areas with interest in database data can benefit from\nmodern statistical techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Dec 2013 13:56:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-06"}

Our studies reveal that the\nnumber of transits necessary to detect the $O_2$ in the atmosphere of an Earth\ntwin around M-dwarfs is by far higher than the number of transits estimated by\nSnellen et al. (2013). In addition, our simulations show that, when accounting\nfor typical noise levels associated to observations in the optical and\nnear-infrared, the $O_2$ A-band at 760 nm is more favorable to detect the\nexoplanetary signal than the $O_2$ band at 1268 nm for all the spectral types,\nexcept M9V. We conclude that, unless unpredicted instrumental limitations\narise, the implementation of pre-slit optics such as image slicers appear to be\nkey to significantly improve the yield of this particular science case.\nHowever, even in the most optimistic cases, we conclude that the detection of\n$O_2$ in the atmosphere of an Earth twin will be only feasible with the ELTs if\nthe planet is orbiting a bright close-by (d $\\le$ 8 pc) M-dwarf with a spectral\ntype later than M3.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Dec 2013 15:43:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

Unlike the traditional zigzag scanning method for feature extraction a\ncontinuous scanning method from top-left corner to right then top-down and\nright to left and so on until right-bottom of the image i.e. a spiral scanning\ntechnique has been proposed for better feature selection.
