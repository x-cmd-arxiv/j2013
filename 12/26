The electrical\ntransport measurements at room temperature show that the m-CNT contacted s-CNT\narray devices with a 2 um channel length perform superiorly to those of control\nPd contacted s-CNT devices. The m-CNT contacted devices exhibit a maximum\n(average) on-conductance of 36.5 uS (19.2 uS), transconductance of 2.6 uS (1.2\nuS), mobility of 51 cm2/Vs (25 cm2/Vs), and current on-off ratio of 1.1x10E6\n(2.5x10E5). These values are almost an order of magnitude higher than that of\ncontrol Pd contacted devices with the same channel length and s-CNT linear\ndensity. The low temperature charge transport measurements suggest that these\nimproved performances are due to the lower charge injection barrier of\nm-CNT/s-CNT array devices compared to Pd/s-CNT array devices. We attribute the\nlower injection barrier to unique geometry of our devices. In addition to using\nsemiconducting enriched CNT, our results suggest that using metallic CNT as an\nelectrode can significantly enhance the performance of CNT TFTs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Dec 2013 16:33:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

Tree-search algorithms like backtracking try to\nconstruct a solution to a CSP by selecting the variables of the problem one\nafter another. The order in which these algorithm select the variables\npotentially have significant impact on the search performance. Various\nheuristics have been proposed for choosing good variable ordering. Many\npowerful variable ordering heuristics weigh the constraints first and then\nutilize the weights for selecting good order of the variables. Constraint\nweighting are basically employed to identify global bottlenecks in a CSP.\n  In this paper, we propose a new approach for learning weights for the\nconstraints using competitive coevolutionary Genetic Algorithm (GA). Weights\nlearned by the coevolutionary GA later help to make better choices for the\nfirst few variables in a search. In the competitive coevolutionary GA,\nconstraints and candidate solutions for a CSP evolve together through an\ninverse fitness interaction process.

The\nmorphology of this scattered component is expected to trace the clumpy\nmolecular and HI clouds. We calculate this contribution to the GRXE from known\nGalactic XBs assuming that they are all persistent. The known XBs sample is\nincomplete, however, because it is flux limited and spans the lifetime of X-ray\nastronomy ($\\sim 50$ years). We therefore also use a simulated sample of\nsources, to estimate the diffuse emission we should expect in an optimistic\ncase assuming that the X-ray luminosity of our Galaxy is on average similar to\nthat of other galaxies. In the calculations we also take into account the\nenhancement of the total scattering cross-section due to coherence effects in\nthe elastic scattering from multi-electron atoms and molecules. This scattered\nemission can be distinguished from the contribution of low X-ray luminosity\nstars by the presence of narrow fluorescent K-$\\alpha$ lines of Fe, Si, and\nother abundant elements present in the ISM and by directly resolving the\ncontribution of low X-ray luminosity stars. We find that within $1^\\circ$\nlatitude of the Galactic plane the scattered emission contributes on average\n$10-30\\%$ of the GRXE flux in the case of known sources and over $50\\%$ in the\ncase of simulated sources. In the latter case, the scattered component is found\nto even dominate the stellar emission in certain parts of the Galactic plane.\nX-rays with energies $\\gtrsim 1$ keV from XBs should also penetrate deep inside\nthe HI and molecular clouds, where they are absorbed and heat the ISM.

We have previously shown that ongoing collagen deposition may\nnot lead to significant increases in the bulk modulus of the lung until these\nlocal remodeled regions have become sufficiently numerous and extensive to\npercolate in a continuous path across the entire tissue [Bates {\\it et al.}\n2007 {\\it Am.

Random collagen\ndeposition at a single site is modeled by increasing the elastic constant of\nthe spring at that site by a factor of 100.\n  By contrast, correlated collagen deposition is represented by stiffening the\nsprings encountered along a random walk starting from some initial spring, the\nrationale being that excess collagen deposition is more likely in the vicinity\nof an already stiff region. A combination of random and correlated deposition\nis modeled by performing random walks of length $N$ from randomly selected\ninitial sites, the balance between the two processes being determined by $N$.\nWe found that the dependence of bulk modulus, $B(N,c)$, on both $N$ and the\nfraction of stiff springs, $c$, can be described by a strikingly simple set of\nempirical equations.\n  Our results suggest that the spatial correlation of collagen deposition in\nthe fibrotic lung has a strong effect on the rate of lung function decline and\non the mechanical environment in which the cells responsible for remodeling\nfind themselves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Dec 2013 23:39:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-15"}

How to provide valuable recommendations to viewers is an\nimportant task for both video websites and related third parties, such as\nsearch engines. Previous work conducted numerous analysis on the view counts of\nvideos, which measure a video's value in terms of popularity. However, the\nlong-lasting value of an online video, namely longevity, is hidden behind the\nhistory that a video accumulates its \"popularity\" through time. Generally\nspeaking, a longevous video tends to constantly draw society's attention. With\nfocus on one of the leading video websites, Youtube, this paper proposes a\nscoring mechanism quantifying a video's longevity. Evaluating a video's\nlongevity can not only improve a video recommender system, but also help us to\ndiscover videos having greater advertising value, as well as adjust a video\nwebsite's strategy of storing videos to shorten its responding time. In order\nto accurately quantify longevity, we introduce the concept of latent social\nimpulses and how to use them measure a video's longevity. In order to derive\nlatent social impulses, we view the video website as a digital signal filter\nand formulate the task as a convex minimization problem. The proposed longevity\ncomputation is based on the derived social impulses. Unfortunately, the\nrequired information to derive social impulses are not always public, which\nmakes a third party unable to directly evaluate every video's longevity. To\nsolve this problem, we formulate a semi-supervised learning task by using part\nof videos having known longevity scores to predict the unknown longevity\nscores. We propose a Gaussian Random Markov model with Loopy Belief Propagation\nto solve this problem. The conducted experiments on Youtube demonstrate that\nthe proposed method significantly improves the prediction results comparing to\nbaselines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Dec 2013 00:24:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-30"}

The continuation technique globalizes the\nconvergence of the algorithm, with provable global convergence under restricted\nisometry property (RIP). Further, we adopt two alternative methods, i.e., a\nmodified discrepancy principle and a Bayesian information criterion, to choose\nthe regularization parameter. Numerical experiments indicate that our algorithm\nis very competitive with state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of accuracy and\nefficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Dec 2013 01:40:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

Graphs are used to represent data in many application areas,\nand they are subjected to various computational algorithms in order to acquire\nthe desired information. These graph algorithms tend to have common\ncharacteristics, such as duplicate detection to guarantee their termination,\nindependent of their application domain. Over the past few years, it has been\nshown that the scalability of such algorithms can be dramatically improved by\nusing, e.g., external memory, by exploiting parallel architectures, such as\nclusters, multi-core CPUs, and graphics processing units, and by using\nheuristics to guide the search. Novel techniques to further scale graph search\nalgorithms, and new applications of graph search are within the scope of this\nworkshop.\n  Another topic of interest of the event is more related to the structural\nproperties of graphs: which kind of graph characteristics are relevant for a\nparticular application area, and how can these be measured? Finally, any novel\nway of using graphs for a particular application area is on topic.\n  The goal of this event is to gather scientists from different communities,\nsuch as model checking, artificial intelligence planning, game playing, and\nalgorithm engineering, who do research on graph search algorithms, such that\nawareness of each others' work is increased.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Dec 2013 07:26:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-30"}

As a function of pressure, V2O3\nfollows the expected behavior of increased metallicity due to a larger\nbandwidth for pressures up to 12.5 GPa. Surprisingly, for higher pressures when\nthe structure becomes unstable, the resistance starts to increase. Around 32.5\nGPa at 300 K, we observe a novel pressure-induced corundum-to-monoclinic\ntransition between two metallic phases, showing that the structural phase\ntransition can be decoupled from the metal-insulator transition. Using X-ray\nRaman scattering, we find that screening effects, which are strong in the\ncorundum phase, become weakened at high pressures. Theoretical calculations\nindicate that this can be related to a decrease in coherent quasiparticle\nstrength, suggesting that the high-pressure phase is likely a critical\ncorrelated metal, on the verge of Mott-insulating behavior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Dec 2013 07:44:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-05"}

We conjecture that the convergence is promoted not by the mere\nasymmetry of the potential, but due to ability of the chain to dissociate. In\nother terms, the attractive part of the potential function should approach a\nfinite value as the distance between the neighbors grows. To clarify this\npoint, we study the simplest model of this sort -- a chain of linearly elastic\ndisks with finite diameter. If the distance between the disk centers exceeds\ntheir diameter, the disks cease to interact. Formation of gaps between the\ndisks is the only possible mechanism for scattering of the oscillatory waves.\nHeat conduction in this system turns out to be convergent. Moreover, an\nasymptotic behavior of the heat conduction coefficient for the case of large\ndensities and relatively low temperatures obeys simple Arrhenius-type law. In\nthe limit of low densities, the heat conduction coefficient converges due to\ntriple disk collisions. Numeric observations in both limits are grounded by\nanalytic arguments. In a chain with Lennard-Jones nearest-neighbor potential\nthe heat conductivity also saturates in a thermodynamic limit and the\ncoefficient also scales according to the Arrhenius law for low temperatures.\nThis finding points on a universal role played by the possibility of\ndissociation, as convergence of the heat conduction coefficient is considered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Dec 2013 11:06:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

This is usually achieved by contacting\nferromagnets with metals or semiconductors, in which the relaxation of spins\ndue to spin-orbit coupling limits both the efficiency and the length scale. In\ntopological insulator materials, on the contrary, the spin-orbit coupling is so\nstrong that the spin direction uniquely determines the current direction, which\nallows us to conceive a whole new scheme for spin detection and manipulation.\nNevertheless, even the most basic process, the spin injection into a\ntopological insulator from a ferromagnet, has not yet been demonstrated. Here\nwe report successful spin injection into the surface states of topological\ninsulators by using a spin pumping technique. By measuring the voltage that\nshows up across the samples as a result of spin pumping, we demonstrate that a\nspin-electricity conversion effect takes place in the surface states of\nbulk-insulating topological insulators Bi1.5Sb0.5Te1.7Se1.3 and Sn-doped\nBi2Te2Se. In this process, due to the two-dimensional nature of the surface\nstate, there is no spin current along the perpendicular direction. Hence, the\nmechanism of this phenomenon is different from the inverse spin Hall effect and\neven predicts perfect conversion between spin and electricity at room\ntemperature.

Like birds, these agents travel in open free space\nwhere each of them interacts with the first $n$ neighbors determined by the\ntopological distance with a free boundary condition. Using the same\nprescription for interactions used in the Vicsek model with scalar noise it has\nbeen observed that the flock, in absence of the noise, arrives at a number of\ninteresting stationary states. In the `single sink state' the entire flock\nmaintains perfect cohesion and coherence. In the `cyclic state' every agent\nexecutes a uniform circular motion, and the entire flock executes a pulsating\ndynamics i.e., expands and contracts periodically between a minimum and a\nmaximum size of the flock. When refreshing rate of the interaction zone is the\nfastest, the entire flock gets fragmented into smaller clusters of different\nsizes.
