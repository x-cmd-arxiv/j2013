Many approaches have been proposed in\nliterature to solve this problem, where a node predicts pre-emptively the route\nfailure that occurs with the less received power. However, this approach\nencounters some difficulties, especially in scenario without mobility where\nroute failures may arise. In this paper, we propose an improvement of AODV\nprotocol called LO-PPAODV (Link Quality and MAC-Overhead aware Predictive\nPreemptive AODV). This protocol is based on new metric combine more routing\nmetrics (Link Quality, MAC Overhead) between each node and one hop neighbor.\nAlso we propose a cross-layer networking mechanism to distinguish between both\nsituations, failures due to congestion or mobility, and consequently avoiding\nunnecessary route repair process. The LO-PPAODV was implemented using NS-2. The\nsimulation results show that our approach improves the overall performance of\nthe network. It reduces the average end to end delay, the routing overhead, MAC\nerrors and route errors, and increases the packet delivery fraction of the\nnetwork.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Dec 2013 16:10:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-30"}

We use Discrete Element simulations to investigate the effect of\ncontact cohesion on the steady state of dense powders in a slowly sheared\nsplit-bottom Couette cell, which imposes a wide stable shear band. The\nintensity of cohesive forces can be quantified by the {\\em granular Bond\nnumber} ($Bo$), namely the ratio between maximum attractive force and average\nforce due to external compression. We find that the shear banding phenomenon is\nalmost independent of cohesion for Bond numbers $Bo<1$, but for $Bo \\ge 1$\ncohesive forces start to play an important role, as both width and center\nposition of the band increase for $Bo > 1$. Inside the shear band, the mean\nnormal contact force is always independent of cohesion and depends only on the\nconfining stress. In contrast, when the behavior is analyzed focusing on the\neigen-directions of the local strain rate tensor, a dependence on cohesion\nshows up. Forces carried by contacts along the compressive and tensile\ndirections are symmetric about the mean force (larger and smaller\nrespectively), while the force along the third, neutral direction follows the\nmean force. This anisotropy of the force network increases with cohesion, just\nlike the heterogeneity in all (compressive, tensile and neutral) directions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Dec 2013 17:23:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Jul 2014 17:49:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

This is made possible by\na network of backhaul links that connects RUs and CUs and that carries\ncompressed baseband signals. While prior work has focused mostly on single-hop\nbackhaul networks, this paper investigates efficient backhaul compression\nstrategies for the uplink of C-RANs with a general multihop backhaul topology.\nA baseline multiplex-and-forward (MF) scheme is first studied in which each RU\nforwards the bit streams received from the connected RUs without any\nprocessing. It is observed that this strategy may cause significant performance\ndegradation in the presence of a dense deployment of RUs with a well connected\nbackhaul network. To obviate this problem, a scheme is proposed in which each\nRU decompresses the received bit streams and performs linear in-network\nprocessing of the decompressed signals. For both the MF and the\ndecompress-process-and-recompress (DPR) backhaul schemes, the optimal design is\naddressed with the aim of maximizing the sum-rate under the backhaul capacity\nconstraints. Recognizing the significant demands of the optimal solution of the\nDPR scheme in terms of channel state information (CSI) at the RUs,\ndecentralized optimization algorithms are proposed under the assumption of\nlimited CSI at the RUs. Numerical results are provided to compare the\nperformance of the MF and DPR schemes, highlighting the potential advantage of\nin-network processing and the impact of CSI limitations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Dec 2013 17:39:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-30"}

Disordered systems are characterized by a random energy landscape\ndue to heterogeneities, which remains fixed on the time scales of the phenomena\nconsidered. I focus specifically on elastic interfaces in random media, such as\npinned domain walls in ferromagnets containing defects, fluid contact lines on\nrough surfaces, etc. The goal is to understand static properties (e.g. the\nroughness) of such systems, and their dynamics in response to an external\nforce. The interface moves in avalanches, triggered at random points in time,\nseparated by long periods of quiescence. For magnetic domain walls, this\nphenomenon is known as Barkhausen noise. I first study the model of a particle\nin a Brownian random force landscape, applicable to high-dimensional\ninterfaces. Its exact solution for a monotonous, but time-varying driving force\nis obtained. This allows computing the joint distribution of avalanche sizes\nand durations, and their spatial and temporal shape. I then generalize these\nresults to a short-range correlated disorder. Using the functional\nrenormalization group, I compute the universal distributions of avalanche\nsizes, durations, and their average shape as a function of time. The\ncorrections with respect to the Brownian model become important in sufficiently\nlow dimension (e.g. for a crack front in the fracture of a solid). I then\ndiscuss connections to the rough phase of Kardar-Parisi-Zhang nonlinear surface\ngrowth, and an application to the variable-range hopping model of electric\nconductance in a disordered insulator.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Dec 2013 22:30:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-30"}

This analysis is based on a fact of primary importance for this\nproblem: the C II, N II, and O II ions in atmospheres of these stars are\nphotoionized by radiation in the far UV. Observations show that the actual flux\nin this range for hot stars can be considerably higher than theoretical levels;\nthus, overionization of the C II, N II, and O II ions beyond the ionization\ncalculated with the standard model atmospheres occurs in the actual atmospheres\nof these stars. Underestimates in the calculated ionization lead to reduced\nvalues of the C, N, and O abundances. This is confirmed by the observed\ndependence on the effective temperature Teff: the C, N and O abundances tend to\nbe lower with increasing Teff. It is shown that overionization becomes\nsignificant for sufficiently hot stars, namely when Teff>18500 K for the C II\nlines and when Teff>26000 K for the N II and O II lines. The systematic\ndifference in the C, N and O abundances between these relatively hot stars and\nthe cooler B-type MS stars is about 0.2 dex. The relatively cool B-type MS\nstars (Teff<18100 K for C II and Teff<25000 K for N II and O II) yield the\nundistorted C, N and O abundances, and their average values agree very well\nwith modern estimates for the Sun. It is noted that when an alternative method\nbased on examining the ionization balance (e.g., He I-II, C II-III, Ne I-II, Si\nIII-IV) is used to determine the parameters Teff and log g, the overionization\nproblem essentially vanishes; however, this method leads to a systematic\nenhancement in Teff and log g. The overionization problem can be solved by\nshifting to the improved model atmospheres for early B- and late O-type stars\nthat takes their sphericity into account and, possibly, stellar winds and\nmagnetic fields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Dec 2013 10:07:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

Molecular radicals are an exception because their partly filled\norbitals undergo Kondo screening, opening the way to electron passage even at\nzero bias. While that phenomenon has been experimentally demonstrated for\nseveral complex organic radicals, quantitative theoretical predictions have not\nbeen attempted so far. It is therefore an open question whether and to what\nextent an ab initio-based theory is able to make accurate predictions for Kondo\ntemperatures and conductance lineshapes. Choosing nitric oxide NO as a simple\nand exemplary spin 1/2 molecular radical, we present calculations based on a\ncombination of density functional theory and numerical renormalization group\n(DFT+NRG) predicting a zero bias spectral anomaly with a Kondo temperature of\n15 K for NO/Au(111). A scanning tunneling spectroscopy study is subsequently\ncarried out to verify the prediction, and a striking zero bias Kondo anomaly is\nconfirmed, still quite visible at liquid nitrogen temperatures. Comparison\nshows that the experimental Kondo temperature of about 43 K is larger than the\ntheoretical one, while the inverted Fano lineshape implies a strong source of\ninterference not included in the model. These discrepancies are not a surprise,\nproviding in fact an instructive measure of the approximations used in the\nmodeling, which supports and qualifies the viability of the DFT+NRG approach to\nthe prediction of conductance anomalies in larger molecular radicals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Dec 2013 15:42:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-22"}

This restriction is generally called monogamy. However the\nformal quantification of such restriction is only known for some measures of\nentanglement and for two-level systems. The first and broadly known monogamy\nrelation was established by Coffman, Kundu, and Wootters for the square of the\nconcurrence. Since then, it is usually said that the entanglement of formation\nis not monogamous, as it does not obey the same relation. We show here that\ndespite that, the entanglement of formation cannot be freely shared and\ntherefore should be said to be monogamous. Furthermore, the square of the\nentanglement of formation does obey the same relation of the squared\nconcurrence, a fact recently noted for three particles and extended here for N\nparticles. Therefore the entanglement of formation is as monogamous as the\nconcurrence. We also numerically study how the entanglement is distributed in\npure states of three qubits and the relation between the sum of the bipartite\nentanglement and the classical correlation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Dec 2013 15:48:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 2 Apr 2014 13:13:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-03"}

Almost torus\nnetworks consist on the torus network topology where some nodes or edges have\nbeen removed.
