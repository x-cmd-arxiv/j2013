APNs are similar to\nStochastic Petri Nets (SPNs) in as much as they both rely on component-based\nrepresentation of system state space, in contrast to Markov chains that\nexplicitly model the states of an entire system. In both frameworks, so-called\ntokens (denoted as small circles) represent individual entities comprising the\nsystem; however, SPN graphs contain two distinct types of nodes (called places\nand transitions) with transitions serving the purpose of routing tokens among\nplaces. As a result, a pair of place nodes in SPNs can be linked to each other\nonly via a transient stop, a transition node. In contrast, APN graphs link\nplace nodes directly by arcs (transitions), similar to state space diagrams for\nMarkov chains, and separate transition nodes are not needed.\n  Tokens in APN are distinct and have labels that can assume both discrete\nvalues (\"colors\") and continuous values (\"ages\"), both of which can change\nduring simulation. Component interactions are modeled in APNs using triggers,\nwhich are either inhibitors or enablers (the inhibitors' opposites).\nHierarchical construction of APNs rely on using stacks (layers) of submodels\nwith automatically matching color policies. As a result, APNs provide at least\nthe same modeling power as SPNs, but, as demonstrated by means of several\nexamples, the resulting models are often more compact and transparent,\ntherefore facilitating more efficient performance evaluation of complex\nsystems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Dec 2013 16:38:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-11"}

Traditionally such networks were modeled\ndeterministically, but it is now well-established that when reactant copy\nnumbers are small, the random timing of the reactions create internal noise\nthat can significantly affect the macroscopic properties of the system. To\nunderstand the role of noise and quantify its effects, stochastic models are\nnecessary. In the stochastic setting, the population is described by a\nprobability distribution, which evolves according to a set of ordinary\ndifferential equations known as the Chemical Master Equation (CME). This set is\ninfinite in most cases making the CME practically unsolvable. In many\napplications, it is important to determine if the solution of a CME has a\nglobally attracting fixed point. This property is called ergodicity and its\npresence leads to several important insights about the underlying dynamics. The\ngoal of this paper is to present a simple procedure to verify ergodicity in\nstochastic reaction networks. We provide a set of simple linear-algebraic\nconditions which are sufficient for the network to be ergodic. In particular,\nour main condition can be cast as a Linear Feasibility Problem (LFP) which is\nessentially the problem of determining the existence of a vector satisfying\ncertain linear constraints. The inherent scalability of LFPs make our approach\nefficient, even for very large networks.

On the other hand, as particles become larger their inertia affects\ntheir motions, and they move differently than the air. These inertial dynamics\nimpact cloud evolution and ultimately climate prediction, since clouds govern\nthe earth's energy balances. Yet we lack a simple description of the dynamics.\nFalkovich et al. describes theoretically a new dynamical mechanism called the\n\"sling effect\" by which extreme events in the turbulent air cause idealized\ninertial cloud particles to break free from the airflow (Falkovich G, Fouxon A,\nStepanov MG 2002 Nature 419, 151). The sling effect thereafter causes particle\ntrajectories to cross each other within isolated pockets in the flow, which\nincreases the chance of collisions that form larger particles. We combined\nexperimental techniques that allow for precise control of a turbulent flow with\nthree-dimensional tracking of multiple particles at unprecedented resolution.\nIn this way, we could observe both the sling effect and crossing trajectories\nbetween real particles. We isolated the inertial sling dynamics from those\ncaused by turbulent advection by conditionally averaging the data. We found the\ndynamics to be universal in terms of a local Stokes number that quantifies the\nlocal particle velocity gradients. We measured the probability density of this\nquantity, which shows that sharp gradients become more frequent as the global\nStokes number increases. We observed that sharp compressive gradients in the\nairflow initiated the sling effect, and that thereafter gradients in the\nparticle flow ran away and steepened in a way that produced singularities in\nthe flow in finite time. During this process both the fluid motions and gravity\nbecame unimportant. The results underpin a framework for describing a crucial\naspect of inertial particle dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Dec 2013 18:10:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Jan 2014 11:32:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-10"}

The full gradient is used rather than\nthe projected tangential gradient and it is this which distinguishes \\emph{SIF}\nfrom the method of [42]. The second method, \\emph{NBM}, is a narrow band method\nin which the region of integration is a narrow band of width $O(h)$. \\emph{NBM}\nis similar to the method of [13]. but again the full gradient is used in the\ndiscrete weak formulation.

The lack of optical depth variations between\nultraviolet and near-IR wavelengths indicate a lack of micron-sized particles.\nBetween these two regimes, the particle-size distribution is largely unknown. A\ncutoff where the particle-size distribution turns over must exist, but the\nposition and shape of it is not clear from existing studies.\n  Using a series of solar occultations performed by the VIMS instrument\non-board Cassini in the near-infrared, we are able to measure light forward\nscattered by particles in the A and C rings. With a model of diffraction by\nring particles, and the previous radio work as a constraint on the slope of the\nparticle size distribution, we estimate the minimum particle size using a\ntruncated power-law size distribution. The C Ring shows a minimum particle size\nof $4.1^{+3.8}_{-1.3}$ mm, with an assumed power law index of q=3.1 and a\nmaximum particle size of 10 m.\n  The A Ring signal shows a similar level of scattered flux, but modeling is\ncomplicated by the presence of self-gravity wakes and higher optical depths. If\nq<3, our A Ring model requires a minimum particle size below one millimeter (<\n0.34 mm for an assumed q=2.75, or $0.56^{+0.35}_{-0.16}$ mm for a steeper\nq=2.9) to be consistent with VIMS observations. These results might seem to\ncontradict previous optical(Dones et al., 1993) and infrared (French and\nNicholson, 2000) work, which implied that there were few particles in the A\nRing smaller than 1 cm. But, because of the shallow power law, relatively\nlittle optical depth (between 0.03 and 0.16 in extinction, or 0.015 - 0.08 in\nabsorption) is provided by these particles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Dec 2013 19:46:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-11"}

One of the ultimate\ngoals for these tailored media is the ability to control their properties\nin-situ which has led to a whole new branch of tunable and switchable\nmetamaterials.

An emerging consensus\nin this field is that graphs that exhibit heterogeneity in the number of\nconnections between individuals are more conducive to the spread of cooperative\nbehaviours. In this article we show that such a conclusion largely depends on\nthe individual-level interactions that take place. In particular, averaging\npayoffs garnered through game interactions rather than accumulating the payoffs\ncan altogether remove the cooperative advantage of heterogeneous graphs while\nsuch a difference does not affect the outcome on homogeneous structures. In\naddition, the rate at which game interactions occur can alter the evolutionary\noutcome. Less interactions allow heterogeneous graphs to support more\ncooperation than homogeneous graphs, while higher rates of interactions make\nhomogeneous and heterogeneous graphs virtually indistinguishable in their\nability to support cooperation. Most importantly, we show that common measures\nof evolutionary advantage used in homogeneous populations, such as a comparison\nof the fixation probability of a rare mutant to that of the resident type, are\nno longer valid in heterogeneous populations. Heterogeneity causes a bias in\nwhere mutations occur in the population which affects the mutant's fixation\nprobability.

Our results can be\napplied to any situation in cosmology where different species have\nnon-gravitational interactions. In time-dependent backgrounds, such as FLRW,\nthe quadratic action can only be diagonalized at fixed time slices and flavour\nmixing is unavoidable as time flows. In spite of this, the fluid can be\ninterpreted at the level of the linear equations of motion as an ensemble of\nindividual interacting species. We show that interactions lead to anisotropic\nstresses that depend on the mixing terms in the quadratic action for\nperturbations. In addition to the standard entrainment among different\ncomponents, we find a new operator in the effective action that behaves as a\ncosmological constant when it dominates the dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Dec 2013 21:00:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 22 Dec 2013 13:02:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 4 Jun 2014 14:34:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-05"}

At\nthat time both Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO) spacecraft were\nlocated more than 90 degrees from Earth and could observe the CME eruption\ndirectly, with the CME visible on-disk from STEREO-B and off the limb from\nSTEREO-A. Signatures of pressure variations in the corona such as deflected\nstreamers were seen, indicating the presence of a coronal shock associated with\nthis CME eruption. The evolution of the CME and an associated EUV wave were\nstudied using EUV and coronagraph images. It was found that the lateral\nexpansion of the CME low in the corona closely tracked the propagation of the\nEUV wave, with measured velocities of 240+/-19 km/s and 221+/-15 km/s for the\nCME and wave respectively. Solar energetic particles were observed arriving\nfirst at STEREO-A, followed by electrons at the Wind spacecraft at L1, then\nSTEREO-B, and finally protons arriving simultaneously at Wind and STEREO-B. By\ncarrying out velocity-dispersion analysis on the particles arriving at each\nlocation, it was found that energetic particles arriving at STEREO-A were\nreleased first and the release of particles arriving at STEREO-B was delayed by\naround 50 minutes. Analysis of the expansion of the CME to a wider longitude\nindicates that this delay is a result of the time taken for the edge of the CME\nto reach the footpoints of the magnetic-field lines connected to STEREO-B.

Such inference comes about naturally in the study of\ninverse problems of recovering continuous (infinite dimensional) coefficient\nfunctions from ordinary or partial differential equations (ODE, PDE), a problem\nwhich is typically ill-posed. Regularization of these problems using $L^2$\nfunction spaces (Tikhonov regularization) is equivalent to Bayesian\nprobabilistic inference, using a Gaussian prior. The Bayesian interpretation of\ninverse problem regularization is useful since it allows one to quantify and\ncharacterize error and degree of precision in the solution of inverse problems,\nas well as examine assumptions made in solving the problem -- namely whether\nthe subjective choice of regularization is compatible with prior knowledge.\nUsing path-integral formalism, Bayesian inference can be explored through\nvarious perturbative techniques, such as the semiclassical approximation, which\nwe use in this manuscript. Perturbative path-integral approaches, while\noffering alternatives to computational approaches like Markov-Chain-Monte-Carlo\n(MCMC), also provide natural starting points for MCMC methods that can be used\nto refine approximations.\n  In this manuscript, we illustrate a path-integral formulation for inverse\nproblems and demonstrate it on an inverse problem in membrane biophysics as\nwell as inverse problems in potential theories involving the Poisson equation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Dec 2013 21:37:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 21 Dec 2013 04:59:45 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 30 Apr 2014 01:45:25 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 22 Jul 2014 17:55:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-23"}

However, the quantitative details of this energy\nflow have not been assessed for global disk models. In this work we examine the\nenergetics of a well-resolved, three-dimensional, global magnetohydrodynamic\naccretion disk simulation by evaluating statistically-averaged mean-field\nequations for magnetic, kinetic, and internal energy using simulation data. The\nresults reveal that turbulent magnetic (kinetic) energy is primarily injected\nby the correlation between Maxwell (Reynolds) stresses and shear in the (almost\nKeplerian) mean flow, and removed by dissipation. This finding differs from\nprevious work using local (shearing-box) models, which indicated that turbulent\nkinetic energy was primarily sourced from the magnetic energy reservoir.\nLorentz forces provide the bridge between the magnetic and kinetic energy\nreservoirs, converting ~ 1/5 of the total turbulent magnetic power input into\nturbulent kinetic energy. The turbulent energies (both magnetic and kinetic)\nare mainly driven by terms associated with the turbulent fields, with only a\nminor influence from mean magnetic fields. The interaction between mean and\nturbulent fields is most evident in the induction equation, with the mean\nradial magnetic field being strongly influenced by the turbulent electromotive\nforce (EMF). During the quasi-steady turbulent state roughly 2/3 of the\nPoynting flux travels into the corona, with the remainder transporting magnetic\nenergy in the radial direction. In contrast to previous studies, the\nstress-related part of the Poynting flux is found to dominate, which may have\nimportant implications for \"reflection\" models of Seyfert galaxy coronae that\ntypically invoke a picture of buoyant rising of magnetic flux tubes via\nadvection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Dec 2013 00:41:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

The second is\nthat computation of the optimal step-size requires centralized computations,\nwhich hinders a fully distributed implementation of the algorithm. In this\npaper, the first issue is addressed by providing a tighter characterization of\nthe dual function than what has previously been reported in the literature.\nThen a distributed and a parallel algorithm are presented in which the provided\ndual function approximation is minimized in each step.

These problems are notorious for the\nexistence of huge gaps between the known algorithmic results and NP-hardness\nresults. Our algorithm is based on rounding semidefinite programs from the\nLasserre hierarchy, and the analysis uses bounds for low-rank approximations of\na matrix in Frobenius norm using columns of the matrix.\n  For all the above graph problems, we give an algorithm running in time\n$n^{O(r/\\epsilon^2)}$ with approximation ratio\n$\\frac{1+\\epsilon}{\\min\\{1,\\lambda_r\\}}$, where $\\lambda_r$ is the $r$'th\nsmallest eigenvalue of the normalized graph Laplacian $\\mathcal{L}$. In the\ncase of graph bisection and small set expansion, the number of vertices in the\ncut is within lower-order terms of the stipulated bound.

However, how and why the torque varies still remains controversial,\nwhich is a major issue in understanding neutron stars. Many pulsars have been\nobserved with significant long-term changes of their spin-down rates modulated\nby quasi-periodic oscillations. Applying the phenomenological model of pulsar\ntiming noise we developed recently to the observed precise pulsar timing data\nof isolated neutron stars, here we show that the observed long-term evolutions\nof their spin-down rates and quasi-periodic modulations can be explained by\nHall effects in their crusts. Therefore the evolution of their crustal magnetic\nfields, rather than that in their cores, dominates the observed long term\nspin-down evolution of these young pulsars. Understanding of the nature of\npulsar timing noise not only reveals the interior physics of neutron stars, but\nalso allows physical modeling of pulsar spin-down and thus improves the\nsensitivity of gravitational wave detections with pulsars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Dec 2013 07:00:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 Mar 2014 06:09:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-25"}

Traditional\n$k$-means is an iterative algorithm---in each iteration new cluster centers are\ncomputed and each data point is re-assigned to its nearest center. The cluster\nre-assignment step becomes prohibitively expensive when the number of data\npoints and cluster centers are large.\n  In this paper, we propose a novel approximate $k$-means algorithm to greatly\nreduce the computational complexity in the assignment step. Our approach is\nmotivated by the observation that most active points changing their cluster\nassignments at each iteration are located on or near cluster boundaries. The\nidea is to efficiently identify those active points by pre-assembling the data\ninto groups of neighboring points using multiple random spatial partition\ntrees, and to use the neighborhood information to construct a closure for each\ncluster, in such a way only a small number of cluster candidates need to be\nconsidered when assigning a data point to its nearest cluster. Using complexity\nanalysis, image data clustering, and applications to image retrieval, we show\nthat our approach out-performs state-of-the-art approximate $k$-means\nalgorithms in terms of clustering quality and efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Dec 2013 08:02:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-12"}

This structure augments the neighborhood graph with a bridge\ngraph. We propose to exploit Cartesian concatenation to produce a large set of\nvectors, called bridge vectors, from several small sets of subvectors. Each\nbridge vector is connected with a few reference vectors near to it, forming a\nbridge graph. Our approach finds nearest neighbors by simultaneously traversing\nthe neighborhood graph and the bridge graph in the best-first strategy. The\nsuccess of our approach stems from two factors: the exact nearest neighbor\nsearch over a large number of bridge vectors can be done quickly, and the\nreference vectors connected to a bridge (reference) vector near the query are\nalso likely to be near the query. Experimental results on searching over large\nscale datasets (SIFT, GIST and HOG) show that our approach outperforms\nstate-of-the-art ANN search algorithms in terms of efficiency and accuracy.

We show that a\nsemiclassical model for many-boson propagation reproduces coarse-grained\nobservables that were proposed as witnesses of Boson-Sampling. A test based on\nFourier matrices is demonstrated to falsify physically plausible alternatives\nto coherent many-boson propagation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Dec 2013 09:02:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Jul 2014 07:39:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-14"}

This thermo-acoustic system features a complex dynamical\nbehavior. In order to synthesize accurate time-series, we tackle this problem\nfrom a numerical point-of-view, and start by proposing a dedicated solver\ndesigned for dealing with the underlying stiffness, in particular, the retarded\ntime and the discontinuity at the location of the heat source. Stability\nanalysis is performed on the limit of low-amplitude disturbances by means of\nthe projection method proposed by Jarlebring (2008), which alleviates the\nlinearization with respect to the retarded time. The results are then compared\nto the analytical solution of the undamped system, and to Galerkin projection\nmethods commonly used in this setting. This analysis provides insight into the\nconsequences of the various assumptions and simplifications that justify the\nuse of Galerkin expansions based on the eigenmodes of the unheated resonator.\nWe illustrate that due to the presence of a discontinuity in the spatial\ndomain, the eigenmodes in the heated case, predicted by using Galerkin\nexpansion, show spurious oscillations resulting from the Gibbs phenomenon. By\ncomparing the modes of the linear to that of the nonlinear regime, we are able\nto illustrate the mean-flow modulation and frequency switching. Finally,\ntime-series in the fully nonlinear regime, where a limit cycle is established,\nare analyzed and dominant modes are extracted. The analysis of the saturated\nlimit cycles shows the presence of higher frequency modes, which are linearly\nstable but become significant through nonlinear growth of the signal.

We found significant\nvariation of the total flux density at 8 GHz on the time scale of one month by\nthe single-dish monitoring. The total flux density varied by 5.5% in 32 days,\nwhich is comparable to the gamma-ray variability time scale, corresponding to\nthe variability brightness temperature of $7.0 \\times 10^{11}$ K. The source\nconsists of central and southeastern components on the parsec (pc) scale. The\nflux of only the central component decreased in the same way as the total flux\ndensity, indicating that the short-term radio variability, and probably the\ngamma-ray emitting region, is associated with this component. From the VLBI\nobservations we obtained the brightness temperatures of greater than $(5.2 \\pm\n0.3) \\times 10^{10}$ K, and derived the equipartition Doppler factor of greater\nthan 1.7, the variability Doppler factor of 2.2, and the 8 GHz radio power of\n$10^{24.6}$ W Hz$^{-1}$. Combining them we conclude that acceleration of radio\njets and creation of high-energy particles are ongoing in the central engine,\nand that the apparent very radio-loud feature of the source is due to the\nDoppler-boosting effect, resulting in the intrinsic radio loudness to be an\norder of magnitude smaller than the observed values.

This can be done using fully homomorphic encryption, Yao's garbled\ncircuits or secure multiparty computation. Applications are manifold, most\nprominently the outsourcing of computations to cloud service providers, where\ndata is to be manipulated and processed in full confidentiality. Today, one of\nthe most intensively studied solutions to SFE is fully homomorphic encryption\n(FHE). Ever since the first such systems have been discovered in 2009, and\ndespite much progress, FHE still remains inefficient and difficult to implement\npractically. Similar concerns apply to garbled circuits and (generic)\nmultiparty computation protocols. In this work, we introduce the concept of a\nblind Turing-machine, which uses simple homomorphic encryption (an extension of\nElGamal encryption) to process ciphertexts in the way as standard\nTuring-machines do, thus achieving computability of any function in total\nprivacy. Remarkably, this shows that fully homomorphic encryption is indeed an\noverly strong primitive to do SFE, as group homomorphic encryption with\nequality check is already sufficient. Moreover, the technique is easy to\nimplement and perhaps opens the door to efficient private computations on\nnowadays computing machinery, requiring only simple changes to well-established\ncomputer architectures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Dec 2013 12:52:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-12"}

The resulting physical wavefunction unitarily evolving\nin the time variable introduced within this reduction can then be raised to the\nlevel of the cosmological wavefunction in superspace of 3-metrics. We apply\nthis technique in several simple minisuperspace models and discuss both at\nclassical and quantum level physical reduction in {\\em extrinsic} time -- the\ntime variable determined in terms of extrinsic curvature. Only this extrinsic\ntime gauge can be consistently used in vicinity of turning points and bounces\nwhere the scale factor reaches extremum. Since the 3-metric scale factor is\ncanonically dual to extrinsic time variable, the transition from the physical\nwavefunction to the wavefunction in superspace represents a kind of the\ngeneralized Fourier transform.

Here we\ninvestigate a different method that was reported to yield cuspy triaxial models\nwith virtually no chaos.

Besides,\nstarting with one of the models from the first paper in this series, we\nobtained three different models by rendering its velocity distribution much\nless radially biased (i.e., more isotropic) and by modifying its axial ratios\nthrough adiabatic compression. All three models yielded much higher fractions\nof regular orbits than most of those from our previous work. We conclude that\nit is possible to obtain stable cuspy triaxial models of stellar systems whose\nvelocity distribution is more isotropic than that of the models obtained from\ncold collapses.

Theory and evidence show that older males carry more deleterious\nmutations in their sperm than younger males carry. These mutations are not\nvisible to females choosing mates. Germ-line mutations could oppose preferences\nfor \"good genes.\" Choosy females run the risk that offspring of older males\nwill be no more attractive or healthy than offspring of younger males.\nGerm-line mutations could pose a particular problem when females can only judge\nmale trait size, rather than assessing age directly. I ask whether or not\nfemales will prefer extreme traits, despite reduced offspring survival due to\nage-dependent mutation. I use a quantitative genetic model to examine the\nevolution of female preferences, an age-dependent male trait, and overall\nhealth (\"condition\"). My dynamical equation includes mutation bias that depends\non the generation time of the population. I focus on the case where females\nform preferences for older males because male trait size depends on male age.\nMy findings agree with good genes theory. Females at equilibrium always select\nabove-average males. The trait size preferred by females directly correlates\nwith the direct costs of the preference. Direct costs can accentuate the\nequilibrium preference at a higher rate than mutational parameters. Females can\nalways offset direct costs by mating with older, more ornamented males.\nAge-dependent mutation in condition maintains genetic variation in condition\nand thereby maintains the selective value of female preferences. Rather than\neliminating female preferences, germ-line mutations provide an essential\ningredient in sexual selection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Dec 2013 15:20:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-12"}

This metallicity\ncorrelation implies that outflows from BLRs carry metal-rich gas to NLRs at\ncharacteristic radial distances of ~ 1.0 kiloparsec. This chemical connection\nprovides evidence for a kinetic feedback of the outflows to their hosts. Metals\ntransported into the NLR enhance the cooling of the ISM in this region, leading\nto local star formation after the AGNs turn to narrow line LINERs.

The\nobservational support for the \"maintenance mode\" of feedback is strong (caveat\nthe details); AGN at the centre of massive halos appear to be regulating the\ncooling of hot gas, which could in turn control the levels of future star\nformation (SF) and black hole growth.
