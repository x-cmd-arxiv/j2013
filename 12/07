In\nthis paper we revisit the superradiance-tidal friction analogy within the\ncontext of ultracompact relativistic bodies. We advocate that as long as these\nbodies have non-zero viscosity they should undergo tidal friction that can be\nconstrued as a kind of superradiant scattering from the point of view of the\ndynamics of an orbiting test-body. In addition we consider the presence of\nanisotropic matter, which is required for at least some ultracompact bodies, if\nthey are to sustain a radius very close to the gravitational radius.

This differs from the standard 1D model which treats the waves as\nthe resonant oscillations of just the visible bundle of field lines. Within the\nframework of our 2D model, the two types of oscillations that have been\nobservationally identified, flare-induced waves and \"decayless\" oscillations,\ncan both be attributed to MHD fast waves. The two components of the signal\ndiffer only because of the duration and spatial extent of the source that\ncreates them. The flare-induced waves are generated by strong localized sources\nof short duration, while the decayless background can be excited by a\ncontinuous, stochastic source. Further, the oscillatory signal arising from a\nlocalized, short-duration source can be interpreted as a pattern of\ninterference fringes produced by waves that have traveled diverse routes of\nvarious pathlengths through the waveguide.

Each patient needs exactly one treatment, and can choose from $k$\nhospitals. Hospitals have different costs, which are fully paid by a third\nparty ---the \"payer\". The payer has a fixed budget $B$, and each hospital will\nhave its own waiting time. At equilibrium, each patient will choose his most\npreferred hospital given his intrinsic preferences and the waiting times. The\npayer thus computes the waiting times so that at equilibrium the budget\nconstraint is satisfied and the social welfare is maximized.\n  We first show that the optimization problem is NP-hard, yet if the budget can\nbe relaxed to $(1+\\epsilon)B$ for an arbitrarily small $\\epsilon$, then the\noptimum under budget $B$ can be approximated efficiently. Next, we study the\nendogenous emergence of waiting time from the dynamics between hospitals and\npatients, and show that there is no need for the payer to explicitly enforce\nthe optimal waiting times. Under certain conditions, all he need is to enforce\nthe amount of money he wants to pay to each hospital. The dynamics will always\nconverge to the desired waiting times in finite time.\n  We then go beyond equilibrium solutions and investigate the optimization\nproblem over a much larger class of mechanisms containing the equilibrium ones\nas special cases. With two hospitals, we show that under a natural assumption\non the patients' preference profiles, optimal welfare is in fact attained by\nthe randomized assignment mechanism, which allocates patients to hospitals at\nrandom subject to the budget constraint, but avoids waiting times.\n  Finally, we discuss potential policy implications of our results, as well as\nfollow-up directions and open problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Dec 2013 18:41:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-09"}

The stability theory\nfor these waves is still in its infancy though. The issue has been tackled by\nvarious means. Of course, it is always possible to address stability from the\nspectral point of view. However, the link with nonlinear stability -in fact,\n\\emph{orbital} stability, since we are dealing with space-invariant problems-,\nis far from being straightforward when the best spectral stability we can\nexpect is a \\emph{neutral} one. Indeed, because of the Hamiltonian structure,\nthe spectrum of the linearized equations cannot be bounded away from the\nimaginary axis, even if we manage to deal with the point zero, which is always\npresent because of space invariance. Some other means make a crucial use of the\nunderlying structure. This is clearly the case for the variational approach,\nwhich basically uses the Hamiltonian -or more precisely, a constrained\nfunctional associated with the Hamiltonian and with other conserved quantities-\nas a Lyapunov function. When it works, it is very powerful, since it gives a\nstraight path to orbital stability. An alternative is the modulational\napproach, following the ideas developed by Whitham almost fifty years ago. The\nmain purpose here is to point out a few results, for KdV-like equations and\nsystems, that make the connection between these three approaches: spectral,\nvariational, and modulational.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Dec 2013 19:07:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-09"}

However, ultracold physics is now poised to enter a new\nregime, where far more complex species can be cooled and studied, including\nmagnetic lanthanide atoms and even molecules. For molecules, it has been\nspeculated that a dense forest of resonances in ultracold collision cross\nsections will likely express essentially random fluctuations, much as the\nobserved energy spectra of nuclear scattering do. According to the\nBohigas-Giannoni-Schmit conjecture, these fluctuations would imply chaotic\ndynamics of the underlying classical motion driving the collision. This would\nprovide a paradigm shift in ultracold atomic and molecular physics,\nnecessitating new ways of looking at the fundamental interactions of atoms in\nthis regime, as well as perhaps new chaos-driven states of ultracold matter.

In the specific context of\n2D non-integrable systems possessing ergodic components, it is proposed that,\nin an ergodic region, the pertinent model for describing the spatial\nstatistical features of any typical sigma-type DPP is the two-dimensional\nhomogeneous Poisson point process (herein denoted by P2).

In PGM models and in many models with\nstrongly stabilized moduli, the gravitino mass may be O(100) TeV, whereas\ngaugino masses, generated through anomalies at 1-loop, remain relatively light\nO(1) TeV. In models with scalar mass universality, input scalar masses are\ngenerally very heavy (m_0 \\simeq m_{3/2}) resulting in a mass spectrum\nresembling that in split supersymmetry. However, if one adopts a no-scale or\npartial no-scale structure for the K\\\"ahler manifold, sfermion masses may\nvanish at the tree level. It is usually assumed that the leading order anomaly\nmediated contribution to scalar masses appears at 2-loops. However, there are\nat least two possible sources for 1-loop scalar masses.

A similar spectrum is expected to arise in GUT\nmodels based on E_7/SO(10) where the first two generations of scalars act as\npseudo-Nambu-Goldstone bosons. Explicit breaking of this symmetry by the gauge\ncouplings then generates one-loop masses for the first two generations.

In real life\nthe initiating failures do not occur at once and effort is made replace the\nties eliminated due to the failing nodes. Here we study a dynamic extension of\nthe model of interdependent networks and introduce the possibility of link\nformation with a probability w, called healing, to bridge non-functioning nodes\nand enhance network resilience. A single random node is removed, which may\ninitiate an avalanche. After each removal step healing sets in resulting in a\nnew topology. Then a new node fails and the process continues until the giant\ncomponent disappears either in a catastrophic breakdown or in a smooth\ntransition. Simulation results are presented for square lattices as starting\nnetworks under random attacks of constant intensity. We find that the shift in\nthe position of the breakdown has a power-law scaling as a function of the\nhealing probability with an exponent close to 1. Below a critical healing\nprobability, catastrophic cascades form and the average degree of surviving\nnodes decreases monotonically, while above this value there are no macroscopic\ncascades and the average degree has first an increasing character and decreases\nonly at the very late stage of the process.

The analysis is carried out on a\ntwo-dimensional linear vibronic model where geometric phase (GP) effects\narising from a conical intersection profoundly affect nuclear dynamics. We find\nthat the Wigner-then-Adiabatic (WA) QCL approach captures GP effects, whereas\nthe Adiabatic-then-Wigner (AW) QCL approach does not. Moreover, the Wigner\ntransform in AW-QCL leads to an ill-defined Fourier transform of double-valued\nfunctions. The double-valued character of these functions stems from the\nnontrivial GP of adiabatic electronic states in the presence of a conical\nintersection. In contrast, WA-QCL avoids this issue by starting with the Wigner\ntransform of single-valued quantities of the full problem. Since the WA-QCL\napproach uses solely the adiabatic potentials and non-adiabatic derivative\ncouplings as an input, our results indicate that WA-QCL can capture GP effects\nin general two-state crossing problems using first-principles electronic\nstructure calculations without prior diabatization or introduction of explicit\nphase factors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Dec 2013 21:05:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-12"}

The Fermi\nsurface is found to fractionalize into hotspots and antinodal regions, where\nphysically different gaps are formed. In the phase diagram, this is reflected\nby three transition temperatures for the formation of pseudogap, charge density\nwave, and superconductivity (or quadrupole density wave if a sufficiently\nstrong magnetic field is applied). The charge density wave is characterized by\nmodulations along the bonds of the CuO lattice with wave vectors connecting\npoints of the Fermi surface in the antinodal regions.

This proposal exploits\nmulti-photon driven dissipative processes to encode quantum information in\nlogical bases composed of Schr\\\"odinger cat states. More precisely, we consider\ntwo schemes. In a first scheme, a two-photon driven dissipative process is used\nto stabilize a logical qubit basis of two-component Schr\\\"odinger cat states.\nWhile such a scheme ensures a protection of the logical qubit against the\nphoton dephasing errors, the prominent error channel of single-photon loss\ninduces bit-flip type errors that cannot be corrected. Therefore, we consider a\nsecond scheme based on a four-photon driven dissipative process which leads to\nthe choice of four-component Schr\\\"odinger cat states as the logical qubit.\nSuch a logical qubit can be protected against single-photon loss by continuous\nphoton number parity measurements. Next, applying some specific Hamiltonians,\nwe provide a set of universal quantum gates on the encoded qubits of each of\nthe two schemes. In particular, we illustrate how these operations can be\nrendered fault-tolerant with respect to various decoherence channels of\nparticipating quantum systems. Finally, we also propose experimental schemes\nbased on quantum superconducting circuits and inspired by methods used in\nJosephson parametric amplification, which should allow to achieve these driven\ndissipative processes along with the Hamiltonians ensuring the universal\noperations in an efficient manner.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Dec 2013 21:24:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-12"}

In the highest-strength\nregions, the Zeeman splitting of the 6302-angstrom Fe line becomes wide enough\nfor the triplet nature of the line to be visible by eye in non-polarized light.\nTherefore, a three-line fit to the spectra should, in principle, provide a\nfairly robust measure of the total magnetic-field strength.\n  The code uses the Level-1.5 spec-cube data of the SOLIS VSM 6302-vector\nobservations (specifically the Stokes-I and Stokes-V components) to fit the\nline profiles at each appropriate pixel and calculate the\nmagnetic-field-strength from the line-center separation of the two fit 6302.5\nsigma-components. The 6301.5-angstrom Fe line is also present and fit in the\nVSM 6302-vector data, but it is an anomalous-Zeeman line with a weaker response\nto magnetic fields.

One of the main\nobstacles for using such systems in frequency-division duplex mode, namely the\nhigh overhead for the feedback of channel state information (CSI) to the\ntransmitter, can be mitigated by the recently proposed JSDM (Joint Spatial\nDivision and Multiplexing) algorithm. In this paper we analyze the performance\nof this algorithm in some realistic propagation channels that take into account\nthe partial overlap of the angular spectra from different users, as well as the\nsparsity of mm-Wave channels. We formulate the problem of user grouping for two\ndifferent objectives, namely maximizing spatial multiplexing, and maximizing\ntotal received power, in a graph-theoretic framework. As the resulting problems\nare numerically difficult, we proposed (sub optimum) greedy algorithms as\nefficient solution methods. Numerical examples show that the different\nalgorithms may be superior in different settings.We furthermore develop a new,\n\"degenerate\" version of JSDM that only requires average CSI at the transmitter,\nand thus greatly reduces the computational burden.

We then\ncharacterize the compression rate achievable by schemes that use lossy source\ncodes as a building block, and show that such schemes are, in general,\nsuboptimal. Finally, we tackle the problem of evaluating the minimal\ncompression rate, by converting the problem to a sequence of convex programs\nthat can be solved efficiently.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Dec 2013 06:40:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-10"}

However, GW sky\nlocalization is relatively poor, with expected localization areas of ~10--100\nsquare degrees; this presents a challenge for following up GW signals from\ncompact binary mergers. Prioritizing wide-field follow-ups based on the\nprobability of successful imaging is important when it is impossible to tile\nthe entire gravitational-wave localization region.\n  Galaxy catalogs were effective at narrowing down regions of the sky to search\nin initial attempts at joint GW/EM observations.

Here we present a Chandra X-ray\nabsorption line study of 28 observations on 12 X-ray binaries, with a focus on\nthe NeIX and FeXVII lines. We report the first detections of these lines in a\nsignificant amount of observations. We do not find significant dependence of\nthe line equivalent width on the distance of the XRBs, but we do see weak\ndependence on the source X-ray luminosity. We also find two out of twelve\nselected targets show strong temporal variation of the NeIX absorbers. While\nthe line ratio between the two ion species suggests a temperature consistent\nwith the previous predictions of the ISM, comparing with two theoretical models\nof the ISM shows the observed column densities are significantly higher than\npredictions. On the other hand, photoionzation by the XRBs provides reasonably\ngood fit to the data.

When presented with a set of\ncosmological parameters ($\\Omega_{\\rm m} h^2, \\Omega_{\\rm b} h^2, n_s, w,\n\\sigma_8, \\sum m_\\nu$ and redshift $z$), the trained ANN interpolates the power\nspectrum for $z\\leq2$ at sub-per cent accuracy for modes up to\n$k\\leq0.9\\,h\\textrm{Mpc}^{-1}$. PkANN is faster than computationally expensive\nN-body simulations, yet provides a worst-case error $<1$ per cent fit to the\nnon-linear matter power spectrum deduced through N-body simulations.

Traditionally,\nstylometric features have been successfully employed in various authorship\nanalysis tasks; we extend the traditional feature-set to include some more\ninteresting and effective features for email authorship identification (e.g.\nthe last punctuation mark used in an email, the tendency of an author to use\ncapitalization at the start of an email, or the punctuation after a greeting or\nfarewell). We also included Info Gain feature selection based content features.\nIt is observed that the use of such features in the authorship identification\nprocess has a positive impact on the accuracy of the authorship identification\ntask. We performed experiments to justify our arguments and compared the\nresults with other base line models. Experimental results reveal that the\nproposed CCM-based email authorship identification model, along with the\nproposed feature set, outperforms the state-of-the-art support vector machine\n(SVM)-based models, as well as the models proposed by Iqbal et al.

The\nproposed model attains an accuracy rate of 94% for 10 authors, 89% for 25\nauthors, and 81% for 50 authors, respectively on Enron dataset, while 89.5%\naccuracy has been achieved on authors' constructed real email dataset.

We start with the concept of meta- gene, which specifies the\n\"selfish gene\" of R.Dawkins. Meta- gene encodes the abstract living unity,\nwhich can live relatively independently of the others, and can contain a few\nreal creatures. Each population of living creatures we treat as the wave\nfunction on meta- genes, which module squared is the total number of creatures\nwith the given meta-gene, and the phase is the sum of \"aspirations\" to change\nthe classical states of meta- genes. Each individual life thus becomes one of\npossible outcomes of the virtual quantum measurement of this function. The\nevolution of genomes is described by the unitary operator in the space of\npsi-functions or by Kossovsky-Lindblad equation in the case of open biosystems.\nThis operator contains all the information about specific conditions under\nwhich individuals are, and how \"aspirations\" of their meta- genes may be\nimplemented at the biochemical level. We show the example of quantum\ndescription of the population with two parts of meta-gene: \"wolves\" and \"deer\",\nwhich can be simultaneously in the same abstract living unity. \"Selfish gene\"\nreconciled with the notion of individuality of alive beings that gives\npossibility to consider evolutionary scenarios and their possible physical\ncauses from the single position.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Dec 2013 10:09:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-20"}
