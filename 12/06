Collective diffusion coefficient\nis calculated by the variational approach. Anisotropy of the collective\nparticle motion is analyzed as a function of jump rates and local particle\ndensity. Analytic expressions are compared with the results of Monte Carlo\nsimulations of diffusing particle and dimer mixture. Direction of driven\ndiffusive motion of the same system depends on the jump anisotropy and on the\nvalue of driving force. Driven motion results in the particle and dimer\nseparation when the directions of their easy diffusion axes differ.

Instead of\nobtaining these values via time consuming Monte Carlo simulations, deriving\nclosed form expressions using approximations is crucial. In this work, the\nultimate goal is to derive an approximate average BER expression for a network\ncoded system. While reaching this goal, we firstly consider the cooperative\nsystems' instantaneous BER values that are commonly composed of Q-functions of\nmore than one variables. For these Q-functions, we investigate the convergence\ncharacteristics of the sampling property and generalize this property to\narbitrary functions of multiple variables. Second, we adapt the equivalent\nchannel approach to the network coded scenario for the ease of analysis and\npropose a network decoder with reduced complexity. Finally, by combining these\ntechniques, we show that the obtained closed form expressions well agree with\nsimulation results in a wide SNR range.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Dec 2013 16:05:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-06"}

A key test of this idea\nrequires wide-area, high-resolution maps of dense molecular gas in galaxies to\nexplore how local physical conditions drive dense gas formation, but these\nobservations have been limited because of the faintness of dense gas tracers\nlike HCN and HCO+. Here we demonstrate the power of the Robert C. Byrd Green\nBank Telescope -- the largest single-dish millimeter radio telescope -- for\nmapping dense gas in galaxies by presenting the most sensitive maps yet of HCN\nand HCO+ in the starburst galaxy M82. The HCN and HCO+ in the disk of this\ngalaxy correlates with both recent star formation and more diffuse molecular\ngas and shows kinematics consistent with a rotating torus. The HCO+ emission\nextending to the north and south of the disk is coincident with the outflow\npreviously identified in CO and traces the eastern edge of the hot outflowing\ngas. The central starburst region has a higher ratio of star formation to dense\ngas than the outer regions, pointing to the starburst as a key driver of this\nrelationship. These results establish that the GBT can efficiently map the\ndense molecular gas at 90 GHz in nearby galaxies, a capability that will\nincrease further with the 16 element feed array under construction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Dec 2013 16:07:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

It is caused by the preferred\ncharge states of substitutional Li in the $-1$ state (Li$_{Mg}^{-1}$) and of\ninterstitial Li in the $+1$ state (Li$_i^{+1}$), which indirectly reduce the\nformation energy of V$_H^{+1}$ by up to 0.39 eV depending on the position of\nFermi energy.

The proposed mechanism is\nexplored first in the context of a simple associative learning problem, and\nthen in the context of a hierarchical sensory coding task. The resulting\nqualitative behavior coincides with experimental data from visual cortex.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Dec 2013 17:58:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-06"}

We focus on the transformation between the\nHST/ACS F606W to V-band and F814W to I-band only. The goal is to assess the\nvalidity of the filter transformation equations by Sirianni et al.(2005) with\nrespect to their dependence on metallicity, Horizontal Branch morphology, mass\nand integrated (V-I) colour of the various globular clusters. Such a dependence\nis expected due to the fact that the transformation equations are based on the\nobservations of only one globular cluster, i.e., NGC 2419. Surprisingly, the\ncorrelation between offset and metallicity is found to be weak, with a low\nlevel significance. The correlation between offset and Horizontal Branch\nstructure, as well as total cluster mass is still weaker. Based on the\navailable data we do not find the photometric offset to be linked to multiple\nstellar populations, e.g., as found in NGC 0288, NGC 1851, and NGC 5139. The\nresults of this study show that there are small systematic offsets between the\ntransformed ACS- and observed ground based photometry, and that these are only\nweakly correlated, if at all, with various cluster parameters and their\nunderlying stellar populations. As a result, investigators wishing to transform\nglobular cluster photometry from the Sirianni et al.(2005) ground-based V, I\nsystem onto the Stetson (2000) system simply need to add 0.040 (+/-0.012) to\nthe V-band magnitudes and 0.047 (+/-0.011) to the I-band magnitudes. This in\nturn means that the transformed ACS (V-I) colours match the ground-based values\nfrom Stetson (2000) to within ~0.01 mag.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Dec 2013 18:44:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

From the development stage, improvement\nefforts can be early identified and prioritized. In order to measure the impact\nof industrial process fluctuations on the product performances, the\nconstruction of a failure risk probability estimator is presented in this\narticle. The complex relationship between the process technology and the\nproduct design (non linearities, multi-modal features...) is handled via random\nprocess regression. A random field encodes, for each product configuration, the\navailable information regarding the risk of non-compliance. After a brief\npresentation of the Gaussian model approach, we describe a Bayesian reasoning\navoiding a priori choices of location and scale parameters. The Gaussian\nmixture prior, conditioned by measured (or calculated) data, yields a posterior\ncharacterized by a multivariate Student distribution. The probabilistic nature\nof the model is then operated to derive a failure risk probability, defined as\na random variable. To do this, our approach is to consider as random all\nunknown, inaccessible or fluctuating data. In order to propagate uncertainties,\na fuzzy set approach provides an appropriate framework for the implementation\nof a Bayesian model mimicking expert elicitation. The underlying leitmotiv is\nto insert minimal a priori information in the failure risk model. The relevancy\nof this concept is illustrated with theoretical examples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Dec 2013 19:43:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-06"}

To elucidate the nature of this\nfailure, we compute the energetics of a Co chain on a Cu surface, step, notch,\nand embedded in bulk. The results demonstrate that increasing Co coordination\nextinguishes the dimerization, indicating that the failure of DFT for Co on the\nCu step arises from excessive hybridization, which both weakens the\nferromagnetic correlations that drive the dimerization and increases the\nbonding that opposes dimerization. Additionally, we show that including local\ninteractions via DFT+U or DFT+DMFT does not restore the dimerization for the\nstep-substrate supported wire, though the Co wire does dimerize in DFT+DMFT for\nthe isolated vacuum case.

Such\nrelation can be expressed in terms of a single key parameter, namely the halo\nconcentration. In this work, we examine the median concentration-mass relation,\nc(M), at present time, over more than 20 orders of magnitude in halo mass,\ni.e., from tiny Earth-mass microhalos up to galaxy clusters. The c(M) model\nproposed by Prada et al. (2012), which links the halo concentration with the\nr.m.s. amplitude of matter linear fluctuations, describes remarkably well all\nthe available N-body simulation data down to ~10^(-6) Msun microhalos. A clear\nfattening of the halo concentration-mass relation towards smaller masses is\nobserved, that excludes the commonly adopted power-law c(M) models, and stands\nas a natural prediction for the CDM paradigm. We provide a parametrization for\nthe c(M) relation that works accurately for all halo masses. This feature in\nthe c(M) relation at low masses has decisive consequences e.g. for gamma-ray DM\nsearches, as it implies more modest boosts of the DM annihilation flux due to\nsubstructure, i.e., ~35 for galaxy clusters and ~15 for galaxies like our own,\nas compared to those huge values adopted in the literature that rely on such\npower-law c(M) extrapolations.

Its key ingredient is the\nenergy density functional. In this work, we propose a new parameterization\nUNEDF2 of the Skyrme energy density functional. The functional optimization is\ncarried out using the POUNDerS optimization algorithm within the framework of\nthe Skyrme Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov theory. Compared to the previous\nparameterization UNEDF1, restrictions on the tensor term of the energy density\nhave been lifted, yielding a very general form of the energy density functional\nup to second order in derivatives of the one-body density matrix. In order to\nimpose constraints on all the parameters of the functional, selected data on\nsingle-particle splittings in spherical doubly-magic nuclei have been included\ninto the experimental dataset. The agreement with both bulk and spectroscopic\nnuclear properties achieved by the resulting UNEDF2 parameterization is\ncomparable with UNEDF1. While there is a small improvement on single-particle\nspectra and binding energies of closed shell nuclei, the reproduction of\nfission barriers and fission isomer excitation energies has degraded. As\ncompared to previous UNEDF parameterizations, the parameter confidence interval\nfor UNEDF2 is narrower. In particular, our results overlap well with those\nobtained in previous systematic studies of the spin-orbit and tensor terms.\nUNEDF2 can be viewed as an all-around Skyrme EDF that performs reasonably well\nfor both global nuclear properties and shell structure. However, after adding\nnew data aiming to better constrain the nuclear functional, its quality has\nimproved only marginally. These results suggest that the standard Skyrme energy\ndensity has reached its limits and significant changes to the form of the\nfunctional are needed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Dec 2013 01:10:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 31 Jan 2014 17:20:33 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 28 Apr 2014 14:24:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

One of the most important of these algorithms is particle swarm\noptimization (PSO). PSO is based on the collective intelligence of a swam of\nparticles.

In\nthis work we use PSO to improve the performance of a well-known representation\nmethod of time series data which is the symbolic aggregate approximation (SAX).\nAs with other time series representation methods, SAX results in loss of\ninformation when applied to represent time series. In this paper we use PSO to\npropose a new minimum distance WMD for SAX to remedy this problem. Unlike the\noriginal minimum distance, the new distance sets different weights to different\nsegments of the time series according to their information content. This\nweighted minimum distance enhances the performance of SAX as we show through\nexperiments using different time series datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Dec 2013 02:22:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-09"}

Much work has shown that mRNA abundance is highly\nvariable between closely related species. However, the extent and mechanisms of\npost-transcriptional gene regulatory evolution are largely unknown. Here we\nused ribosome profiling to compare transcript abundance and translation\nefficiency in two closely related yeast species (S. cerevisiae and S.\nparadoxus). By comparing translation regulatory divergence to interspecies\ndifferences in mRNA sequence features, we show that differences in transcript\nleaders and codon bias substantially contribute to divergent translation.\nGlobally, we find that translation regulatory divergence often buffers\nspecies-differences in mRNA abundance, such that ribosome occupancy is more\nconserved than transcript abundance. We used allele-specific ribosome profiling\nin interspecies hybrids to compare the relative contributions of cis- and\ntrans-regulatory divergence to species differences in mRNA abundance and\ntranslation efficiency. The mode of gene regulatory divergence differs for\nthese processes, as trans-regulatory changes play a greater role in divergent\nmRNA abundance than in divergent translation efficiency. Strikingly, most genes\nwith aberrant transcript abundance in F1 hybrids (either over- or\nunder-expressed compared to both parent species) did not exhibit aberrant\nribosome occupancy.

It is\nassumed that the scalar field satisfies the Dirichlet or Neumann boundary\nconditions on the sphere and the plate. As in the $D=3$ case, the formula is of\nTGTG type. One of our main contributions is deriving the translation matrices\nwhich express the change of bases between plane waves and spherical waves for\ngeneral $D$. Using orthogonality of Gegenbauer polynomials, it turns out that\nthe final TGTG formula for the Casimir interaction energy can be simplified to\none that is similar to the $D=3$ case. To illustrate the application of the\nformula, both large separation and small separation asymptotic behaviors of the\nCasimir interaction energy are computed. The large separation leading term is\nproportional to $L^{-D+1}$ if the sphere is imposed with Dirichlet boundary\ncondition, and to $L^{-D-1}$ if the sphere is imposed with Neumann boundary\ncondition, where $L$ is distance from the center of the sphere to the plane.\nFor the small separation asymptotic behavior, it is shown that the leading term\nis equal to the one obtained using proximity force approximation. The\nnext-to-leading order term is also computed using perturbation method. It is\nshown that when the space dimension $D$ is larger than 5, the next-to-leading\norder has sign opposite to the leading order term. Moreover, the ratio of the\nnext-to-leading order term to the leading order term is linear in $D$,\nindicating a larger correction at higher dimensions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Dec 2013 05:14:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

We\nconsider several random divisions of the data into training and testing sets:\nfor instance, for our sample, a total of 70 percent of the data are involved in\ntraining the algorithm, 15 percent are involved in validating the algorithm and\nthe remaining 15 percent are used for blind testing of the resulting\nclassifier.\n  For target selection, we have achieved an acquisition rate for MPGs of 96\npercent and 92 percent for an MPGs threshold of 12+log(O/H)=8.00 and\n12+log(O/H)=8.39, respectively.\n  Running the code takes minutes in most cases under the Matlab 2013a software\nenvironment.\n  The ANN method can easily be extended to any MPGs target selection task when\nthe physical property of the target can be expressed as a quantitative\nvariable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Dec 2013 06:20:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

A number of previous studies have used highly\nsophisticated schemes to calculate opacity models for irregular, porous\nparticles with size much smaller than a wavelength. However, mere growth itself\ncan affect the opacity of the medium in far more significant ways than the\ndetailed compositional and/or structural differences between grain constituents\nonce aggregate particle sizes exceed the relevant wavelengths. This physics is\nnot new; our goal here is to provide a model that provides physical insight and\nis simple to use in the increasing number of protoplanetary nebula evolution,\nand exoplanet atmosphere, models appearing in recent years, yet quantitatively\ncaptures the main radiative properties of mixtures of particles of arbitrary\nsize, porosity, and composition. The model is a simple combination of effective\nmedium theory with small-particle closed-form expressions, combined with\nsuitably chosen transitions to geometric optics behavior. Calculations of\nwavelength-dependent emission and Rosseland mean opacity are shown and compared\nwith Mie theory. The model's fidelity is very good in all comparisons we have\nmade, except in cases involving pure metal particles or monochromatic opacities\nfor solid particles with size comparable to the wavelength.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Dec 2013 08:30:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

Polar coding is based on the so-called channel polarization\nphenomenon induced by a transform over the underlying binary-input channel. The\nchannel polarization is found to be universal in many signal processing\nproblems and has been applied to the coded modulation schemes. In this paper,\nthe channel polarization is further extended to the multiple antenna\ntransmission following a multilevel coding principle. The multiple-input\nmultile-output (MIMO) channel under quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) are\ntransformed into a series of synthesized binary-input channels under a\nthree-stage channel transform. Based on this generalized channel polarization,\nthe proposed space-time polar coded modulation (STPCM) scheme allows a joint\noptimization of the binary polar coding, modulation and MIMO transmission. In\naddition, a practical solution of polar code construction over the fading\nchannels is also provided, where the fading channels are approximated by an\nAWGN channel which shares the same capacity with the original. The simulations\nover the MIMO channel with uncorrelated Rayleigh fast fading show that the\nproposed STPCM scheme can outperform the bit-interleaved turbo coded scheme in\nall the simulated cases, where the latter is adopted in many existing\ncommunication systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Dec 2013 08:32:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 May 2014 02:10:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-20"}

Regional photochemical models have been\ndeveloped to study the impacts of emission reductions on ozone levels. The\nstandard approach is to run the deterministic model under new emission levels\nand attribute the change in ozone concentration to the emission control\nstrategy. However, running the deterministic model requires substantial\ncomputing time, and this approach does not provide a measure of uncertainty for\nthe change in ozone levels. Recently, a reduced form model (RFM) has been\nproposed to approximate the complex model as a simple function of a few\nrelevant inputs. In this paper, we develop a new statistical approach to make\nfull use of the RFM to study the effects of various control strategies on the\nprobability and magnitude of extreme ozone events. We fuse the model output\nwith monitoring data to calibrate the RFM by modeling the conditional\ndistribution of monitoring data given the RFM using a combination of flexible\nsemiparametric quantile regression for the center of the distribution where\ndata are abundant and a parametric extreme value distribution for the tail\nwhere data are sparse. Selected parameters in the conditional distribution are\nallowed to vary by the RFM value and the spatial location. Also, due to the\nsimplicity of the RFM, we are able to embed the RFM in our Bayesian\nhierarchical framework to obtain a full posterior for the model input\nparameters, and propagate this uncertainty to the estimation of the effects of\nthe control strategies. We use the new framework to evaluate three potential\ncontrol strategies, and find that reducing mobile-source emissions has a larger\nimpact than reducing point-source emissions or a combination of several\nemission sources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Dec 2013 09:57:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-09"}

Its restriction to\nmultilinearity has known exponential lower bounds but no nontrivial blackbox\nidentity tests. In this paper we take a step towards designing such\nhitting-sets. We define a notion of distance for multilinear depth-$3$ circuits\n(say, in $n$ variables and $k$ product gates) that measures how far are the\npartitions from a mere refinement. The $1$-distance strictly subsumes the\nset-multilinear model, while $n$-distance captures general multilinear\ndepth-$3$.

Such a situation arises in diverse contexts including voting and matching\nmarkets.\n  Our paper addresses two issues that arise in ordinal mechanism design. To\ndesign social welfare maximizing mechanisms, one needs to be able to\nquantitatively measure the welfare of an outcome which is not clear in the\nordinal setting. Second, since the impossibility results of Gibbard and\nSatterthwaite~\\cite{Gibbard73,Satterthwaite75} force one to move to randomized\nmechanisms, one needs a more nuanced notion of truthfulness.\n  We propose {\\em rank approximation} as a metric for measuring the quality of\nan outcome, which allows us to evaluate mechanisms based on worst-case\nperformance, and {\\em lex-truthfulness} as a notion of truthfulness for\nrandomized ordinal mechanisms. Lex-truthfulness is stronger than notions\nstudied in the literature, and yet flexible enough to admit a rich class of\nmechanisms {\\em circumventing classical impossibility results}. We demonstrate\nthe usefulness of the above notions by devising lex-truthful mechanisms\nachieving good rank-approximation factors, both in the general ordinal setting,\nas well as structured settings such as {\\em (one-sided) matching markets}, and\nits generalizations, {\\em matroid} and {\\em scheduling} markets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Dec 2013 11:38:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 8 Mar 2014 01:33:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-11"}

In particular, samarium hexaboride (SmB$_6$) has drawn much\nattention as it might represent a new class of condensed matter called\ntopological Kondo insulator. Kondo insulators (KI) can have non-trivial Z$_2$\ntopology because the energy gap opens at the Fermi energy ($E_F$) by\nhybridization between an odd- parity renormalized $f$ band and an even- parity\nconduction $d$ band. However, the characteristics of SmB$_6$ deviate from the\nconventional KI because its gap is insensitive to doping and pressure. Thus, it\nis unclear what makes the gap of SmB$_6$ different from that of KI, and how the\nband inversion features occur. In this manuscript, we demonstrate the\nimportance of charge fluctuations in SmB$_6$. Our angle-resolved photoemission\nspectroscopy (ARPES) results reveal that with decreasing temperature the bottom\nof the $d$-$f$ hybridized band at the $\\bar{\\text{X}}$ point gradually shifts\nfrom below to above $E_F$. This shift accompanies a redistribution of spectral\nweight from the upper to the lower quasiparticle band, and reflects the change\nin both carrier density and the number of localized $f$ electron. Moreover,\nbecause this hybridized band is predicted to have odd parity and to induce a\nnon-trivial $Z_{2}$ topology, we compare our ARPES spectra with theoretical\nsurface band structures and find signatures of topological surface states.\nTherefore, our results indicate that SmB$_6$ is a charge fluctuating\ntopological insulator having the odd-parity hybridized band above $E_F$ at the\n$X$ point. This demonstrates that the charge fluctuations do not only drive the\ninsulating bulk phase but also the non-trivial topological phase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Dec 2013 11:47:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 Dec 2013 12:26:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-11"}

Many such tree models\nhave been proposed, from the simple single- tree model to more complex tree\nensembles. Their non-parametric formulation allows for effective and efficient\nmodeling of datasets exhibiting complex non-linear relationships between the\nmodel pre- dictors and observations. However, the mixing behavior of the Markov\nChain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampler is sometimes poor. This is because the\nproposals in the sampler are typically local alterations of the tree structure,\nsuch as the birth/death of leaf nodes, which does not allow for efficient\ntraversal of the model space. This poor mixing can lead to inferential\nproblems, such as under-representing uncertainty. In this paper, we develop\nnovel proposal mechanisms for efficient sampling. The first is a rule\nperturbation proposal while the second we call tree rotation. The perturbation\nproposal can be seen as an efficient variation of the change proposal found in\nexisting literature. The novel tree rotation proposal is simple to implement as\nit only requires local changes to the regression tree structure, yet it\nefficiently traverses disparate regions of the model space along contours of\nequal probability. When combined with the classical birth/death proposal, the\nresulting MCMC sampler exhibits good acceptance rates and properly represents\nmodel uncertainty in the posterior samples. We implement this sampling\nalgorithm in the Bayesian Additive Regression Tree (BART) model and demonstrate\nits effectiveness on a prediction problem from computer experiments and a test\nfunction where structural tree variability is needed to fully explore the\nposterior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Dec 2013 15:38:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-09"}

Cesium vapor is pumped and probed by a resonant\nlaser beam whose circular polarization is modulated synchronously with the spin\nevolution dynamics induced by a static magnetic field. The magnetometer is\noperated in a phase-locked loop, and it has an intrinsic sensitivity below\n20fT/\\sqrt(Hz) using a room temperature paraffin-coated cell. We use the\nmagnetometer to monitor magnetic field fluctuations with a sensitivity of\n300fT/\\sqrt(Hz).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Dec 2013 09:32:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

The equation for\nmassless fermions with varying speed is formulated in the 16-component\nfirst-order form. The projection matrix, which is the density matrix,\nextracting solutions to the equation has been obtained. Exact solutions to the\nequation and energy spectrum for a massive neutrino are obtained in the\npresence of background matter. We have considered as subluminal as well as\nsuperluminal propagations of neutrinos. The bounds on the Lorentz invariance\nviolation parameter from astrophysical observations by IceCube, OPERA, MINOS\ncollaborations and by the SN1987A supernova are obtained for superluminal\nneutrinos.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Dec 2013 17:11:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Jan 2014 17:13:17 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 6 Mar 2014 17:06:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-07"}
