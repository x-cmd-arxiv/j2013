It is believed that spontaneous\n'density reconstruction' near the edges of the 2D gas, leads to multiple\ncounter propagating edge channels, being separated from each other by\nincompressible strips. Unavoidable disorder induces inter-channel tunneling;\naccompanied by Coulomb interaction it renormalizes the multiple edge channels\nto a downstream charge mode and upstream neutral edge mode(s), while\nmaintaining the parity requirements (e.g., the heat conductance along the edge)\ndictated by the bulk. Here, we report of highly sensitive shot noise\nmeasurements that revealed unexpected presence of neutral modes in a variety of\nnon-hole-conjugate fractional states. As already reported previously, we did\nnot observe neutral modes in any of the integer states. In addition to the\nupstream neutral edge modes, we were surprised to find also neutral energy\nmodes that propagate through the incompressible bulk. While along the edge,\ndensity reconstruction may account for the edge modes, we are not aware of a\nmodel that can account for the bulk modes. The proliferation of neutral modes,\nin every tested fractional state, changes drastically the accepted picture of\nFQHE states: an insulating bulk and 1D chiral edge channels. The apparent\nubiquitous presence of these energy modes may account for decoherence of\nfractional quasiparticles - preventing observation of coherent interference in\nthe fractional regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Dec 2013 16:26:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

They are also important\nfor representing sunlight observable in the night sky for diverse photometric\nand spectroscopic tasks, besides being natural candidates for harboring\nplanetary systems similar to ours and possibly even life-bearing environments.\nWe report a photometric and spectroscopic survey of solar twin stars within 50\npc of the Sun. Hipparcos absolute magnitudes and (B-V)_Tycho colors were used\nto define a 2 sigma box around the solar values, where 133 stars were\nconsidered. Additional stars resembling the solar UBV colors in a broad sense,\nplus stars present in the lists of Hardorp, were also selected. All objects\nwere ranked by a color-similarity index with respect to the Sun, defined by\nuvby and BV photometry. Moderately high-resolution, high-S/N spectra were used\nfor a subsample of equatorial-southern stars to derive Teff, log g, and [Fe/H]\nwith average internal errors better than 50 K, 0.20 dex, and 0.08 dex,\nrespectively. Ages and masses were estimated from theoretical HR diagrams. The\ncolor-similarity index proved very successful. We identify and rank new\nexcellent solar analogs, which are fit to represent the Sun in the night sky.\nSome of them are faint enough to be of interest for moderately large\ntelescopes. We also identify two stars with near-UV spectra indistinguishable\nfrom the Sun's. We present five new \"probable\" solar twin stars, besides five\nnew \"possible\" twins. Masses and ages for the best solar twin candidates lie\nvery close to the solar values, but chromospheric activity levels range\nsomewhat. We propose that the solar twins be emphasized in the ongoing searches\nfor extra-solar planets and SETI searches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Dec 2013 18:50:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

Moreover, when several algorithms or\nalgorithmic variants are available it is difficult to compare and combine them.\n  In order to alleviate these problems we propose a top-down approach to\nexpress and implement robotics algorithms and families of algorithms so that\nthey are both less dependent on lower-level details and easier to understand\nand combine. This approach goes top-down from the algorithms and shields them\nfrom lower-level details by introducing very high level abstractions atop the\nintermediate abstractions of robotics middleware.

If experts\ndo the segmentation manually with their own medical knowledge, it will be\ntime-consuming. Therefore, researchers propose methods and systems which can do\nthe segmentation automatically and without any interference. In this article,\nan unsupervised automatic method for brain tumor segmentation on MRI images is\npresented. In this method, at first in the pre-processing level, the extra\nparts which are outside the skull and don't have any helpful information are\nremoved and then anisotropic diffusion filter with 8-connected neighborhood is\napplied to the MRI images to remove noise. By applying the fast bounding\nbox(FBB) algorithm, the tumor area is displayed on the MRI image with a\nbounding box and the central part is selected as sample points for training of\na One Class SVM classifier. A database is also provided by the Zanjan MRI\nCenter. The MRI images are related to 10 patients who have brain tumor. 100\nT2-weighted MRI images are used in this study. Experimental results show the\nhigh precision and dependability of the proposed algorithm.

In the optical domain, effects such as\nstrain-induced anisotropic absorption add an appealing functionality to\ngraphene, opening the prospect for atomically thin optical elements. Indeed,\ngraphene is currently one of the notable players in the intense drive towards\nbendable, thin, and portable electronic displays, where its intrinsically\nmetallic, optically transparent, and mechanically robust nature are major\nadvantages. Given that the intrinsic transparency of a graphene monolayer is\n97.7 %, any small, reproducible, controllable, and potentially reversible\nmodulation of transparency can have a significant impact for graphene as a\nviable transparent conducting electrode. Even more so, if the degree of\nmodulation is polarization dependent.

The degree\nof anisotropy is varied by reversible external manipulation of the level of\npre-strain. The magnitude of strain is monitored independently by optical\nabsorption and Raman spectroscopy, and the experimental observations are\nconsistent with the theoretically expected modification of the optical\nconductivity of graphene arising from the strain-induced changes in the\nelectronic dispersion of graphene.

As our\nmain contribution, we settle the two principal open questions proposed in (CSR\n2012). Firstly, we complete the classification of clique templates by proving a\nfull trichotomy for all possible combinations of counting quantifiers and\nclique sizes, placing each case either in P, NP-complete or Pspace-complete.\nThis involves resolution of the cases in which we have the single quantifier\n$\\exists^{\\geq j}$ on the clique $K_{2j}$.

The main thrust of this\nsecond result is the solution of the complexity for the infinite path which we\nprove is a polynomial-time solvable problem. By adapting the algorithm for the\ninfinite path we are then able to solve the problem for finite paths, and then\ntrees and forests.

(2016),\nwe find that there is residual excess emission from the direction of M31 if\nonly the galactic disk as traced by the far infrared emission is considered.\nAdding a point-like source will improve the fitting effectively, although\nadditional slight improvements can be found if an extended component such as a\nuniform disk or two bubbles is added instead. Taking the far infrared disk plus\na point source as the background model, we search for the DM annihilation\nsignals in the data. We find that there is strong degeneracy between the\nemission from the galaxy and that from 10s GeV mass DM annihilation in the main\nhalo with quark final state. However, the required DM annihilation cross\nsection is about $10^{-25}-10^{-24}$ cm$^3$s$^{-1}$, orders of magnitude larger\nthan the constraints from observations of dwarf spheroidal galaxies, indicating\na non-DM origin of the emission. If DM subhalos are taken into account, the\ndegeneracy is broken. When considering the enhancement from DM subhalos, the\nconstraints on DM model parameters are comparable to (or slightly weaker than)\nthose from the population of dwarf spheroidal galaxies.

However, the irregular nature of the solar cycle makes solar activity\npredictions a challenging task. This is best achieved through appropriately\nconstrained solar dynamo simulations and as such the first step towards\npredictions is to understand the underlying physics of the solar dynamo\nmechanism. In Babcock-Leighton type dynamo models, the poloidal field is\ngenerated near the solar surface whereas the toroidal field is generated in the\nsolar interior. Therefore a finite time is necessary for the coupling of the\nspatially segregated source layers of the dynamo. This time delay introduces a\nmemory in the dynamo mechanism which allows forecasting of future solar\nactivity. Here we discuss how this forecasting ability of the solar cycle is\naffected by downward turbulent pumping of magnetic flux. With significant\nturbulent pumping the memory of the dynamo is severely degraded and thus long\nterm prediction of the solar cycle is not possible; only a short term\nprediction of the next cycle peak may be possible based on observational data\nassimilation at the previous cycle minimum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Dec 2013 02:18:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-31"}

In this paper, we\npropose a lightweight, easy-to-use, scalable framework for transforming almost\nany recursive backtracking algorithm into a parallel one. Our framework incurs\nminimal communication overhead and guarantees a load-balancing strategy that is\nimplicit, i.e., does not require any problem-specific knowledge. The key idea\nbehind this framework is the use of an indexed search tree approach that is\noblivious to the problem being solved. We test our framework with parallel\nimplementations of algorithms for the well-known Vertex Cover and Dominating\nSet problems. On sufficiently hard instances, experimental results show linear\nspeedups for thousands of cores, reducing running times from days to just a few\nminutes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Dec 2013 04:50:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-31"}

Given a repeated game with vector payoffs, a\ntarget set $S$ is approachable by a certain player (the agent) if he can ensure\nthat the average payoff vector converges to that set no matter what his\nadversary opponent does. Blackwell provided two equivalent sets of conditions\nfor a convex set to be approachable. The first (primary) condition is a\ngeometric separation condition, while the second (dual) condition requires that\nthe set be {\\em non-excludable}, namely that for every mixed action of the\nopponent there exists a mixed action of the agent (a {\\em response}) such that\nthe resulting payoff vector belongs to $S$.

One of the major challenges in\ndeveloping skyrmion-based devices is the skyrmions' magnetic stability in\nconfined helimagnetic nanostructures. Through a systematic study of equilibrium\nstates, using a full three-dimensional micromagnetic model including\ndemagnetisation effects, we demonstrate that skyrmionic textures are the lowest\nenergy states in helimagnetic thin film nanostructures at zero external\nmagnetic field and in absence of magnetocrystalline anisotropy. We also report\nthe regions of metastability for non-ground state equilibrium configurations.\nWe show that bistable skyrmionic textures undergo hysteretic behaviour between\ntwo energetically equivalent skyrmionic states with different core orientation,\neven in absence of both magnetocrystalline and demagnetisation-based shape\nanisotropies, suggesting the existence of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya-based shape\nanisotropy. Finally, we show that the skyrmionic texture core reversal dynamics\nis facilitated by the Bloch point occurrence and propagation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Dec 2013 09:33:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 Jun 2014 13:19:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 25 Nov 2015 13:07:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-06"}

We also show that $G_\\delta$ can be replaced by any\nother class of the Borel hierarchy, which implies that the additivity of the\n$\\sigma$-ideal of Haar null sets is $\\omega_1$.\n  The definition of a generalised Haar null set is obtained by replacing the\nBorelness of $B$ in the above definition by universal measurability.

The\ncatalogs of asteroid physical observations have also increased, although the\nnumber of objects is still smaller than in the orbital catalogs. We developed a\nnew approach to the asteroid family classification by combining the\nHierarchical Clustering Method (HCM) with a method to add new members to\nexisting families. This procedure makes use of the much larger amount of\ninformation contained in the proper elements catalogs, with respect to\nclassifications using also physical observations for a smaller number of\nasteroids. Our work is based on the large catalog of the high accuracy\nsynthetic proper elements (available from AstDyS). We first identify a number\nof core families; to these we attribute the next layer of smaller objects.\nThen, we remove all the family members from the catalog, and reapply the HCM to\nthe rest. This gives both halo families which extend the core families and new\nindependent families, consisting mainly of small asteroids. These two cases are\ndiscriminated by another step of attribution of new members and by merging\nintersecting families. By using information from absolute magnitudes, we take\nadvantage of the larger size range in some families to analyze their shape in\nthe proper semimajor axis vs. inverse diameter plane. This leads to a new\nmethod to estimate the family age (or ages). The results from the previous\nsteps are then analyzed, using also auxiliary information on physical\nproperties including WISE albedos and SDSS color indexes. This allows to solve\nsome difficult cases of families overlapping in the proper elements space but\ngenerated by different collisional events.

Conversely, if the replication sample\nis sequenced, ACs of SNPs which are novel in the replication tend to have much\nsmaller or opposite signed associations. We explain this by first deriving the\nAC-phenotype association implied by a model of diverse SNP effects, and second\naccounting for the shifted distribution of SNP effects when using a\ncase-control study as a filter for SNP inclusion. In rare diseases, the case\npopulation is depleted of protective SNPs and enriched for deleterious SNPs,\ncreating the above difference in AC associations. This phenomenon is most\nrelevant in re-sequencing for risk prediction in rare diseases with\nheterogeneous rare mutations because it applies to SNPs with MAF near 1 out of\nthe case-control sample size and is exaggerated when SNP log-odds ratios come\nfrom a heavy-tailed distribution.

In\nthis paper we employ the conductance based model of Compte et al. [J\nNeurophysiol 89, 2707] to study the effect of electrical stimulation. The\npopulation response to electrical stimulation depends on the timing of the\nstimulus with respect to the state of the slow oscillation.

Our results agree\nwith experiments in vivo and in vitro that show that sensitivity to stimulation\nis weaker in the up than in the down state. However, we also find that within\nthe up state stimulation leads to a shortening of the up state, or phase\nadvance, whereas during the up-down transition a prolongation of up states is\npossible, resulting in a phase delay. Finally, we compute the phase response\ncurve for the simple mean-field model by Ngo et al.

In addition to the well-known\nsplits/introgressions involving Neanderthal genes into out-of- Africa people,\nor Denisovan genes into Oceanians, a further series of archaic splits and\nhypotheses proposed in Waddell et al. (2011) are considered in detail. These\ninclude signals of Denisovans with something markedly more archaic and possibly\nsomething more archaic into Papuans as well. These are compared and contrasted\nwith some well-advertised introgressions such as Denisovan genes across East\nAsia, archaic genes into San or non-tree mixing between Oceanians, East Asians\nand Europeans. The general result is that these less appreciated and surprising\narchaic splits have just as much or more support in genome sequence data.\nFurther, evaluation confirms the hypothesis that archaic genes are much rarer\non modern X chromosomes, and may even be near totally absent, suggesting strong\nselection against their introgression. Modeling of relative split weights\nallows an inference of the proportion of the genome the Denisovan seems to have\ngotten from an older archaic, and the best estimate is around 2%. Using a mix\nof quantitative and qualitative morphological data and novel phylogenetic\nmethods, robust support is found for multiple distinct middle Pleistocene\nlineages. Of these, fossil hominids such as SH5, Petralona, and Dali, in\nparticular, look like prime candidates for contributing pre-Neanderthal/Modern\narchaic genes to Denisovans, while the Jinniu-Shan fossil looks like the best\ncandidate for a close relative of the Denisovan. That the Papuans might have\nreceived some truly archaic genes appears a good possibility and they might\neven be from Homo erectus.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Dec 2013 15:53:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-31"}

The resulting joint learning task is cast into\na form that lends itself to be efficiently optimized with a recursive variant\nof the alternating direction method of multipliers. We show results on\nsynthetic data and describe the regime of settings where our multi-task\napproach achieves significant improvements over the single task learning\napproach and discuss the implications on applying the fused logistic regression\nin different real world settings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Dec 2013 15:54:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-31"}
