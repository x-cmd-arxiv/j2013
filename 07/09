Experiments\nwith polarized neutrons prove weak magnetic ordering in the V-sublattice of\nSr2VO3FeAs at ~ 45 K with a probable propagation vector q = (1/8,1/8,0). The\nordered moment of ~ 0.1 muB is too small to remove the V-3d bands from the\nFermi level by magnetic exchange splitting, and much smaller than predicted\nfrom a recent LDA+U study. By using DFT calculations with a GGA+EECE functional\nwe recover the typical quasi-nested Fermi-surface even without magnetic moment.\nFrom this we suggest that the V-atoms are in a Mott-state where the electronic\ncorrelations are dominated by on-site Coulomb-repulsion which shifts the V-3d\nstates away from the Fermi energy. Our results are consistent with\nphotoemission data and clearly reveal that Sr2VO3FeAs is a typical\niron-arsenide superconductor with quasi-nested hole- and electron-like Fermi\nsurface sheets, and constitutes no new paradigm.

Because of\nthe inability of any single neuroimaging techniques to cover all aspects at\nonce, there is a growing interest to combine signals from multiple modalities\nin order to benefit from the advantages of each acquisition method. Due to the\ncomplexity and unknown parameterization of any suggested complete model of BOLD\nresponse in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the development of a\nreliable ultimate fusion approach remains difficult. But besides the primary\ngoal of superior temporal and spatial resolution, conjoint analysis of data\nfrom multiple imaging modalities can alternatively be used to segregate neural\ninformation from physiological and acquisition noise. In this paper we suggest\na novel methodology which relies on constructing a quantifiable mapping of data\nfrom one modality (electroencephalography; EEG) into another (fMRI), called\ntransmodal analysis of neural signals (TRANSfusion). TRANSfusion attempts to\nmap neural data embedded within the EEG signal into its reflection in fMRI\ndata. Assessing the mapping performance on unseen data allows to localize brain\nareas where a significant portion of the signal could be reliably\nreconstructed, hence the areas neural activity of which is reflected in both\nEEG and fMRI data. Consecutive analysis of the learnt model allows to localize\nareas associated with specific frequency bands of EEG, or areas functionally\nrelated (connected or coherent) to any given EEG sensor. We demonstrate the\nperformance of TRANSfusion on artificial and real data from an auditory\nexperiment. We further speculate on possible alternative uses: cross-modal data\nfiltering and EEG-driven interpolation of fMRI signals to obtain arbitrarily\nhigh temporal sampling of BOLD.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Jul 2013 16:30:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-09"}

Lock-in can occur both at the\ndecision-making level (before the decision to build) and at the project level\n(after the decision to build) and can influence the extent of overruns in two\nways. The first involves the methodology of calculating cost overruns according\nto the formal decision to build. Due to lock-in, however, the real decision to\nbuild is made much earlier in the decision-making process and the costs\nestimated at that stage are often much lower than those that are estimated at a\nlater stage in the decision-making process, thus increasing cost overruns. The\nsecond way that lock-in can affect cost overruns is through practice. Although\ndecisions about the project (design and implementation) need to be made,\nlock-in can lead to inefficient decisions that involve higher costs. Sunk costs\n(in terms of both time and money), the need for justification, escalating\ncommitment, and inflexibility and the closure of alternatives are indicators of\nlock-in. In this paper, two case studies, of the Betuweroute and the HSL-South\nprojects in the Netherlands, demonstrate the presence of lock-in and its\ninfluence on the extent of cost overruns at both the decision-making and\nproject levels. This suggests that recognition of lock-in as an explanation for\ncost overruns significantly contributes to the understanding of the inadequate\nplanning process of projects and allows development of more appropriate means.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Jul 2013 17:20:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-09"}

For project size, small\nDutch projects have the largest average percentage cost overruns but in terms\nof total overrun, large projects have a larger share. The length of the\nimplementation phase and especially the length of the pre-construction phase\nare important determinants of cost overruns in the Netherlands. With each\nadditional year of pre-construction, percentage cost overrun increases by five\npercentage points. In contrast, the length of the construction phase has hardly\nany influence on cost overruns. This is an important contribution to current\nknowledge about cost overruns, because the period in which projects are most\nprone to cost overruns is narrowed down considerably, at least in the\nNetherlands. This means that period can be focused on to determine the causes\nand cures of overruns.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Jul 2013 17:22:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 24 Jan 2015 14:09:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-27"}

In its\nsimplest form, the gravity integrand is a reduced determinant which is the\nsquare of the Pfaffian in the Yang-Mills integrand. Gauge invariance is\ncompletely manifest as it follows from a simple property of the Pfaffian.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Jul 2013 18:38:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Jul 2013 17:19:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-29"}

In\nanother direction, historical research perceives that the performance of\nheuristic search algorithms, such as A* and IDA*, can be improved by requiring\nthe heuristics to be consistent -- a property satisfied by any perfect\nheuristic. However, a few recent studies show that inconsistent heuristics can\nalso be used to achieve a large improvement in these heuristic search\nalgorithms. These results leave us a natural question: which property of\nheuristics, accuracy or consistency/inconsistency, should we focus on when\nbuilding heuristics? While there are studies on the heuristic accuracy with the\nassumption of consistency, no studies on both the inconsistency and the\naccuracy of heuristics are known to our knowledge.\n  In this study, we investigate the relationship between the inconsistency and\nthe accuracy of heuristics with A* search. Our analytical result reveals a\ncorrelation between these two properties. We then run experiments on the domain\nfor the Knapsack problem with a family of practical heuristics. Our empirical\nresults show that in many cases, the more accurate heuristics also have higher\nlevel of inconsistency and result in fewer node expansions by A*.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Jul 2013 18:53:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-09"}

The main idea is that the ultraviolet divergences that we\nencounter in the quantum field theories of the standard model, when interpreted\nappropriately, have a deep physical significance that leads to new\nrelationships between the physical and bare masses quarks and leptons. This\ninterpretation is based on the assumption of a quantum gravity induced\nultraviolet cutoff at the Planck scale and a novel approach to mass\nrenormalization in which the usual perturbation series for the self-mass of a\nquark or lepton is rearranged and formally summed. Perturbing around the\nformally summed expression leads to self-consistency equations for the physical\nquark and lepton masses with multiple solutions that lie outside the reach of\nconventional perturbation theory. When applied to the standard model at the\nlowest level of approximation, this approach explains how three generations of\ncharged leptons with a mass spectrum and a value of the fine structure constant\nin rough agreement with experiment can emerge from a universal bare mass and\nbare electromagnetic charge. This approach also explains how three generations\nof physical quark doublets (six flavors) can emerge from a universal bare\ndoublet and bare color charge. Finally, it explains the origin of mixing (and\nCP violation) and the absence of flavor-changing neutral currents.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Jul 2013 18:57:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 11 Sep 2014 16:48:26 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 19 Jul 2018 20:33:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-23"}

This nebula seems to yield\nthe first sign of episodic AGN activity still occurring in the remnant, ~220\nMyr after the coalescence of two gas-rich galaxies. Its location and kinematics\nsuggest it belongs to a stream of tidal-tail gas falling back into the remnant.\nIts integrated [O III]_5007 luminosity is 1.4x10^40 erg/s, and its spectrum\nfeatures some high-excitation lines, including He II_4686. In diagnostic line-\nratio diagrams, the nebula lies in the domain of Seyfert galaxies, suggesting\nthat it is photoionized by a source with a power-law spectrum. Yet, a search\nfor AGN activity in NGC 7252 from X-rays to radio wavelengths yields no\ndetection, with the most stringent upper limit set by X-ray observations. The\nupper luminosity limit of L_{2-10 keV,0} < 5x10^39 erg/s estimated for the\nnucleus is ~10^3 times lower than the minimum ionizing luminosity of >5x10^42\nerg/s necessary to excite the nebula. This large discrepancy suggests that the\nnebula is a faint ionization echo excited by a mildly active nucleus that has\ndeclined by ~3 orders of magnitude over the past 20,000-200,000 years. In many\nways this nebula resembles the prototypical `Hanny's Voorwerp' near IC 2497,\nbut its size is 3x smaller and its [O III] luminosity ~100x lower. We propose\nthat it be classified as an extended emission-line region (EELR).

For sufficiently\nlarge on-site inter-species repulsion, when the two species of fermions are\nboth at half-filling, two conventional ($s$-wave) number density waves are\nformed with a $\\pi$-phase difference between them to minimize the inter-species\nrepulsion. Upon moving one species away from half-filling, an unconventional\ndensity wave with $d_{xy}$-wave symmetry emerges. When both species are away\nfrom the vicinity of half-filling, superconducting instabilities dominate. We\npresent results of a functional renormalization-group calculation that maps out\nthe phase diagram at weak couplings. Also, we provide a simple explanation for\nthe emergence of the $d_{xy}$-density wave phase based on a four-patch model.\nWe find a robust and general mechanism for $d_{xy}$-density-wave formation that\nis related to the shape and size of the Fermi surfaces. The density imbalance\nbetween the two species of fermions in the vicinity of half-filling leads to\nphase-space discrepancy for different inter-species Umklapp couplings. Using a\nphase space argument for leading corrections in the one-loop renormalization\ngroup approach to fermions, we show that the phase-space discrepancy in our\nsystem causes opposite flows for the two leading intra-species Umklapp\ncouplings and that this triggers the $d_{xy}$-density-wave instability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Jul 2013 20:00:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 25 Feb 2014 12:19:51 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 11 Jun 2014 19:09:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-15"}

Our\nresults are based on a suite of updated measurements of physical properties of\nthe high-redshift intergalactic medium (IGM), including gas temperatures and\nthe opacity of the IGM to Ly-alpha and ionizing photons. Consistent with\nprevious works, we find a relatively flat hydrogen photoionization rate over 2\n< z < 5, although our measurements are roughly a factor of two higher than the\n2008 values of Faucher-Giguere et al., due primarily to our lower gas\ntemperatures. The ionizing emissivity we derive is also generally higher than\nother recent estimates due to a combination of lower gas temperatures, higher\nionizing opacity, and an accounting of cosmological radiative transfer effects.\nWe find evidence that the emissivity increases from z~3 to 5, reaching ~5\nionizing photons per atom per gigayear at z=4.75 for realistic galaxy spectra.\nWe further find that galaxies must dominate the emissivity near 1 Ryd at z > 4,\nand possibly at all redshifts z > 2.4. Our results suggest that the\nglobally-averaged ionizing \"efficiency\" of star-forming galaxies increases\nsubstantially with redshift over 3.2 < z < 4.75. This trend is consistent with\nthe conclusion often drawn from reionization models that the ionizing\nefficiency of galaxies must be higher during reionization in order for galaxies\nto reionize the IGM by z=6. Our emissivity values at z~5 suggest that ionizing\nphotons may have been a factor of two more abundant during the final stages of\nreionization than previously indicated. The evolution of the ionizing\nemissivity over 2 < z < 5 suggests, moreover, that the steep decline in the\nphotoionization rate from z~5 to 6 may indicate a rapid evolution in the mean\nfree path at z > 5.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Jul 2013 20:24:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 29 Aug 2013 14:10:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

The evolution of a young protostar and its environment is followed\nbased on hydrodynamical models using the thin-disk approximation, coupled with\na stellar evolution code and phase transformations of CO and CO_2. The\naccretion and associated luminosity bursts in our model are caused by disk\ngravitational fragmentation followed by quick migration of the fragments onto\nthe forming protostar.

The typical\nfreeze-out time of the gas-phase CO onto dust grains in the envelope (a few\nkyr) is much longer than the burst duration (100-200 yr).

The critical behavior of high\ncumulants of conserved charge near the QCD critical point, in particular, the\nsign change, is closely related to the appearance of inflection point. We show\nin general how the times of sign change of high cumulants relate to the order\nof derivative.

All receivers overhear the\nsame transmissions. Each receiver may already have some of the packets as side\ninformation, and requests another subset of the packets. This problem is known\nas the index coding problem and can be represented by a bipartite digraph. An\ninteger linear program is developed that provides a lower bound on the minimum\nnumber of transmissions required for any coding algorithm. Conversely, its\nlinear programming relaxation is shown to provide an upper bound that is\nachievable by a simple form of vector linear coding. Thus, the information\ntheoretic optimum is bounded by the integrality gap between the integer program\nand its linear relaxation. In the special case when the digraph has a planar\nstructure, the integrality gap is shown to be zero, so that exact optimality is\nachieved. Finally, for non-planar problems, an enhanced integer program is\nconstructed that provides a smaller integrality gap. The dual of this problem\ncorresponds to a more sophisticated partial clique coding strategy that\ntime-shares between Reed-Solomon erasure codes. This work illuminates the\nrelationship between index coding, duality, and integrality gaps between\ninteger programs and their linear relaxations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Jul 2013 22:55:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 22 Aug 2013 04:29:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-23"}

We call this the blessing of transitivity and it has\nconsequences for both modeling and inference. Extant research suggests that\nstatistical inference for the Stochastic Blockmodel is more difficult when the\nedges are sparse. However, this conclusion is confounded by the fact that the\nasymptotic limit in all of the previous studies is not merely sparse, but also\nnon-transitive. To retain transitivity, the blocks cannot grow faster than the\nexpected degree. Thus, in sparse models, the blocks must remain asymptotically\nsmall. \\n Previous algorithmic research demonstrates that small \"local\"\nclusters are more amenable to computation, visualization, and interpretation\nwhen compared to \"global\" graph partitions. This paper provides the first\nstatistical results that demonstrate how these small transitive clusters are\nalso more amenable to statistical estimation. Theorem 2 shows that a \"local\"\nclustering algorithm can, with high probability, detect a transitive stochastic\nblock of a fixed size (e.g. 30 nodes) embedded in a large graph. The only\nconstraint on the ambient graph is that it is large and sparse--it could be\ngenerated at random or by an adversary--suggesting a theoretical explanation\nfor the robust empirical performance of local clustering algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Jul 2013 23:14:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 Aug 2013 15:26:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-02"}

This class of prominences was first introduced by\nPettit (1932), who studied them over many years. Observations of tornado\nprominences similar to the ones seen by SDO had already been documented by\nSecchi (1877) in his famous \"Le Soleil\". High resolution and high cadence\nmultiwavelength data obtained by SDO reveal that the tornado-like appearance of\nthese prominences is mainly an illusion due to projection effects. We discuss\ntwo different cases where prominences on the limb might appear to have a\ntornado-like behavior. One case of apparent vortical motions in prominence\nspines and barbs arises from the (mostly) 2D counterstreaming plasma motion\nalong the prominence spine and barbs together with oscillations along\nindividual threads. The other case of apparent rotational motion is observed in\nprominence cavities and results from the 3D plasma motion along the writhed\nmagnetic fields inside and along the prominence cavity as seen projected on the\nlimb. Thus, the \"tornado\" impression results either from counterstreaming and\noscillations or from the projection on the plane of the sky of plasma motion\nalong magnetic field lines, rather than from a true vortical motion around an\n(apparent) vertical or horizontal axis. We discuss the link between\ntornado-like prominences, filament barbs, and photospheric vortices at their\nbase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Jul 2013 23:32:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-10"}

Recent works in this area have focused on\nspecific cases of superhydrophobic stripes. Here we provide some theoretical\nresults to guide the optimization of the forward flow and transverse\nhydrodynamic phenomena in a parallel-plate channel with a superhydrophobic\ntrapezoidal texture, varying on scales larger than the channel thickness. The\npermeability of such a thin channel is shown to be equivalent to that of a\nstriped one with greater average slip. The maximization of a transverse flow\nnormally requires largest possible slip at the gas areas, similarly to a\nstriped channel. However, in case of trapezoidal textures with a very small\nfraction of the solid phase this maximum occurs at a finite slip at the gas\nareas. Exact numerical calculations show that our analysis, based on a\nlubrication theory, can also be applied for a larger gap. However, in this case\nit overestimates a permeability of the channel, and underestimates an\nanisotropy of the flow. Our results provide a framework for the rational design\nof superhydrophobic surfaces for microfluidic applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Jul 2013 04:31:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Oct 2013 19:56:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-23"}

Next, as an\nillustration, higher resonance positions of the 2s$^2$ns $^2$S$^e$ series are\ncalculated for all the ions with a maximum of n=25. The excitation energies\ncalculated from this single-determinantal approach are in excellent agreement\nwith the available literature data (for the n=2 intrashell states the deviation\nis within 0.125% and excepting only one case, the same for the resonance series\nis well below 0.50%).

This usually indicates\nmultiple fractal structures of the sample characterized by different size\nscales. The existing models explaining the crossover positions (that is, the\npoints where the power-law scattering exponent changes) involve only one\ncontrast parameter, which depends solely on the ratio of the fractal sizes.\nHere, a model that describes SAS from a multi-phase system with a few contrast\nparameters is described, and it is shown that the crossover position depends on\nthe scattering length density of each phase. The Stuhrmann contrast variation\nmethod is generalized and applied to experimental curves in the vicinity of the\ncrossover point beyond the Guinier region. The contrast variation is applied\nnot to the intensity itself but to the model parameters, which can be found by\nfitting the experimental data with the suggested interpolation formula. The\nmodel supplements the existing two-phase models and gives the simple condition\nof their inapplicability: if the crossover point depends on the contrast then a\ntwo-phase model is not relevant. The developed analysis allows one to answer\nthe qualitative question of whether one fractal `absorbs' another one or they\nare both immersed in a surrounding homogeneous medium like a solvent or solid\nmatrix. The models can be applied to experimental SAS data where the absolute\nvalue of the scattering exponent of the first power-law regime is higher than\nthat of the subsequent second power-law regime, that is, the scattering curve\nis `convex' near the crossover point. As is shown, the crossover position can\nbe very sensitive to contrast variation, which influences significantly the\nlength of the fractal range.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Jul 2013 07:12:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Dec 2013 19:48:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-31"}

Our data suggest that different\nphysical mechanisms concur in shaping and tilting the FP with respect to the\nvirial plane (VP) expectation. In particular, an hybrid solution in which the\nstructure of galaxies and their stellar population are the main contributors to\nthe FP tilt seems to be favoured. We find that the bulk of the tilt should be\nattributed to structural non-homology, while stellar population effects play an\nimportant but less crucial role. Our data indicate that the differential FP\ntilt between the V and K-band is due to a sort of entanglement between\nstructural and stellar population effects, for which the inward steepening of\ncolor profiles (V-K) tends to increase at increasing the stellar mass of ETGs.\nThe same analysis applied to the ATLAS3D and SDSS data in common with WINGS\n(WSDSS throughout the paper) confirms our results, the only remarkable\ndifference being the less important role of the stellar mass-to-light-ratio in\ndetermining the FP tilt. The ATLAS3D data also suggest that the tilt depends as\nwell on the dark matter (DM) fraction and on the rotational contribution to the\nkinetic energy (Vrot/sigma). We show that the global properties of the FP can\nbe understood in terms of the underlying correlation among mass, structure and\nstellar population of ETGs, for which, at increasing the stellar mass, ETGs\nbecome (on average) older and more centrally concentrated. Finally, we show\nthat a Malmquist-like selection effect may mimic a differential evolution of\nthe mass-to-light ratio for galaxies of different masses.

This model shows a characteristic spin\ntexture and carrier density dependence of Rashba spin-orbit coupling through\nthe orbital degree of freedom.

PTF11qcj is located at a distance of dL ~ 124\nMpc. Our observations with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array show that this\nevent is radio-loud: PTF11qcj reached a radio peak luminosity comparable to\nthat of the famous gamma-ray-burst-associated supernova 1998bw (L_{5GHz} ~\n10^{29} erg/s/Hz). PTF11qcj is also detected in X-rays with the Chandra\nobservatory, and in the infrared band with Spitzer. Our multi-wavelength\nanalysis probes the supernova interaction with circumstellar material. The\nradio observations suggest a progenitor mass-loss rate of ~10^{-4} Msun/yr x\n(v_w/1000 km/s), and a velocity of ~(0.3-0.5)c for the fastest moving ejecta\n(at ~10d after explosion). However, these estimates are derived assuming the\nsimplest model of supernova ejecta interacting with a smooth circumstellar\nmaterial characterized by radial power-law density profile, and do not account\nfor possible inhomogeneities in the medium and asphericity of the explosion.\nThe radio light curve shows deviations from such a simple model, as well as a\nre-brightening at late times. The X-ray flux from PTF11qcj is compatible with\nthe high-frequency extrapolation of the radio synchrotron emission (within the\nlarge uncertainties). An IR light echo from pre-existing dust is in agreement\nwith our infrared data. Our analysis of pre-explosion data from the Palomar\nTransient Factory suggests that a precursor eruption of absolute magnitude M_r\n~ -13 mag may have occurred ~ 2.5 yr prior to the supernova explosion. Based on\nour panchromatic follow-up campaign, we conclude that PTF11qcj fits the\nexpectations from the explosion of a Wolf-Rayet star.

The perfect fluid in the form of radiation defines the material\nreference frame. The properties of the averaged scalar field which acts like\nordinary matter are investigated. After averaging over its quantum states, the\nfree scalar field turns into the Weyssenhoff fluid characterized by the energy\ndensity, pressure, and spin of constituent particles. The cases when the\ncontribution of the quantum effects into the gravitational interaction becomes\nsignificant on macroscopic scale are analyzed. It is demonstrated that, unless\nthe whole, at least a part of such matter-energy constituents as dark matter\nand dark energy may have a quantum origin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Jul 2013 09:40:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 Nov 2013 09:25:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-22"}

The magnetic field manifests itself in the form of structures\nof largely different sizes. This thesis concentrates on two types of the\nsmallest known magnetic features: The first part studies the properties of\numbral dots, dot-like bright features in the dark umbra of a sunspot. The\nobtained umbral dot properties provide a remarkable confirmation of the results\nof recent magneto-hydrodynamical simulations. Observations as well as\nsimulations show that umbral dots differ from their surroundings mainly in the\nlowest photospheric layers, where the temperature is enhanced and the magnetic\nfield is weakened. In addition, the interior of the umbral dots displays strong\nupflow velocities which are surrounded by weak downflows. This qualitative\nagreement further strengthens the interpretation of umbral dots as localized\ncolumns of overturning convection. The second part of the thesis investigates\nbright points, which are small-scale brightness enhancements in the darker\nintergranular lanes of the quiet Sun produced by magnetic flux concentrations.\nObservational data obtained by the balloon-borne solar telescope SUNRISE are\nused in this thesis. For the first time contrasts of bright points in the\nimportant ultraviolet spectral range are determined.

Since the EE of each link is non-cancave (which is a non-concave\nfunction over an affine function), characterizing this boundary is difficult.\nTo meet this challenge, we relate this multi-cell MISO system to cognitive\nradio (CR) MISO channels by applying the concept of interference temperature\n(IT), and accordingly transform the EE boundary characterization problem into a\nset of fractional concave programming problems. Then, we apply the fractional\nconcave programming technique to solve these fractional concave problems, and\ncorrespondingly give a parametrization for the EE boundary in terms of IT\nlevels. Based on this characterization, we further present a decentralized\nalgorithm to implement the multi-cell coordinated beamforming, which is shown\nby simulations to achieve the EE Pareto boundary.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Jul 2013 12:30:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-18"}

In this paper we consider a more feasible problem for the\ntransmitter to have eavesdropper's CSI. That is, the fast fading\nmultiple-antenna Gaussian broadcast channels (FMGBC-CM) with confidential\nmessages, where both receivers are legitimate users such that they both are\nwilling to feedback accurate CSI to maintain their secure transmission, and not\nto be eavesdropped by the other.

The\nresult is that in practice our power-expected-posterior (PEP) methodology is\nsufficiently insensitive to the size n* of the training sample, due to PEP's\nunit-information construction, that one may take n* equal to the full-data\nsample size n and dispense with training samples altogether. In this paper we\nfocus on Gaussian linear models and develop our method under two different\nbaseline prior choices: the independence Jeffreys (or reference) prior,\nyielding the J-PEP posterior, and the Zellner g-prior, leading to Z-PEP. We\nfind that, under the reference baseline prior, the asymptotics of PEP Bayes\nfactors are equivalent to those of Schwartz's BIC criterion, ensuring\nconsistency of the PEP approach to model selection. We compare the performance\nof our method, in simulation studies and a real example involving prediction of\nair-pollutant concentrations from meteorological covariates, with that of a\nvariety of previously-defined variants on Bayes factors for objective variable\nselection. Our prior, due to its unit-information structure, leads to a\nvariable-selection procedure that (1) is systematically more parsimonious than\nthe basic EPP with minimal training sample, while sacrificing no desirable\nperformance characteristics to achieve this parsimony; (2) is robust to the\nsize of the training sample, thus enjoying the advantages described above\narising from the avoidance of training samples altogether; and (3) identifies\nmaximum-a-posteriori models that achieve good out-of-sample predictive\nperformance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Jul 2013 13:15:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 May 2014 10:05:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-27"}

In the past the study of\nthe long-term evolution of merger remnants has mostly focussed on collisions\nbetween low-mass stars (up to about 2 Msun) in the context of blue-straggler\nformation. The evolution of collision products of more massive stars has not\nbeen as thoroughly investigated. In this paper we study the long-term evolution\nof a number of stellar mergers formed by the head-on collision of a primary\nstar with a mass of 5-40 Msun with a lower mass star at three points in its\nevolution in order to better understand their evolution.\n  We use smooth particle hydrodynamics (SPH) calculations to model the\ncollision between the stars. The outcome of this calculation is reduced to one\ndimension and imported into a stellar evolution code. We follow the subsequent\nevolution of the collision product through the main sequence at least until the\nonset of helium burning.\n  We find that little hydrogen is mixed into the core of the collision\nproducts, in agreement with previous studies of collisions between low-mass\nstars. For collisions involving evolved stars we find that during the merger\nthe surface nitrogen abundance can be strongly enhanced. The evolution of most\nof the collision products proceeds analogously to that of normal stars with the\nsame mass, but with a larger radius and luminosity. However, the evolution of\ncollision products that form with a hydrogen depleted core is markedly\ndifferent from that of normal stars with the same mass. They undergo a\nlong-lived period of hydrogen shell burning close to the main-sequence band in\nthe Hertzsprung-Russell diagram and spend the initial part of core helium\nburning as compact blue supergiants.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Jul 2013 13:25:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

Molecular dynamics simulations of the\nmodel are being carried out using Graphic-Processor-Units based software in\ntime spans in order of microseconds, and this enables the study of slow\nrelaxation processes characterizing bitumen. This paper focuses on the\nhigh-temperature dynamics as expressed through the mean-square displacement,\nthe stress autocorrelation function, and rotational relaxation. The diffusivity\nof the individual molecules changes little as a function of temperature and\nreveals distinct dynamical time scales as a result of the different\nconstituents in the system. Different time scales are also observed for the\nrotational relaxation. The stress autocorrelation function features a slow\nnon-exponential decay for all temperatures studied. From the stress\nautocorrelation function, the shear viscosity and shear modulus are evaluated\nat the highest temperature, showing a viscous response at frequencies below 100\nMHz. The model predictions of viscosity and diffusivities are compared to\nexperimental data, giving reasonable agreement. The model shows that the\nasphaltene, resin and resinous oil tend to form nano-aggregates. The\ncharacteristic dynamical relaxation time of these aggregates is different from\nthe homogeneously distributed parts of the system, leading to strong dynamical\nheterogeneity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Jul 2013 14:20:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-10"}

In the confined\nfluid surface-induced frustration leads to four-fold symmetry breaking in all\nphases (which become two-fold symmetric). Since no director distorsion can\narise in our model by construction, frustration in the director orientation is\nrelaxed by the creation of domain walls (where the director changes by\n$90^{\\circ}$); this configuration is necessary to stabilise periodic phases.\nFor $\\kappa=1$ the crystal becomes stable with commensuration transitions\ntaking place as $H$ is varied.

For trapping and cooling Yb$^{+}$ ions, a frequency stabilized\nlaser is required at 369.95nm to drive the $^{2}S_{1/2}$ $ \\rightarrow $ $\n^{2}P_{1/2}$ cooling transition. Since the cycle is not closed, a 935.18nm\nlaser is needed to drive the $^{2}D_{3/2}$ $\\rightarrow$ $^{3}D_{[3/2]1/2}$\ntransition which is followed by rapid decay to the $^{2}S_{1/2}$ state.

Without pumping, the metastable\n$^{2}D_{3/2}$ level is only sparsely populated and direct absorption of 935nm\nlight is difficult to detect. A resonant 369nm laser is able to significantly\npopulate the $^{2}D_{3/2}$ state due to the coupling between the levels. Fast\nre-pumping to the $^{2}S_{1/2}$ state, by 935nm light, can be detected by\nobserving the change in absorption of the 369nm laser using lock-in detection\nof the photodiode signal. In this way simultaneous locking of two optical\nfrequencies in very different spectral regimes is accomplished. A rate equation\nmodel gives good qualitative agreement with the experimental results.

Even though highly\ndesirable, collecting on-site meteorological measurements can be an expensive,\ntime-consuming, and sometimes a challenging task. In this work, we propose a\ncoupled mesoscale-large-eddy modeling framework to synthetically generate\nsite-specific flow and turbulence data. The workhorses behind our framework are\na state-of-the-art, open-source atmospheric model called the Weather Research\nand Forecasting (WRF) model and a tuning-free large-eddy simulation (LES)\nmodel.\n  Using this coupled framework, we simulate a nighttime stable boundary layer\n(SBL) case from the well-known CASES-99 field campaign. One of the unique\naspects of this work is the usage of a diverse range of observations for\ncharacterization and validation. The coupled models reproduce certain\ncharacteristics of observed low-level jets. They also capture various scaling\nregimes of energy spectra, including the so-called spectral gap. However, the\ncoupled models are unable to capture the intermittent nature of the observed\nsurface fluxes. Lastly, we document and discuss: (i) the tremendous\nspatio-temporal variabilities of observed and modeled SBL flow fields, and (ii)\nthe significant disagreements among different observational platforms. Based on\nthese results, we strongly recommend that future SBL modeling studies consider\nrigorous validation exercises based on multi-sensor/multi-platform datasets.\n  In summary, we believe that the numerical generation of realistic SBL is not\nan impossible task. Without any doubt, there remain several computational and\nfundamental challenges. The present work should be viewed as a first step to\nconfront some of these challenges.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Jul 2013 14:55:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-10"}

Inner dust populations are,\nhowever, still poorly known because of the high contrast and small angular\nseparation with respect to their host star. We aim to determine the level of\nnear-infrared exozodiacal dust emission around a sample of 42 nearby main\nsequence stars with spectral types ranging from A to K and to investigate its\ncorrelation with various stellar parameters and with the presence of cold dust\nbelts. We use high-precision K-band visibilities obtained with the FLUOR\ninterferometer on the shortest baseline of the CHARA array. The calibrated\nvisibilities are compared with the expected visibility of the stellar\nphotosphere to assess whether there is an additional, fully resolved\ncircumstellar emission. Near-infrared circumstellar emission amounting to about\n1% of the stellar flux is detected around 13 of our 42 target stars. Follow-up\nobservations showed that one of them (eps Cep) is associated with a stellar\ncompanion, while another one was detected around what turned out to be a giant\nstar (kap CrB). The remaining 11 excesses found around single main sequence\nstars are most probably associated with hot circumstellar dust, yielding an\noverall occurrence rate of 28+8-6% for our (biased) sample. We show that the\noccurrence rate of bright exozodiacal discs correlates with spectral type,\nK-band excesses being more frequent around A-type stars. It also correlates\nwith the presence of detectable far-infrared excess emission in the case of\nsolar-type stars. This study provides new insight into the phenomenon of bright\nexozodiacal discs, showing that hot dust populations are probably linked to\nouter dust reservoirs in the case of solar-type stars. For A-type stars, no\nclear conclusion can be made regarding the origin of the detected near-infrared\nexcesses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Jul 2013 15:15:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-10"}

We found\nCen X-4 to be highly variable in all energy bands on timescales from days to\nmonths, with the strongest quiescent variability a factor of 22 drop in the\nX-ray count rate in only 4 days. The X-ray, UV and optical (V band) emission\nare correlated on timescales down to less than 110 s. The shape of the\ncorrelation is a power law with index gamma about 0.2-0.6. The X-ray spectrum\nis well fitted by a hydrogen NS atmosphere (kT=59-80 eV) and a power law (with\nspectral index Gamma=1.4-2.0), with the spectral shape remaining constant as\nthe flux varies. Both components vary in tandem, with each responsible for\nabout 50% of the total X-ray flux, implying that they are physically linked. We\nconclude that the X-rays are likely generated by matter accreting down to the\nNS surface. Moreover, based on the short timescale of the correlation, we also\nunambiguously demonstrate that the UV emission can not be due to either thermal\nemission from the stream impact point, or a standard optically thick,\ngeometrically thin disc. The spectral energy distribution shows a small UV\nemitting region, too hot to arise from the accretion disk, that we identified\nas a hot spot on the companion star. Therefore, the UV emission is most likely\nproduced by reprocessing from the companion star, indeed the vertical size of\nthe disc is small and can only reprocess a marginal fraction of the X-ray\nemission.

Furthermore,\nthe topologies generated by these different concepts of open and closed sets\nare investigated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Jul 2013 14:01:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-15"}
