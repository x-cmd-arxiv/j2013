This method takes into account the magnetic field\nconnectivity whereas previous methods were based on photospheric signatures\nonly. This novel method maps the true injection of magnetic helicity in active\nregions. We applied this method for the first time to an observed active\nregion, NOAA 11158, which was the source of intense flaring activity.

While the new connectivity-based method confirms the mixed pattern of\nthe helicity flux in NOAA 11158, it also reveals a different, and more correct,\ndistribution of the helicity injection. This distribution can be important for\nexplaining the likelihood of an eruption from the active region.

The first model is a mathematical program with\nequilibrium constraints (MPEC), which ensures that each participant is either\nperfectly happy or his bid is rejected.

A very elegant algorithm for this problem has been given by\nAndersen and Lang [AL08] and requires solving a small number of\nsingle-commodity maximum flow computations over the whole graph G. In this\npaper, we introduce LocalImprove, the first cut-improvement algorithm that is\nlocal, i.e. that runs in time dependent on the size of the input set A rather\nthan on the size of the entire graph. Moreover, LocalImprove achieves this\nlocal behaviour while essentially matching the same theoretical guarantee as\nthe global algorithm of Andersen and Lang.\n  The main application of LocalImprove is to the design of better\nlocal-graph-partitioning algorithms. All previously known local algorithms for\ngraph partitioning are random-walk based and can only guarantee an output\nconductance of O(\\sqrt{OPT}) when the target set has conductance OPT \\in [0,1].\nVery recently, Zhu, Lattanzi and Mirrokni [ZLM13] improved this to O(OPT /\n\\sqrt{CONN}) where the internal connectivity parameter CONN \\in [0,1] is\ndefined as the reciprocal of the mixing time of the random walk over the graph\ninduced by the target set. In this work, we show how to use LocalImprove to\nobtain a constant approximation O(OPT) as long as CONN/OPT = Omega(1). This\nyields the first flow-based algorithm. Moreover, its performance strictly\noutperforms the ones based on random walks and surprisingly matches that of the\nbest known global algorithm, which is SDP-based, in this parameter regime\n[MMV12].\n  Finally, our results show that spectral methods are not the only viable\napproach to the construction of local graph partitioning algorithm and open\ndoor to the study of algorithms with even better approximation and locality\nguarantees.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Jul 2013 17:04:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 13 Oct 2013 19:44:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-07"}

To address this, we\nstudy the impulsive X-ray and UV emission during the eruptive flare of 2011\nJune 7 utilising X-ray imaging from RHESSI and UV 1700A imaging from SDO/AIA.\nThis event is associated with quasi-periodic pulsations in X-ray and possibly\nUV emission, as well as substantial parallel and perpendicular motion of the\nhard X-ray footpoints.\n  The motion of the footpoints parallel to the flare ribbons is unusual; it is\nshown to reverse direction on at least two occasions. However, there is no\nassociated short-timescale motion of the UV bright regions. Additionally, we\nfind that the locations of the brightest X-ray and UV regions are different,\nparticularly during the early portion of the flare impulsive phase, despite\ntheir integrated emission being strongly correlated in time. Correlation\nanalysis of measured flare properties, such as the footpoint separation, flare\nshear, photospheric magnetic field and coronal reconnection rate, reveals that\n- in the impulsive phase - the 25 - 50 keV hard X-ray flux is only weakly\ncorrelated with these properties, in contrast to previous studies.\n  We characterise this event in terms of long-term behaviour, where the X-ray\nnonthermal, thermal, and UV emission sources appear temporally and spatially\nconsistent, and short-term behaviour, where the emission sources are\ninconsistent and quasi-periodic pulsations are a dominant feature requiring\nexplanation. We suggest that the short timescale behaviour of hard X-ray\nfootpoints, and the nature of the observed quasi-periodic pulsations, is\ndetermined by fundamental, as-yet unobserved properties of the reconnection\nregion and particle acceleration sites. This presents a challenge for current\nthree-dimensional flare reconnection models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Jul 2013 18:30:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 9 Aug 2013 16:07:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

We show that additional four-mode interactions enter\ninto the analysis at the same order as the three-mode terms previously\nconsidered. We compute these four-mode couplings by finding a volume-preserving\ncoordinate transformation that relates the energy of a tidally deformed star to\nthat of a radially perturbed spherical star. Using this method, we relate the\nfour-mode coupling to three-mode couplings and show that there is a near-exact\ncancellation between the destabilizing effect of the three-mode interactions\nand the stabilizing effect of the four-mode interaction. We then show that the\nequilibrium tide is stable against the quasi-static decay into daughter p- and\ng-modes to leading order. The leading deviation from the quasi-static\napproximation due to orbital motion of the binary is considered; while it may\nslightly spoil the near-cancellation, any resulting instability timescale is at\nleast of order the gravitational-wave inspiral time. We conclude that the\np-/g-mode coupling does not lead to a quasi-static instability, and does not\nimpact the phase evolution of gravitational waves from binary neutron stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Jul 2013 19:51:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Jan 2014 23:29:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-24"}

For example, high-resolution spectroscopy of very\nmetal poor (VMP) stars demonstrates remarkable agreement between the\ndistribution of [Ti/Fe] in the stellar populations of the Milky Way halo (MW)\nand ultra-faint dwarf (UFD) galaxies. In contrast, for the neutron capture (nc)\nabundance ratio distributions [(Sr,Ba)/Fe], the peak of the small UFD sample (6\nstars) exhibits a signicant under-abundance relative to the VMP stars in the\nlarger MW halo sample (~ 300 stars). We present a simple scenario that can\nsimultaneously explain these similarities and differences by assuming: (i) that\nthe MW VMP stars were predominately enriched by a prior generation of stars\nwhich possessed a higher total mass than the prior generation of stars that\nenriched the UFD VMP stars; and (ii) a much stronger mass-dependent yield (MDY)\nfor nc-elements than for the (known) MDY for Ti. Simple statistical tests\ndemonstrate that conditions (i) and (ii) are consistent with the observed\nabundance distributions, albeit without strong constraints on model parameters.\nA comparison of the broad constraints for these nc-MDY with those derived in\nthe literature seems to rule out Ba production from low-mass SNs and affirms\nmodels that primarily generate yields from high-mass SN.

We call this strategy \"gap\ncycling.\"\n  Methods: We carry out theoretical analysis, simulation and experiments to\ncharacterize the signal chain, resulting artifacts, and their elimination for\nSWIFT.\n  Results: Theoretical analysis reveals the mechanism for gap-cycling's\neffectiveness in canceling inter-band crosstalk. We show phantom and in-vivo\nresults demonstrating bulls-eye artifact free images.\n  Conclusion: Gap cycling is an effective method to remove bulls-eye artifact\nresulting from inter-band crosstalk in SWIFT data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Jul 2013 21:29:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-24"}

Interpretation of\ndiffracted starlight is similar to that for sunlight, but emphasizes larger\nparticles. Stellar diffraction profiles are very distinctive, typically being\napproximately flat out to a critical angle followed by gradually steepening\npower-law falloff with slope less steep than -3. Using the relationship between\nthe phase function for diffraction and the average Fourier transform of the\nprojected area of complex ice crystals we show that defining particle size in\nterms of average projected area normal to the propagation direction of the\nstarlight leads to a simple, analytic approximation representing large-particle\ndiffraction that is nearly independent of crystal habit. A similar analytic\napproximation for the diffraction aureole allows it to be separated from the\npoint spread function and the sky background. Multiple scattering is\ndeconvolved using the Hankel transform leading to the diffraction phase\nfunction. Application of constrained numerical inversion to the phase function\nthen yields a solution for the particle size distribution in the range between\n~50 microns and ~400 microns.

The uncertainty in the degree to which radiation-driven winds of hot\nstars might be affected by small inhomogeneities in the density leads to a\ncorresponding uncertainty in the determination of the atmospheric mass loss\nrates from the strength of optical recombination lines. Furthermore, the\noptical recombination lines also react sensitively to even small changes in the\ndensity structure resulting from the (often assumed instead of computed)\nvelocity law of the outflow. This raises the question of how reliable the\nparameter determinations from such lines are.\n  Results. The discrepancy between the optical and the UV analyses is confirmed\nto be the result of a missing consistency between stellar and wind parameters\nin the optical analysis. The influence of the density (velocity field) is of\nthe same order as that of moderate clumping factors. Moderate clumping factors\nleave the UV spectra mostly unaffected, indicating that the influence on the\nionization balance, and thus on the radiative acceleration, is small. Instead\nof the erratic behavior of the clumping factors claimed from the optical\nanalyses, our analysis based on the velocity field computed from radiative\ndriving yields similar clumping factors for all CSPNs. The shock temperatures\nand the ratios of X-ray to bolometric luminosity required to reproduce the\nhighly ionized Ovi line agree with those known from massive O stars, again\nconfirming the similarity of O-type CSPN and massive O star atmospheres.\n  Conclusions. The similarity of the winds of O-type CSPNs and those of massive\nO stars justifies using the same methods based on the dynamics of\nradiation-driven winds in their analysis, thus supporting the earlier result\nthat several of the CSPNs in the sample have near-Chandrasekhar-limit masses\nand may thus be possible single-star progenitors of type Ia supernovae.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Jul 2013 23:54:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-12"}

Ideally this occurs without net charge currents in order to avoid\nenergy dissipation due to Joule heating. To this end the ability to create pure\nspin currents i.e.without net charge transfer is essential. Spin pumping is the\nmost popular approach to generate pure spin currents in metals, semiconductors,\ngraphene, and even organic materials. When the magnetization vector in a\nferromagnet (FM) - normal metal (NM) junction is excited the spin pumping\neffect leads to the injection of pure spin currents in the normal metal. The\npolarization of this spin current is time dependent and contains a very small\ndc component. The dc-component of the injected spin current has been intensely\nstudied in recent years and has given rise to controversial discussions\nconcerning the magnitude the spin Hall angle which is a material dependent\nmeasure of the efficiency of spin to charge conversion . However in contrast to\nthe rather well understood dc component the two orders of magnitude larger ac\ncomponent has escaped experimental detection so far. Here we show that the\nlarge ac component of the spin currents can be detected very efficiently using\nthe inverse spin Hall effect (ISHE). The observed ac-ISHE voltages are one\norder of magnitude larger than the conventional dc-ISHE measured on the same\ndevice. The spectral shape, angular dependence, power scaling behavior and\nabsolute magnitude of the signals are in line with spin pumping and ISHE\neffects. Our results demonstrate that FM-NM junctions are very efficient\nsources of pure spin currents in the GHz frequency range and we believe that\nour result will stimulate the emerging field of ac spintronics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Jul 2013 01:33:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 13 Jul 2013 01:09:44 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 27 Jul 2013 01:22:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-27"}

Besides, most existing schemes are not with\nsatisfactory efficiency due to exponential arithmetic based on Shamir's scheme.\nIn this paper, we explore the property of verifiable secret sharing(VSS)\nschemes with Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT), then propose a secret key\ndistributed storage scheme based on CRT-VSS and trusted computing for MANET.\nSpecifically, we utilize trusted computing technology to solve two existing\ncheating problems in secret sharing area before. After that, we do the analysis\nof homomorphism property with CRT-VSS and design the corresponding\nshares-product sharing scheme with better concision. On such basis, a secure\ndistributed Elliptic Curve-Digital Signature Standard signature (ECC-DSS)\nauthentication scheme based on CRT-VSS scheme and trusted computing is\nproposed. Furthermore, as an important property of authentication scheme, we\ndiscuss the refreshing property of CRT-VSS and do thorough comparisons with\nShamir's scheme. Finally, we provide formal guarantees towards our schemes\nproposed in this paper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Jul 2013 05:35:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-12"}

It requires\na model of species abundance together with a sampling model. We start with a\ndiscrete model of iid stochastic species abundances, each with Gibbs-Poisson\ndistribution. A $k-$sample drawn from the $n-$species abundances vector is the\none obtained while conditioning it on summing to $k$% . We discuss the sampling\nformulae (species occupancy distributions, frequency of frequencies) in this\ncontext. We then develop some aspects of the estimation of $n$ problem from the\nsize $k$ of the sample and the observed value of $P_{n,k}$, the number of\ndistinct sampled species. It is shown that it always makes sense to study these\noccupancy problems from a Gibbs-Poisson abundance model in the context of a\npopulation with infinitely many species. From this extension, a parameter\n$\\gamma $ naturally appears, which is a measure of richness or diversity of\nspecies. We rederive the sampling formulae for a population with infinitely\nmany species, together with the distribution of the number $P_{k}$ of distinct\nsampled species. We investigate the estimation of $\\gamma $ problem from the\nsample size $k$ and the observed value of $P_{k}$. We then exhibit a large\nspecial class of Gibbs-Poisson distributions having the property that sampling\nfrom a discrete abundance model may equivalently be viewed as a sampling\nproblem from a random partition of unity, now in the continuum. When $n$ is\nfinite, this partition may be built upon normalizing $% n$ infinitely divisible\niid positive random variables by its partial sum. It is shown that the sampling\nprocess in the continuum should generically be biased on the total length\nappearing in the latter normalization. A construction with size-biased sampling\nfrom the ranked normalized jumps of a subordinator is also supplied, would the\nproblem under study present infinitely many species.

However, the evolution of portable\nsystems and advanced Deep Sub-Micron fabrication technologies have brought\npower dissipation as another critical design factor. Low power design reduces\ncooling cost and increases reliability especially for high density systems.\nMoreover, it reduces the weight and size of portable devices. The power\ndissipation in CMOS circuits consists of static and dynamic components. Since\ndynamic power is proportional to V2 dd and static power is proportional to Vdd,\nlowering the supply voltage and device dimensions, the transistor threshold\nvoltage also has to be scaled down to achieve the required performance. In case\nof static power, the power is consumed during the steady state condition i.e\nwhen there are no input/output transitions. Static power has two sources: DC\npower and Leakage power. Consecutively to facilitate voltage scaling without\ndisturbing the performance, threshold voltage has to be minimized. Furthermore\nit leads to better noise margins and helps to avoid the hot carrier effects in\nshort channel devices. In this paper we have been proposed the new CMOS library\nfor the complex digital design using scaling the supply voltage and device\ndimensions and also suggest the methods to control the leakage current to\nobtain the minimum power dissipation at optimum value of supply voltage and\ntransistor threshold.

From measured radii and masses, we can infer planetary internal\ncompositions. It has been recently revealed that super-Earths are diverse in\ncomposition. Such a diversity is thought to arise from diversity in volatile\ncontent. The stability of the volatile components is to be examined, because\nhot super-Earths undergo photo-evaporative mass loss. While several studies\ninvestigated the impact of photo-evaporative mass loss on hydrogen-helium\nenvelopes, there are few studies as to the impact on water-vapor envelopes. To\nobtain theoretical prediction to future observations, we also investigate the\nrelationships among masses, radii, and semimajor axes of water-rich\nsub/super-Earths that have undergone photo-evaporative mass loss. We simulate\nthe interior structure and evolution of sub/super-Earths that consist of a\nrocky core surrounded by a water envelope, including mass loss due to the\nstellar XUV-driven energy-limited hydrodynamic escape. We find that the\nphoto-evaporative mass loss has a significant impact on the evolution of hot\nsub/super-Earths. We then derive the threshold planetary mass and radius below\nwhich the planet loses its water envelope completely as a function of the\ninitial water content, and find that there are minimums of the threshold mass\nand radius. We constrain the domain in the parameter space of planetary mass,\nradius, and semimajor axis in which sub/super-Earths never retain water\nenvelopes in 1-10 Gyr. This would provide an essential piece of information for\nunderstanding the origin of close-in low-mass planets. The current\nuncertainties in stellar XUV flux and its heating efficiency, however, prevent\nus from deriving robust conclusions. Nevertheless, it seems to be a robust\nconclusion that Kepler planet candidates contain a significant number of rocky\nsub/super-Earths.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Jul 2013 09:47:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 10 Jan 2014 02:32:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

Spectroscopic analyses to interpret the spectra of the brightest\nsupernovae from the UV to the near-IR provide a powerful tool with great\nastrophysical potential for the determination of the physical state of the\nejecta, their chemical composition, and the SNe distances even at significant\nredshifts.\n  Methods. We report on improvements of computing synthetic spectra for SNIa\nwith respect to i) an improved and sophisticated treatment of thousands of\nstrong lines that interact intricately with the \"pseudo-continuum\" formed\nentirely by Doppler- shifted spectral lines, ii) an improved and expanded\natomic database, and iii) the inclusion of energy deposition within the ejecta.\n  Results. We show that an accelerated lambda iteration procedure we have\ndeveloped for the mutual interaction of strong spectral lines appearing in the\natmospheres of SNeIa solves the longstanding problem of transferring the\nradiative energy from the UV into the optical regime. In detail we discuss\napplications of the diagnostic technique by example of a standard SNIa, where\nthe comparison of calculated and observed spectra revealed that in the early\nphases the consideration of the energy deposition within the spectrum-forming\nregions of the ejecta does not qualitatively alter the shape of the spectra.\n  Conclusions. The results of our investigation lead to an improved\nunderstanding of how the shape of the spectrum changes radically as function of\ndepth in the ejecta, and show how different emergent spectra are formed as a\nresult of the particular physical properties of SNe Ia ejecta and the resulting\npeculiarities in the radiative transfer.

Like most polymers, the latter is quite sensitive\nto thermal aging, which is not without reason, to be one of the main causes of\nthe various types of faults in the polymeric insulation, leading eventually to\na short circuit and fire. On the example of the most common polymer\ninsulator-PVC subjected to preliminary partial thermolysis, simulating the\nprocess of accelerated aging, we for the first time show that in this case as a\nresult of the aging process, the electrical conductivity of PVC can acquire\nabnormal (not obeying Ohm's law) character. In this case, transitions from a\nstate with normal (low) conductivity of PVC into the state with an ab-normally\nhigh conductivity was clearly observed, being spontaneous uncontrollable\nprocess. Es-pecially the large-scale nature of these changes allowing easily\ntransferring polyvinylchloride from a state of typical dielectric (insulator)\nin a class of conductors attracts attention.). Thus, an-other one of the most\nimportant features of a short circuit in the PVC insulation is opened.

We combine domain specific representations of physical science\n(e.g. CML, Chemical Markup Language), MathML formulae and computational\nspecifications (DeXML) to create executable documents which include scientific\ndata and mathematical formulae. These documents preserve the provenance of the\ndata used, and build tight semantic links between components of mathematical\nformulae and domain objects---in effect grounding the mathematical semantics in\nthe scientific domain. The Declaratron takes these specifications and i)\ncarries out entity resolution and decoration to prepare for computation ii)\nuses a MathML execution engine to run calculations over the revised tree iii)\noutputs domain objects and the complete document to give both results and an\nencapsulated history of the computation. A short description of a case study is\ngiven to illustrate how the system can be used. Many scientific problems\nrequire frequent change of the mathematical functional form and the Declaratron\nprovides this without requiring changes to code. Additionally, it supports\nreproducible science, machine indexing and semantic search of computations,\nmakes implicit assumptions visible, and separates domain knowledge from\ncomputational techniques. We believe that the Declaratron could replace much\nconventional procedural code in science.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Jul 2013 12:35:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-12"}

The Keldysh rotation that forms the basis\nof RTQFT is shown to be a phase-space mapping of the quantum system based on\nthe symmetric (Weyl) ordering.

Here we\npresent two examples of these extensions: the introduction of a scalar contact\ninteraction and the relaxation of the distinguishability of the scalars. In\nboth cases new diagrams allow for a full reconstruction of the correct Regge\nlimit on the gravitational side. Both modifications correspond to theories\nobtained by dimensional reduction from higher-dimensional gauge theories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Jul 2013 13:35:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Nov 2013 12:00:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-05"}

In it, each of N agents corresponds to a vertex, which can create edges\nto other vertices at a cost of alpha each, for some parameter alpha. Every edge\ncan be freely used by every vertex, regardless of who paid the creation cost.\nTo reflect the desire to be close to other vertices, each agent's cost function\nis further augmented by the sum total of all (graph theoretic) distances to all\nother vertices.\n  Previous research proved that for many regimes of the (alpha, N) parameter\nspace, the total social cost (sum of all agents' costs) of every Nash\nequilibrium is bounded by at most a constant multiple of the optimal social\ncost.

Its optical\nto near-infrared (550-2500 nm) spectrum reveals several photospheric absorption\nfeatures, such as H{\\alpha}, Ca triplet and CO bandheads but lacks any emission\nlines. The spectral features in the range 8375-8770{\\AA} are used to constrain\nan effective temperature of 5250\\pm250 (early-/mid-G) and a surface gravity of\n2.0\\pm0.3 (supergiant). The spectral energy distribution of CEN34 resembles the\nSED of a high-mass YSO or an evolved star. Moreover, the observed temperature\nand surface gravity are identical for high-mass YSOs and evolved stars. The\nradial velocity relative to LSR (V_LSR) of CEN34 as obtained from various\nphotospheric lines is of the order of -60 km/s and thus distinct from the +25\nkm/s found for several OB stars in the cluster and for the associated molecular\ncloud. The SED modeling yields ~ 10^{-4} M_sun of circumstellar material which\ncontributes only a tiny fraction to the total visual extinction (11 mag). In\nthe case of a YSO, a dynamical ejection process is proposed to explain the\nV_LSR difference between CEN34 and M17. Additionally, to match the temperature\nand luminosity, we speculate that CEN34 had accumulated the bulk of its mass\nwith accretion rate > 4x10^{-3} M_sun/yr in a very short time span (~ 10^3\nyrs), and currently undergoes a phase of gravitational contraction without any\nfurther mass gain. However, all the aforementioned characteristics of CEN34 are\ncompatible with an evolved star of 5-7 M_sun and an age of 50-100 Myrs, most\nlikely a background post-AGB star with a distance between 2.0 kpc and 4.5 kpc.\nWe consider the latter classification as the more likely interpretation.\nFurther discrimination between the two possible scenarios should come from the\nmore strict confinement of CEN34's distance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Jul 2013 14:35:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

The standard formulation of multipole\nself-gravity suffers from two significant sources of error, which we correct in\nthe formulation presented in this article. The first source of error is due to\nthe numerical approximation that effectively places grid cell mass at the\ncentral point of the cell, then computes the gravitational potential at that\npoint, resulting in a convergence failure of the multipole expansion. We\ndescribe a new scheme that avoids this problem by computing gravitational\npotential at cell faces. The second source of error is due to sub-optimal\nchoice of location for the expansion center, which results in angular power at\nhigh multipole $l$ values in the gravitational field, requiring a high --- and\nexpensive --- value of multipole cutoff \\lmax. By introducing a global measure\nof angular power in the gravitational field, we show that the optimal\ncoordinate for the expansion is the square-density-weighted mean location. We\nsubject our new multipole self-gravity algorithm to two rigorous test problems:\nMacLaurin spheroids for which exact analytic solutions are known, and\ncore-collapse supernovae. We show that key observables of the core-collapse\nsimulations, particularly shock expansion, proto-neutron star motion, and\nmomentum conservation, are extremely sensitive to the accuracy of the multipole\ngravity, and the accuracy of their computation is greatly improved by our\nreformulated solver.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Jul 2013 15:03:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 Jul 2013 20:52:48 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 15 Oct 2013 12:46:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

For neutron stars with\nlarge masses, the TBF effect becomes visible and inclusion of the TBF may\nenhance the total neutrino emissivity by about 50% for neutron stars with a\ngiven mass of $M=1.6M_{\\odot}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Jul 2013 15:41:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-12"}

We propose a\nmethodology, inspired by statistical physics, that characterizes a model\nthrough its 'phase diagram' in the space of parameters. Our first motivation is\nto understand the large macro-economic fluctuations observed in the 'Mark I'\nABM. Our major finding is the generic existence of a phase transition between a\n'good economy' where unemployment is low, and a 'bad economy' where\nunemployment is high. We introduce a simpler framework that allows us to show\nthat this transition is robust against many modifications of the model, and is\ngenerically induced by an asymmetry between the rate of hiring and the rate of\nfiring of the firms. The unemployment level remains small until a tipping\npoint, beyond which the economy suddenly collapses. If the parameters are such\nthat the system is close to this transition, any small fluctuation is amplified\nas the system jumps between the two equilibria. We have explored several\nnatural extensions of the model. One is to introduce a bankruptcy threshold,\nlimiting the leverage of firms. This leads to a rich phase diagram with, in\nparticular, a region where acute endogenous crises occur, during which the\nunemployment rate shoots up before the economy can recover. We also introduce\nsimple wage policies. This leads to inflation (in the 'good' phase) or\ndeflation (in the 'bad' phase), but leaves the overall phase diagram of the\nmodel essentially unchanged. We have also started exploring the effect of\nsimple monetary policies that attempt to contain rising unemployment and defang\ncrises. We end the paper with general comments on the usefulness of ABMs to\nmodel macroeconomic phenomena, in particular in view of the time needed to\nreach a steady state that raises the issue of ergodicity in these models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Jul 2013 12:51:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 5 Mar 2014 16:28:23 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 23 Jun 2014 08:27:35 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 20 Aug 2014 08:56:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-30"}
