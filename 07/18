Our search uses the minimal version of the 3-3-1 model, having\nexotic charges for the quarks and new gauge bosons. This model predicts the\nexistence of bileptons as vector particles having one ($V^{\\pm}$) and two\n($Y^{\\pm\\pm}$) units of electric charge.\n  We study the signatures for the production of four leptons by considering the\ncontribution of a pair of bileptons in $p p $ collisions for three energy and\nluminosity regimes at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). We present invariant\nmass and transverse momentum distributions, the total cross section and we\ndetermine the expected number of events for each bilepton type. Finally we\nanalyze the LHC potential for discovering singly and doubly charged vector\nbileptons at 95$%$ C.L..

Indeed, Bastolla et al. introduced a simple measure of network\nnestedness which opened the door to analytical understanding, allowing them to\nconclude that biodiversity is strongly enhanced in highly nested mutualistic\nnetworks. Here, we suggest a slightly refined version of such a measure and go\non to study how it is influenced by the most basic structural properties of\nnetworks, such as degree distribution and degree-degree correlations (i.e.\nassortativity). We find that heterogeneity in the degree has a very strong\ninfluence on nestedness. Once such an influence has been discounted, we find\nthat nestedness is strongly correlated with disassortativity and hence, as\nrandom (neutral) networks have been recently found to be naturally\ndisassortative, they tend to be naturally nested just as the result of chance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Jul 2013 16:18:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 Sep 2013 11:32:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-23"}

We want to study the effect of\nseparation $d$ and incidence angle $\\chi$ on the scattered wave. We have\ndemonstrated that the horizontal compact pair of tubes ($d/R=2$, $\\chi=0$)\noscillate as a single tube when the incident wave is propagating, which gives a\nscattered wave amplitude of about twice that from a single tube. The scattered\namplitude decreases with increasing $d$ when $d$ is about $\\lambda/2\\pi$ where\n$\\lambda$ is the wavelength of the incident wave packet. In this case the\nindividual tubes start to oscillate separately in the manner of near-field\nscattering. When $d$ is about twice of $\\lambda/2\\pi$, scattering from\nindividual tubes reaches the far-field regime, giving rise to coherent\nscattering with an amplitude similar to the case of the compact pair of tubes.\nFor perpendicular incidence ($\\chi=\\pi/2$), the tubes oscillate simultaneously\nwith the incident wave packet. Moreover, simulations show that a compact\ncluster oscillates almost as a single individual small tube and acts more like\na scattering object, while a loose cluster shows multiple-scattering in the\nnear-field and the absorption is largest when $d$ within the cluster is about\n$\\lambda/2\\pi$.

However, it is well-known\nthat least squares (LS) based estimators are highly sensitive to outliers\npresent in the measurement vector leading to a poor performance when the noise\nno longer follows the Gaussian assumption but, instead, is better characterized\nby heavier-than-Gaussian tailed distributions. In this paper, we propose a\nrobust iterative hard Thresholding (IHT) algorithm for reconstructing sparse\nsignals in the presence of impulsive noise. To address this problem, we use a\nLorentzian cost function instead of the $L_2$ cost function employed by the\ntraditional IHT algorithm. We also modify the algorithm to incorporate prior\nsignal information in the recovery process. Specifically, we study the case of\nCS with partially known support. The proposed algorithm is a fast method with\ncomputational load comparable to the LS based IHT, whilst having the advantage\nof robustness against heavy-tailed impulsive noise. Sufficient conditions for\nstability are studied and a reconstruction error bound is derived. We also\nderive sufficient conditions for stable sparse signal recovery with partially\nknown support. Theoretical analysis shows that including prior support\ninformation relaxes the conditions for successful reconstruction. Simulation\nresults demonstrate that the Lorentzian-based IHT algorithm significantly\noutperform commonly employed sparse reconstruction techniques in impulsive\nenvironments, while providing comparable performance in less demanding,\nlight-tailed environments. Numerical results also demonstrate that the\npartially known support inclusion improves the performance of the proposed\nalgorithm, thereby requiring fewer samples to yield an approximate\nreconstruction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Jul 2013 17:07:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-28"}

As a result, the vacuum polarization\ncontains a non-transversal, quadratically divergent term, which arises as an\nartifact of using twisted boundary conditions in a finite volume. In this\narticle, we show how to determine and remove this term from the vacuum\npolarization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Jul 2013 17:08:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 9 Aug 2013 02:02:17 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 18 Oct 2013 18:00:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-30"}

Observations are now made with increasing sophistication from both\nground and space-based instruments, and exoplanets are characterized with\nincreasing precision. There is a class of particularly interesting exoplanets,\nfalling in the habitable zone, which is defined as the area around a star where\nthe planet is capable of supporting liquid water on its surface. Theoretical\ncalculations also suggest that close-in exoplanets are more likely to have\nweaker planetary magnetic fields, especially in case of super earths. Such\nexoplanets are subjected to a high flux of Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCRs) due to\ntheir weak magnetic moments. GCRs are energetic particles of astrophysical\norigin, which strike the planetary atmosphere and produce secondary particles,\nincluding muons, which are highly penetrating. Some of these particles reach\nthe planetary surface and contribute to the radiation dose. Along with the\nmagnetic field, another factor governing the radiation dose is the depth of the\nplanetary atmosphere. The higher the depth of the planetary atmosphere, the\nlower the flux of secondary particles will be on the surface. If the secondary\nparticles are energetic enough, and their flux is sufficiently high, the\nradiation from muons can also impact the sub-surface regions, such as in the\ncase of Mars. If the radiation dose is too high, the chances of sustaining a\nlong-term biosphere on the planet are very low. We explore the dependence of\nthe GCR induced radiation dose on the strength of the planetary magnetic field\nand its atmospheric depth, finding that the latter is the decisive factor for\nthe protection of a planetary biosphere.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Jul 2013 17:11:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 Sep 2013 12:11:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-23"}

The wall consists of\nperiodic stripes, where the charge density varies in one direction. The\nmembrane is in a contact with a bulk reservoir of an electrolyte solution and\nseparated from the wall by a thin film of salt-free liquid. One type of ions\n(small counterions) permeates into the gap and gives rise to a\ndistance-dependent membrane potential, which translates into a repulsive\nelectrostatic disjoining pressure due to an overlap of counterion clouds in the\ngap. To quantify it we use two complementary approaches. First, we propose a\nmean-field theory based on a linearized Poisson-Boltzmann equation and Fourier\nanalysis. These calculations allow us to estimate the effect of a heterogeneous\ncharge pattern at the wall on the induced heterogeneous membrane potential, and\nthe value of the disjoining pressure as a function of the gap. Second, we\nperform Langevin dynamics simulations of the same system with explicit ions.\nThe results of the two approaches are in good agreement with each other at low\nsurface charge and small gap, but differ due to nonlinearity at the higher\ncharge.

The covariant properties of parity involve the\nJordan algebra of anti commutators of the Lorentz group generators which unlike\nthe Lie algebra is not universal.

The SNAIL1/miR-34 double\nnegative feedback loop is responsible for the reversible switch and regulates\nthe initiation of EMT, while the ZEB/miR-200 feedback loop is accountable for\nthe irreversible switch and controls the establishment of the mesenchymal\nstate. Furthermore, an autocrine TGF-\\beta/miR-200 feedback loop makes the\nsecond switch irreversible, modulating the maintenance of EMT. Such coupled\nbistable switches are robust to parameter variation and molecular noise. We\nprovide a mechanistic explanation on multiple experimental observations.

It is\nimportant to understand the details of the process of renormalization in this\ntheory. In more familiar applications of quantum field theory, the dependence\non the external momenta of the dimensionally regulated expression of the\none-loop contribution to a correlator determines the number of counter terms\n(and their forms) required to renormalize it. In this work, it is pointed out\nthat in cosmological perturbation theory, though this still happens, it happens\nin a completely different way such that in the late time limit, the information\nabout the number and forms of counter terms required gets erased. This is to be\ncompared with what happens in spontaneous symmetry breaking where the use of\nfluctuation fields around a chosen vacuum seems to suggest that more counter\nterms shall be needed to renormalize the theory than are actually required. We\nalso comment on how the field strength of curvature perturbation, $\\zeta$,\ncould get renormalized.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Jul 2013 19:19:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Jan 2014 17:08:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-15"}

It leads to mapping the\nmolecular cloud spatial distribution and detecting the embedded clusters with\ntheir characterization in terms of member number and age estimation. We have\nidentified 13 clusters, 2 of which are new discoveries, and we estimate that\nthe total number of young stellar objects in the Rosette ranges between 4000\nand 8000 members. We find that the age distribution of the young clusters is\nnot consistent with a general triggered scenario for the star formation in this\nmolecular cloud. This study proves that the Rosette complex evolution is not\ngoverned by the influence of its OB star population. It suggests that the\nsimple morphological appearance of an active region is not sufficient to\nconclude much about the triggering role in the star formation process. Our\nmethod of constraining the cluster properties using UKIDSS and WISE data has\nproven efficient, and studies of other regions of the galactic plane would\ndefinitely benefit from this approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Jul 2013 20:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Jul 2013 08:04:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

In addition, they also have a distance at which they\nwill become tidally locked and therefore in synchronous rotation with the\nplanet. We have examined the flux phase profile of a simulated, hypothetical\nmoon orbiting at a distant radius around the confirmed exoplanets mu Ara b, HD\n28185 b, BD +14 4559 b, and HD 73534 b. The irradiated flux on a moon at it's\nfurthest, stable distance from the planet achieves it's largest flux gradient,\nwhich places a limit on the flux ranges expected for subsequent (observed)\nmoons closer in orbit to the planet. We have also analyzed the effect of\nplanetary eccentricity on the flux on the moon, examining planets that traverse\nthe habitable zone either fully or partially during their orbit. Looking solely\nat the stellar contributions, we find that moons around planets that are\ntotally within the habitable zone experience thermal equilibrium temperatures\nabove the runaway greenhouse limit, requiring a small heat redistribution\nefficiency. In contrast, exomoons orbiting planets that only spend a fraction\nof their time within the habitable zone require a heat redistribution\nefficiency near 100% in order to achieve temperatures suitable for\nhabitability.\n  Meaning, a planet does not need to spend its entire orbit within the\nhabitable zone in order for the exomoon to be habitable.

While the short-distance behavior of\nthis factor is well understood, little is known about the form of f(rij) at\nlarge rij. In this work we investigate the optimal form of f(r12) on the\nexample of the helium atom and helium-like ions and several well-motivated\nmodels of the wave function. Using the Rayleigh-Ritz variational principle we\nderive a differential equation for f(r12) and solve it using numerical\npropagation or analytic asymptotic expansion techniques. We found that for\nevery model under consideration, f(r12) behaves at large r12 as r12^{\\rho}\nexp(B r12) and obtained simple analytic expressions for the system dependent\nvalues of {\\rho} and B. For the ground state of the helium-like ions the value\nof B is positive, so that f(r12) diverges as r12 tends to infinity. The\nnumerical propagation confirms this result. When the Hartree-Fock orbitals,\nmultiplied by the correlation factor, are expanded in terms of Slater functions\nr^n exp(-{\\beta}r), the numerical propagation reveals a minimum in f(r12) with\ndepth increasing with N. For the lowest triplet state B is negative. Employing\nour analytical findings, we propose a new 'range-separated' form of the\ncorrelation factor with the short- and long-range r12 regimes approximated by\nappropriate asymptotic formulas connected by a switching function.

A key reason for\nthis is that quantizing at the noise level suffices to achieve the cut-set\nbound approximately to within an additive gap, without any requirement of\ninstantaneous channel state information (CSI). However, DMT only captures the\nhigh SNR performance and potentially, limited CSI at the relay can improve\nperformance at moderate SNRs.

Focusing on vector Gaussian\nquantizers, we optimize the outage probability for the full-duplex and\nhalf-duplex single relay by finding the best quantization level and relay\nschedule according to the available CSI at the relays. For the N-relay diamond\nnetwork, we derive an universal quantizer that sharpens the additive\napproximation gap of QMF from the conventional \\Theta(N) bits/s/Hz to\n\\Theta(log(N)) bits/s/Hz using only network topology information.

Predictions of drug\neffectiveness based on a comprehensive network model of cellular signalling are\ndifficult, due to our partial knowledge of the complex biological processes\ndownstream of the targeted kinases.

We clarify that the theoretically\npredicted type II migration is too fast, as well as type I migration, by\ndeveloping detailed analytical arguments in which the timescale of type II\nmigration is compared with the disk lifetime. In the disk-dominated regime, the\ntype II migration timescale is characterized by a {\\it local} viscous diffusion\ntimescale, while the disk lifetime characterized by a {\\it global} diffusion\ntimescale that is much longer than the local one. Even in the planet-dominated\nregime where the inertia of the planet mass reduces the migration speed, the\ntimescale is still shorter than the disk lifetime except in the final disk\nevolution stage where the total disk mass decays below the planet mass. This\nsuggests that most giant planets plunge into the central stars within the disk\nlifetime, and it contradicts the exoplanet observations that gas giants are\npiled up at $r \\ga 1$AU. We examine additional processes that may arise in\nprotoplanetary disks: dead zones, photoevaporation of gas, and gas flow across\na gap formed by a type II migrator. Although they make the type II migration\ntimescale closer to the disk lifetime, we show that none of them can act as an\neffective barrier for rapid type II migration with the current knowledge of\nthese processes. We point out that gas flow across a gap and the fraction of\nthe flow accreted onto the planets are uncertain and they may have a potential\nto solve the problem. Much more detailed investigation for each process may be\nneeded to explain the observed distribution of gas giants in extrasolar\nplanetary systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Jul 2013 01:31:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

The outage probability, on the other hand, is widely\nused to analyze the relationship among the communication efficiency,\nreliability, SNR, and channel fading. To the best of our knowledge, the\nprevious works only studied the asymptotic outage performance of the parallel\nfading channel which are only valid for a large number of subchannels or high\nSNRs. In this paper, a unified performance metric, which we shall refer to as\nthe outage exponent, will be proposed. Our approach is mainly based on the\nlarge deviations theory and the Meijer's G-function. It is shown that the\nproposed outage exponent is not only an accurate estimation of the outage\nprobability for any number of subchannels, any SNR, and any target transmission\nrate, but also provides an easy way to compute the outage capacity, finite-SNR\ndiversity-multiplexing tradeoff, and SNR gain. The asymptotic performance\nmetrics, such as the delay-limited capacity, ergodic capacity, and\ndiversity-multiplexing tradeoff can be directly obtained by letting the number\nof subchannels or SNR tends to infinity. Similar to Gallager's error exponent,\na reliable function for parallel fading channels, which illustrates a\nfundamental relationship between the transmission reliability and efficiency,\ncan also be defined from the outage exponent. Therefore, the proposed outage\nexponent provides a complete and comprehensive performance measure for parallel\nfading channels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Jul 2013 03:26:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-19"}

Of the various criteria\ncommonly used in this community, we are able to isolate three that are strongly\ncharacterizing: black-box componentization, which we had identified previously,\nbut also interface extensibility and customizability of run-time optimization\ngoals. These criteria are well matched by Intel's Concurrent Collections and\nAstraKahn, and also by OpenCL, POSIX and VMWare ESX.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Jul 2013 04:06:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-19"}

In order to successfully achieve\nthese goals, systematics in shear measurements have to be taken into account;\ntheir impact on the weak lensing power spectrum has to be carefully\ninvestigated in order to estimate the bias induced on the inferred cosmological\nparameters. To this end, we develop here an efficient tool to compute the power\nspectrum of systematics by propagating, in a realistic way, shear measurement,\nsource properties and survey setup uncertainties. Starting from analytical\nresults for unweighted moments and general assumptions on the relation between\nmeasured and actual shear, we derive analytical expressions for the\nmultiplicative and additive bias, showing how these terms depend not only on\nthe shape measurement errors, but also on the properties of the source galaxies\n(namely, size, magnitude and spectral energy distribution). We are then able to\ncompute the amplitude of the systematics power spectrum and its scaling with\nredshift, while we propose a multigaussian expansion to model in a\nnon-parametric way its angular scale dependence. Our method allows to\nself-consistently propagate the systematics uncertainties to the finally\nobserved shear power spectrum, thus allowing us to quantify the departures from\nthe actual spectrum. We show that even a modest level of systematics can induce\nnon-negligible deviations, thus leading to a significant bias on the recovered\ncosmological parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Jul 2013 08:00:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-05"}

Some of these models have partially succeeded, focussing however on\nmassive planets, and for the sake of simplicity excluding planets belonging to\nplanetary systems. However, more and more planets are now found in planetary\nsystems. This tendency, which is a result of both radial velocity, transit and\ndirect imaging surveys, seems to be even more pronounced for low mass planets.\nThese new observations require the improvement of planet formation models,\nincluding new physics, and considering the formation of systems. In a recent\nseries of papers, we have presented some improvements in the physics of our\nmodels, focussing in particular on the internal structure of forming planets,\nand on the computation of the excitation state of planetesimals, and their\nresulting accretion rate. In this paper, we focus on the concurrent effect of\nthe formation of more than one planet in the same protoplanetary disc, and show\nthe effect, in terms of global architecture and composition of this\nmultiplicity.

The HGPS aims at the detection of cosmic accelerators with\nenvironments suitable for the production of photons at the highest energies and\nhas led to the discovery of an unexpectedly large and diverse population of\nover 60 sources of TeV gamma rays within its current range of l = 250 to 65\ndegrees in longitude and |b|<3.5 degrees in latitude. The data set of the HGPS\ncomprises 2800 hours of high-quality data, taken in the years 2004 to 2013. The\nsensitivity for the detection of point-like sources, assuming a power-law\nspectrum with a spectral index of 2.3 at a statistical significance of 5 sigma,\nis now at the level of 2% Crab or better in the core HGPS region. The latest\nmaps of the inner Galaxy at TeV energies are shown alongside an introduction to\nthe first H.E.S.S. Galactic Plane Survey catalog. Finally, in addition to an\noverview of the H.E.S.S. Galactic source population a few remarkable, recently\ndiscovered sources will be highlighted.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Jul 2013 08:46:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 Jul 2013 08:38:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-14"}

Emission\nlines of sodium were the strongest in the spectrum as is common in comets, but\nalso potassium lines were detected. These have been rarely observed in comets\nsince the apparition of brightest comet C/1965 S1 (Ikeya-Seki). Lithium was not\ndetected, and stringent upper limits of its abundance compared to other alkali\nwere derived. We obtain abundance ratios Na/K = 54 +/-14 and Na/Li > 8000. As\nwell as in Mercury exosphere (Leblanc & Douressoundiram 2011)}, we show that\nphotoionization at the beginning of the alkali tails may increase the solar\nratio Na/K = 15.5 (Asplund et al 2009) by a factor 3, close to that required to\nmatch the observed value. In the same tail position the Na/Li ratio increases\nby a factor 2 only, very far from the factor > 8 required to match an original\nmeteoritic ratio. We apply the same model to similar alkali data (Preston 1967)\nof comet C/1965 S1 (Ikeya-Seki), obtaining consistent results. An original\nsolar Na/K ratio fits the observed value at the beginning of the alkali tails\nwithin the slit size, whereas Li is depleted by a factor > 8.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Jul 2013 10:00:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

Our objective is to characterize the\nHI content of the XMP galaxies as a class, using as a reference the list of 140\nknown local XMPs compiled by Morales-Luis et al. (2011). We have observed 29\nXMPs, which had not been observed before at 21 cm, using the Effelsberg radio\ntelescope. This information was complemented with HI data published in\nliterature for a further 53 XMPs. In addition, optical data from the literature\nprovided morphologies, stellar masses, star-formation rates and metallicities.\nEffelsberg HI integrated flux densities are between 1 and 15 Jy km/s, while\nline widths are between 20 and 120 km/s. HI integrated flux densities and line\nwidths from literature are in the range 0.1 - 200 Jy km/s and 15 - 150 km/s,\nrespectively. Of the 10 new Effelsberg detections, two sources show an\nasymmetric double-horn profile, while the remaining sources show either\nasymmetric (7 sources) or symmetric (1 source) single-peak 21 cm line profiles.\nAn asymmetry in the HI line profile is systematically accompanied by an\nasymmetry in the optical morphology. Typically, the g-band stellar\nmass-to-light ratios are ~0.1, whereas the HI gas mass-to-light ratios may be\nup to 2 orders of magnitude larger. Moreover, HI gas-to-stellar mass ratios\nfall typically between 10 and 20, denoting that XMPs are extremely gas-rich. We\nfind an anti-correlation between the HI gas mass-to-light ratio and the\nluminosity, whereby fainter XMPs are more gas-rich than brighter XMPs,\nsuggesting that brighter sources have converted a larger fraction of their HI\ngas into stars. The dynamical masses inferred from the HI line widths imply\nthat the stellar mass does not exceed 5% of the dynamical mass, while the\n\\ion{H}{i} mass constitutes between 20 and 60% of the dynamical mass.\n(abridged)\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Jul 2013 10:42:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

Predictions of 146Sm and 144Sm\nproduction in the gamma-process in massive stars are at odds with these\nconstraints and this is partly due to deficiences in the prediction of the\nreaction rates involved. The production ratio depends almost exclusively on the\n(gamma,n)/(gamma,alpha) branching at 148Gd. A measurement of\n144Sm(alpha,gamma)148Gd at low energy had discovered considerable discrepancies\nbetween cross section predictions and the data. Although this reaction cross\nsection mainly depends on the optical alpha+nucleus potential, no global\noptical potential has yet been found which can consistently describe the\nresults of this and similar alpha-induced reactions at the low energies\nencountered in astrophysical environments. The untypically large deviation in\n144Sm(alpha,gamma) and the unusual energy dependence can be explained, however,\nby low-energy Coulomb excitation which is competing with compound nucleus\nformation at very low energies. Considering this additional reaction channel,\nthe cross sections can be described with the usual optical potential\nvariations, compatible with findings for (n,alpha) reactions in this mass\nrange. Low-energy (alpha,gamma) and (alpha,n) data on other nuclei can also be\nconsistently explained in this way. Since Coulomb excitation does not affect\nalpha-emission, the 148Gd(gamma,alpha) rate is much higher than previously\nassumed. This leads to small 146Sm/144Sm stellar production ratios, in even\nmore pronounced conflict with the meteorite data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Jul 2013 12:24:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-08"}

Using the empirical relations\nbetween emission flux of chromospheric lines and X-ray flux, this star is\nconsidered to show much higher coronal activity than that of the Sun. It\nprobably has large starspots which can store a large amount of magnetic energy\nenough to give rise to superflares.

This difference can be explained by its small inclination\nangle (nearly pole-on). The small inclination angle is also supported by the\ncontrast between the large superflare amplitude and the small stellar\nbrightness variation amplitude.

We want to characterize\nthe physical conditions in such sources, and test whether their properties\ndepend on the evolutionary stage of the clump.\n  Methods. With ATCA we observed the selected sources in the NH3(1,1) and (2,2)\ntransitions and in the 22 GHz H2O maser line. Ammonia lines are a good\ntemperature probe that allow us to accurately determine the mass and the\ncolumn-, volume-, and surface densities of the clumps. We also collected all\ndata available to construct the spectral energy distribution of the individual\nclumps and to determine if star formation is already occurring, through\nobservations of its most common signposts, thus putting constraints on the\nevolutionary stage of the source. We fitted the spectral energy distribution\nbetween 1.2 mm and 70 microns with a modified black body to derive the dust\ntemperature and independently determine the mass.\n  Results. The clumps are cold (T~10-30 K), massive (M~10^2-10^3 Mo), and dense\n(n(H2)>~10^5 cm^-3) and they have high column densities (N(H2)~10^23 cm^-2).\nAll clumps appear to be potentially able to form high-mass stars. The most\nmassive clumps appear to be gravitationally unstable, if the only sources of\nsupport against collapse are turbulence and thermal pressure, which possibly\nindicates that the magnetic field is important in stabilizing them.\n  Conclusions. After investigating how the average properties depend on the\nevolutionary phase of the source, we find that the temperature and central\ndensity progressively increase with time.

By means of Lyapunov techniques some sufficient\nconditions are obtained for the exponential stability of the switching system,\nuniformly for all switching signals. Different cases are considered with or\nwithout a dwell time assumption on the switching signals, and on the number of\npositive characteristic velocities (which may also depend on the switching\nsignal). Some numerical simulations are also given to illustrate some main\nresults, and to motivate this study.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Jul 2013 15:16:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-01"}

In theory, auction mechanisms have many desirable\neconomic properties. However, keyword auctions have a number of limitations\nincluding: the uncertainty in payment prices for advertisers; the volatility in\nthe search engine's revenue; and the weak loyalty between advertiser and search\nengine. In this paper we propose a special ad option that alleviates these\nproblems. In our proposal, an advertiser can purchase an option from a search\nengine in advance by paying an upfront fee, known as the option price. He then\nhas the right, but no obligation, to purchase among the pre-specified set of\nkeywords at the fixed cost-per-clicks (CPCs) for a specified number of clicks\nin a specified period of time.

This novel\nstructure has many benefits: advertisers can have reduced uncertainty in\nadvertising; the search engine can improve the advertisers' loyalty as well as\nobtain a stable and increased expected revenue over time. Since the proposed ad\noption can be implemented in conjunction with the existing keyword auctions,\nthe option price and corresponding fixed CPCs must be set such that there is no\narbitrage between the two markets.

Because a\nlarger gap implies a smaller cost, we study the limits of spectral gap\namplification in this context. We show that, under some assumptions on the\nground states and the cost of evolving with the Hamiltonians (which apply to\nthe standard constructions), an upper bound on the gap of order 1/L follows. In\naddition, if the Hamiltonians satisfy a frustration-free property, the upper\nbound is of order 1/L^2. Our proofs use recent results on adiabatic state\ntransformations, spectral gap amplification, and the simulation of\ncontinuous-time quantum query algorithms. They also consider a reduction from\nthe unstructured search problem, whose lower bound in the oracle cost\ntranslates into the upper bounds in the gaps.

There, they set the stage for a new class of\nuniversal physics: Two-body interactions are all but invisible, but three-body\neffects allow the emergence of a largely uncharted new world of many-particle\nbound states. Three-particle systems were characterized theoretically, and the\nground-state properties of small unitary clusters computed numerically, but the\nmacroscopic many-body behaviour has remained unknown. Here we show, using a\nPath-Integral Monte Carlo algorithm backed up by theoretical arguments, that\nthe unitary Bose gas presents a first-order phase transition from a normal gas\nto a superfluid Efimov liquid. The normal gas is very well described by the\navailable virial coefficients. At unitarity, the phase diagram of the bosonic\nsystem is universal in rescaled pressure and temperature. A triple point\nseparates the normal gas, the superfluid Efimov liquid, and a third phase, the\nconventional superfluid gas. These two superfluid phases are separated by a\ncritical line that ends in a critical point at high temperature. This rich\nphase diagram should allow for a number of experimental protocols that would\nprobe these universal transitions between the normal gas, the superfluid gas,\nand the superfluid Efimov liquid.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Jul 2013 15:59:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 Aug 2013 10:06:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-06"}
