A new class has emerged called 'gamma-ray binaries', since most of their\nradiated power is emitted beyond 1 MeV. Accreting X-ray binaries, novae and a\ncolliding wind binary (eta Car) have also been detected - 'related systems'\nthat confirm the ubiquity of particle acceleration in astrophysical sources. Do\nthese systems have anything in common ? What drives their high-energy emission\n? How do the processes involved compare to those in other sources of gamma\nrays: pulsars, active galactic nuclei, supernova remnants ? I review the wealth\nof observational and theoretical work that have followed these detections, with\nan emphasis on gamma-ray binaries. I present the current evidence that\ngamma-ray binaries are driven by rotation-powered pulsars. Binaries are\nlaboratories giving access to different vantage points or physical conditions\non a regular timescale as the components revolve on their orbit. I explain the\nbasic ingredients that models of gamma-ray binaries use, the challenges that\nthey currently face, and how they can bring insights into the physics of\npulsars. I discuss how gamma-ray emission from microquasars provides a window\ninto the connection between accretion--ejection and acceleration, while eta Car\nand novae raise new questions on the physics of these objects - or on the\ntheory of diffusive shock acceleration. Indeed, explaining the gamma-ray\nemission from binaries strains our theories of high-energy astrophysical\nprocesses, by testing them on scales and in environments that were generally\nnot foreseen, and this is how these detections are most valuable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Jul 2013 16:09:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 Sep 2013 12:43:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-06"}

IP4 can act as a soluble analog of the phosphoinositide\n3-kinase (PI3K) membrane lipid product phosphatidylinositol(3,4,5)trisphosphate\n(PIP3). PIP3 recruits signaling proteins such as Itk to cellular membranes by\nbinding to PH and other domains. In thymocytes, low-dose IP4 binding to the Itk\nPH domain surprisingly promoted and high-dose IP4 inhibited PIP3 binding of Itk\nPH domains. However, the mechanisms that underlie the regulation of membrane\nrecruitment of Itk by IP4 and PIP3 remain unclear. The distinct Itk PH domain\nability to oligomerize is consistent with a cooperative-allosteric mode of IP4\naction. However, other possibilities cannot be ruled out due to difficulties in\nquantitatively measuring the interactions between Itk, IP4 and PIP3, and in\ngenerating non-oligomerizing Itk PH domain mutants. This has hindered a full\nmechanistic understanding of how IP4 controls Itk function.

We extend further\nthe formalism of the gSR in the self-similar model for X-ray galaxy clusters,\nshowing that for a generic relation M_tot ~ L^a M_g^b T^c, where L, M_g and T\nare the gas luminosity, mass and temperature, respectively, the values of the\nslopes lay in the plane 4*a+3*b+2*c=3. Using published dataset, we show that\nsome projections of the gSR are the most efficient relations, holding among\nobserved physical X-ray quantities, to recover the cluster mass. This\nconclusion is based on the evidence that they provide the lowest chi^2, the\nlowest total scatter and the lowest intrinsic scatter among the studied scaling\nlaws on both galaxy group and cluster mass scales. By the application of the\ngSR, the intrinsic scatter is reduced in all the cases down to a relative error\non M_tot below 16 per cent. The best-fit relations are: M_tot ~ M_g^a\nT^{1.5-1.5a}, with a~0.4, and M_tot ~ L^a T^{1.5-2a}, with a~0.15.

Here\nwe report on a systematic search for extrasolar trojan companions to 2244 known\nKepler Objects of Interest (KOIs), with epicyclic orbital characteristics\nsimilar to those of the Jovian trojan families. No convincing trojan candidates\nare found, despite a typical sensitivity down to Earth-size objects. This fact\ncan however not be used to stringently exclude the existence of trojans in this\nsize range, since stable trojans need not necessarily share the same orbital\nplane as the planet, and thus may not transit. Following this reasoning, we\nnote that if Earth-sized trojans exist at all, they are almost certainly both\npresent and in principle detectable in the full set of Kepler data, although a\nvery substantial computational effort would be required to detect them.

To efficiently utilize the large bandwidth available\nto a connection in an HSN, sliding window protocols require a large\ntransmission window.

This can be understood in a\npicture where the electron states are propagating waves, without need to\naccount for electron-electron interactions. Quantised conductance could thus be\nthe signature of ultimate control over nanoscale electron transport. However,\neven studies with the cleanest QPCs generically show significant anomalies on\nthe quantised conductance traces and there is consensus that these result from\nelectron many-body effects.

Here, we discuss\nresearch involving the FCI to evaluate the pedagogical content knowledge of\nboth instructors and teaching assistants (TAs) of varying teaching experience.\nFor each item on the FCI, the instructors and TAs were asked to identify the\nmost common incorrect answer choice of introductory physics students. We also\ndiscussed the responses individually with a few instructors. Then, we used the\nFCI pre-test and post-test data from a large population (~900) of introductory\nphysics students to assess the pedagogical content knowledge of physics\ninstructors and TAs. We find that while both physics instructors and TAs, on\naverage, performed better than random guessing at identifying introductory\nstudents' difficulties with FCI content, they did not identify many common\ndifficulties that introductory physics students have, even after traditional\ninstruction. Moreover, the ability to correctly identify students' difficulties\nwas not correlated with the teaching experience of the physics instructors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Jul 2013 21:42:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-24"}

The spatial distribution of the haloes\nfollows that of the dark matter environment. We find that VGS_31-like systems\nhave a large variation in formation time, having formed between 10 Gyr ago and\nthe present epoch.

Some\nservices permits also one-way trips, which allows the user to return the\nvehicle in another station. The one-way scheme is quite more attractive for the\nusers, but may pose a problem for the distribution of the vehicles, due to a\npossible unbalancing between the user demand and the availability of vehicles\nor free slots at the stations. Such a problem is more complicated in the case\nof electrical car sharing, where the travel range depends on the level of\ncharge of the vehicles. The paper presents a new approach for the Electric\nVehicle Relocation Problem, where cars are moved by personnel of the service\noperator to keep the system balanced. Such a problem generates a challenging\npickup and delivery problem with new features that to the best of our knowledge\nnever have been considered in the literature.

In this\npaper, we generalize this discussion to models with a \"Mixed Gluino\", that\nacquires both Dirac and Majorana masses, as well as models in which electroweak\ngauginos contribute to squark production. Our primary interest is the degree of\nsuppression of the cross section for first generation squarks compared with a\ngluino with a pure Majorana mass. We find that not all Majorana masses are\nalike -- a Majorana mass for the gluino can suppress the squark production\ncross section, whereas a Majorana mass for the adjoint fermion partner leads to\nan increased cross section, compared with a pure Dirac gluino. In the presence\nof electroweak gauginos, squark production can increase by at most a factor of\na few above the pure Dirac gluino case when the electroweak gauginos have\npurely Majorana masses near to the squark masses. This unusual set of gaugino\nmasses is interesting since the usual Higgs quartic coupling would not be\nsuppressed. When the electroweak gaugino masses are much lighter than the\nsquarks, there is a negligible change to the squark production cross section.\nWe explain both of these cases in detail by considering the various\nsubprocesses for squark production at the LHC. Continued searches for squark\nproduction with cross sections much smaller than expected in the MSSM are\nabsolutely warranted, and we suggest new simplified models to fully\ncharacterize the collider constraints.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Jul 2013 00:34:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-26"}

To this end scientists are undertaking large-scale genetic\nassociation studies that aim to identify genetic variants associated with\nmolecular and cellular phenotypes, such as gene expression, transcription\nfactor binding, or chromatin accessibility. These studies use high-throughput\nsequencing assays (e.g. RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, DNase-seq) to obtain high-resolution\ndata on how the traits vary along the genome in each sample. However, typical\nassociation analyses fail to exploit these high-resolution measurements,\ninstead aggregating the data at coarser resolutions, such as genes, or windows\nof fixed length.

One of the few drawbacks\nof the original polar code construction is that it is not universal. This means\nthat the code has to be tailored to the channel if we want to transmit close to\ncapacity.\n  We present two \"polar-like\" schemes which are capable of achieving the\ncompound capacity of the whole class of binary-input memoryless\noutput-symmetric channels with low complexity.\n  Roughly speaking, for the first scheme we stack up $N$ polar blocks of length\n$N$ on top of each other but shift them with respect to each other so that they\nform a \"staircase.\" Coding then across the columns of this staircase with a\nstandard Reed-Solomon code, we can achieve the compound capacity using a\nstandard successive decoder to process the rows (the polar codes) and in\naddition a standard Reed-Solomon erasure decoder to process the columns.\nCompared to standard polar codes this scheme has essentially the same\ncomplexity per bit but a block length which is larger by a factor $O(N\n\\log_2(N)/\\epsilon)$, where $\\epsilon$ is the gap to capacity.\n  For the second scheme we first show how to construct a true polar code which\nachieves the compound capacity for a finite number of channels. We achieve this\nby introducing special \"polarization\" steps which \"align\" the good indices for\nthe various channels. We then show how to exploit the compactness of the space\nof binary-input memoryless output-symmetric channels to reduce the compound\ncapacity problem for this class to a compound capacity problem for a finite set\nof channels.

One has to combine surface brightness information at\ndifferent spatial resolutions, and specific methods are needed to derive N at a\nresolution higher than the lowest resolution of the observations. Some methods\nhave been discussed in the literature, including a method (in the following,\nmethod B) that constructs the N estimate in stages, where the smallest spatial\nscales being derived only use the shortest wavelength maps. We propose simple\nmodel fitting as a flexible way to estimate high-resolution column density\nmaps. Our goal is to evaluate the accuracy of this procedure and to determine\nwhether it is a viable alternative for making these maps. The new method\nconsists of model maps of column density (or intensity at a reference\nwavelength) and colour temperature. The model is fitted using Markov chain\nMonte Carlo (MCMC) methods, comparing model predictions with observations at\ntheir native resolution. We analyse simulated surface brightness maps and\ncompare its accuracy with method B and the results that would be obtained using\nhigh-resolution observations without noise. The new method is able to produce\nreliable column density estimates at a resolution significantly higher than the\nlowest resolution of the input maps. Compared to method B, it is relatively\nresilient against the effects of noise. The method is computationally more\ndemanding, but is feasible even in the analysis of large Herschel maps. The\nproposed empirical modelling method E is demonstrated to be a good alternative\nfor calculating high-resolution column density maps, even with considerable\nsuper-resolution. Both methods E and B include the potential for further\nimprovements, e.g., in the form of better a priori constraints.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Jul 2013 15:28:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

This theory is based on the relationship\nbetween the photon momentum and its energy that may take place only in vacuum,\nbut not in a medium with non-unity refractive index n. Here, we use Abraham's\nrepresentation for the momentum of a photon in medium for the creation of a new\nconsistent Compton effect theory accounting for media features. A new condition\nunder which anomalous Compton effect is possible, is defined. In our case, due\nto the photon scattering on a moving electron, the photon's energy can increase\nwhen the electron velocity is above a threshold value, in analogy with the\nVavilov-Cherenkov radiation effect.

Our goal is to determine the most effective strategies for\nreducing the overall population of Vicodin abusers. More specifically, we focus\non whether prevention methods aimed at educating doctors and patients on the\npotential for drug abuse or treatment methods implemented after a person abuses\nVicodin will have a greater overall impact. We consider one linear and two\nnon-linear compartmental models in which medical users of Vicodin can\ntransition into the abuser compartment or leave the population by no longer\ntaking the drug. Once Vicodin abusers, people can transition into a treatment\ncompartment, with the possibility of leaving the population through successful\ncompletion of treatment or of relapsing and re-entering the abusive\ncompartment. The linear model assumes no social interaction, while both\nnon-linear models consider interaction. One considers interaction with abusers\naffecting the relapse rate, while the other assumes both this and an additional\ninteraction between the number of abusers and the number of new prescriptions.\nSensitivity analyses are conducted varying the rates of success of these\nintervention methods measured by the parameters to determine which strategy has\nthe greatest impact on controlling the population of Vicodin abusers. From\nthese models and analyses, we determine that manipulating parameters tied to\nprevention measures has a greater impact on reducing the population of abusers\nthan manipulating parameters associated with treatment. We also note that\nincreasing the rate at which abusers seek treatment affects the population of\nabusers more than the success rate of treatment itself.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Jul 2013 19:26:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-19"}
