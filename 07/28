We make a systematic analysis of the most used common line profile\ndiagnosis, Bisector Inverse Slope and Velocity Span, along with the two\nproposed ones.

We demonstrate that the bi-Gaussian method allows a more precise\ncharacterization of the deformation of line profiles than the standard bisector\ninverse slope. The calculation of the deformation indicator is simpler and its\ninterpretation more straightforward. More importantly, its amplitude can be up\nto 30% larger than that of the bisector span, allowing the detection of\nsmaller-amplitude correlations with radial-velocity variations. However, a\nparticular parametrization of the bisector inverse slope is shown to be more\nefficient on high-signal-to-noise data than both the standard bisector and the\nbi-Gaussian. The results of the Vasy method show that this indicator is more\neffective than any of the previous ones, being correlated with the\nradial-velocity with more significance for signals resulting from a line\ndeformation.

The most recent indications of such benefits are a lower tail (or\nfin) beat at the back of a school and reduced oxygen consumption in schooling\nfish versus solitary ones. How such advantages may arise is poorly understood.\nCurrent hydrodynamic theories concern either fish swimming side by side or in a\ndiamond configuration and they largely ignore effects of viscosity and\ninteractions among wakes and individuals. In reality, however, hydrodynamic\neffects are complex and fish swim in many configurations. Since these\nhydrodynamic effects are difficult to study empirically, we investigate them in\na computer model by incorporating viscosity and interactions among wakes and\nwith individuals. We compare swimming efficiency of mullets of 12.6 cm\ntravelling solitarily and in schools of four different configurations at\nseveral inter-individual distances. The resulting Reynolds number (based on\nfish length) is approximately 1150. We show that these fish always swim more\nefficiently in a school than alone (except in a dense phalanx). We indicate how\nthis efficiency may emerge from several kinds of interactions among wakes and\nindividuals.

The resolution of those gradients imposes the use of extremely\nsmall cells in the respective regions. Taking turbulence into account\nintensives the variation in scales even more. Furthermore, hypersonic flows\nhave been shown to be extremely grid sensitive. For the simulation of\nthree-dimensional configurations of engineering applications, this results in a\nhuge amount of cells and prohibitive computational time. Therefore, modern\nadaptive techniques can provide a gain with respect to computational costs and\naccuracy, allowing the generation of locally highly resolved flow regions where\nthey are needed and retaining an otherwise smooth distribution. An h-adaptive\ntechnique based on wavelets is employed for the solution of hypersonic flows.\nThe compressible Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes equations are solved using a\ndifferential Reynolds stress turbulence model, well suited to predict\nshock-wave-boundary-layer interactions in high enthalpy flows. Two test cases\nare considered: a compression corner and a scramjet intake.

Subsequently a\nthree-dimensional geometry is considered. Both test cases are validated with\nexperimental data and compared to non-adaptive computations.

Questions posted on Stack\nOverflow which are not related to programming topics, are marked as 'closed' by\nexperienced users and community moderators. A question can be 'closed' for five\nreasons - duplicate, off-topic, subjective, not a real question and too\nlocalized. In this work, we present the first study of 'closed' questions in\nStack Overflow. We download 4 years of publicly available data which contains\n3.4 Million questions. We first analyze and characterize the complete set of\n0.1 Million 'closed' questions. Next, we use a machine learning framework and\nbuild a predictive model to identify a 'closed' question at the time of\nquestion creation.\n  One of our key findings is that despite being marked as 'closed', subjective\nquestions contain high information value and are very popular with the users.\nWe observe an increasing trend in the percentage of closed questions over time\nand find that this increase is positively correlated to the number of newly\nregistered users. In addition, we also see a decrease in community\nparticipation to mark a 'closed' question which has led to an increase in\nmoderation job time. We also find that questions closed with the Duplicate and\nOff Topic labels are relatively more prone to reputation gaming. For the\n'closed' question prediction task, we make use of multiple genres of feature\nsets based on - user profile, community process, textual style and question\ncontent. We use a state-of-art machine learning classifier based on an ensemble\nlearning technique and achieve an overall accuracy of 73%. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first experimental study to analyze and predict 'closed'\nquestions on Stack Overflow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Jul 2013 18:21:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-30"}

The United States\nDepartment of Agriculture - Agricultural Research Service reciprocal recurrent\nselection experiment between the Iowa Stiff Stalk Synthetic (BSSS) and the Iowa\nCorn Borer Synthetic No. 1 (BSCB1) populations represents one of the longest\nstanding models of selection for hybrid performance. To investigate the genomic\nimpact of this selection program, we used the Illumina MaizeSNP50 high-density\nSNP array to determine genotypes of progenitor lines and over 600 individuals\nacross multiple cycles of selection. Consistent with previous research (Messmer\net al., 1991; Labate et al., 1997; Hagdorn et al., 2003; Hinze et al., 2005),\nwe found that genetic diversity within each population steadily decreases, with\na corresponding increase in population structure. High marker density also\nenabled the first view of haplotype ancestry, fixation and recombination within\nthis historic maize experiment. Extensive regions of haplotype fixation within\neach population are visible in the pericentromeric regions, where large blocks\ntrace back to single founder inbreds. Simulation attributes most of the\nobserved reduction in genetic diversity to genetic drift. Signatures of\nselection were difficult to observe in the background of this strong genetic\ndrift, but heterozygosity in each population has fallen more than expected.\nRegions of haplotype fixation represent the most likely targets of selection,\nbut as observed in other germplasm selected for hybrid performance (Feng et\nal., 2006), there is no overlap between the most likely targets of selection in\nthe two populations. We discuss how this pattern is likely to occur during\nselection for hybrid performance, and how it poses challenges for dissecting\nthe impacts of modern breeding and selection on the maize genome.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Jul 2013 21:41:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-29"}

These electrons are then propagated in the semiclassical\napproximation, and relying on a numerical solution of the inner region, which\nis accessible using quantum chemical techniques, we describe the subsequent\nevolution of the ionized electron and the ionic core.\n  Importantly, we show that correlation interactions between the ionized\nelectrons and those left behind in the core can play a role during ionization,\nand that interactions can occur while the electron is still inside the\nclassically forbidden region that enable tunnelling from channels normally\nsubject to far greater exponential suppression since they are subject to higher\nand wider tunnelling barriers.\n  This interaction can be described analytically using saddle-point methods\nthat find the dominant contributions to the temporal, spatial and momentum\nintegrals that make up the expressions for the ionization yield. However, these\nmethods yield results for the angular distributions of the ionized electron\nthat do not necessarily match experiment and which yield physically\nunsatisfactory solutions.\n  In this report we develop a formalism to evaluate these integrals exactly,\nwhich yields more precise calculations of the angular distributions while at\nthe same time providing the language, in terms of exchange of angular momentum,\nwith which to understand their origins and their differences from previous\ncases, thus giving an insight into the fundamental physics of the correlation\ninteraction process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Jul 2013 03:58:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Aug 2013 12:52:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-26"}

Aims: The\nsearch for transiting planets in these long time series is computationally\nintensive. We wish to optimize the search for both detection and computational\nefficiencies. Methods: We assume that the searched systems can be well\ndescribed by Keplerian orbits. We then propagate the effects of different\nsystem parameters to the detection parameters. Results: We show that the\nfrequency information content of the light curve is primarily determined by the\nduty cycle of the transit signal, and thus the optimal frequency sampling is\nfound to be cubic and not linear. Further optimization is achieved by\nconsidering duty-cycle dependent binning of the phased light curve. By using\nthe (standard) BLS one is either rather insensitive to long-period planets, or\nless sensitive to short-period planets and computationally slower by a\nsignificant factor of ~330 (for a 3yr long dataset). We also show how the\nphysical system parameters, such as the host star's size and mass, directly\naffect transit detection. This understanding can then be used to optimize the\nsearch for every star individually. Conclusions: By considering Keplerian\ndynamics explicitly rather than implicitly one can optimally search the BLS\nparameter space. The presented Optimal BLS enhances the detectability of both\nvery short and very long period planets while allowing such searches to be done\nwith much reduced resources and time. The Matlab/Octave source code for Optimal\nBLS is made available.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Jul 2013 03:59:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

We study\ntwo approaches for crowd aggregation on multicategory answer spaces stochastic\nmodeling based and deterministic objective function based. Our stochastic model\nfor answer generation plausibly captures the interplay between worker skills,\nintentions, and task difficulties and allows us to model a broad range of\nworker types.

We show that a Z-tensor is a\nnonsingular M-tensor if and only if it is semi-positive. Thus, a nonsingular\nM-tensor has all positive diagonal entries; and an M-tensor, regarding as the\nlimitation of a series of nonsingular M-tensors, has all nonnegative diagonal\nentries. We introduce even-order monotone tensors and present their spectral\nproperties. In matrix theory, a Z-matrix is a nonsingular M-matrix if and only\nif it is monotone.

LBNE\nis conceived around three central components: (1) a new, high-intensity\nneutrino source generated from a megawatt-class proton accelerator at Fermi\nNational Accelerator Laboratory, (2) a near neutrino detector just downstream\nof the source, and (3) a massive liquid argon time-projection chamber deployed\nas a far detector deep underground at the Sanford Underground Research\nFacility.

A continuous-mode multi-photon state is a state of a travelling light\nwavepacket that contains a definite number of photons and is characterised by a\ntemporal (or equivalently spectral) profile. After the interaction with the\nsystem, the outgoing light can be monitored by means of homodyne detection or\nphotodetection. Filters for both measurement schemes are derived in this paper.\nUnlike the vacuum or the coherent state case, the annihilation operator of the\nlight field acting on a multi-photon state changes the state by annihilating a\nphoton, and this makes the traditional filtering techniques inapplicable. To\ncircumvent this difficulty, we adopt a non-Markovian embedding technique\nproposed in \\cite{gough:2013} for the study of the single-photon filtering\nproblem. However, the multi-photon nature of the problem addressed in this\npaper makes the study much more mathematically involved. Moreover, as\ndemonstrated by an example --- a two-level system driven by a continuous-mode\ntwo-photon state, multi-photon filters can reveal interesting strong nonlinear\noptical phenomena absent in both the single-photon state case and the\ncontinuous-mode Fock state case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Jul 2013 14:30:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 29 Sep 2014 00:44:10 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 4 Dec 2015 08:13:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-07"}

For many years, this system has\nbeen the subject of study by numerous authors. However, until now the structure\nof the Lorenz attractor is not clear completely yet, and the most important\nquestion at present is to understand the bifurcation scenario of chaos\ntransition in this system. Using some numerical results and our bifurcational\ngeometric approach, we present a new scenario of chaos transition in the\nclassical Lorenz system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Jul 2013 07:59:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-01"}
