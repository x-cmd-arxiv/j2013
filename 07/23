The\norigin of the Dirac constraints in our framework is shown: if we define extra\nmomenta $p_{\\alpha}$ by (86), then we obtain the standard primary constraints\n(87), and the new brackets transform to the Dirac bracket. Quantization is\ndiscussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Jul 2013 16:41:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-23"}

Here we present new spectra of 1996 FG3 and\nwe compare our new data with other published spectra, analysing the variation\nin the spectral slope. The asteroid will not be observable again over the next\nthree years at least. We obtained the spectra using DOLORES and NICS\ninstruments at the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo (TNG), a 3.6m telescope located\nat El Roque de los Muchachos Observatory in La Palma, Spain. To compare with\nother published spectra of the asteroid, we computed the spectral slope S', and\nstudied any plausible correlation of this quantity with the phase angle\n(alpha). In the case of visible spectra, we find a variation in spectral slope\nof Delta S' = 0.15 +- 0.10 %/10^3 A/degree for 3 < alpha < 18 degrees, in good\nagreement with the values found in the literature for the phase reddening\neffect.

The variation in the\nspectral slope of asteroid 1996 FG3 shows a trend with the phase angle at the\ntime of the observations, both in the visible and the near-infrared.

Examples are image segmentation, multiview\nstereo reconstruction, geometric interpolation from data point clouds. To\nobtain the solution of such a problem, one usually resorts to an iterative\napproach, a gradient descent algorithm, which updates a candidate shape\ngradually deforming it into the optimal shape. Computing the gradient descent\nupdates requires the knowledge of the first variation of the shape energy, or\nrather the first shape derivative. In addition to the first shape derivative,\none can also utilize the second shape derivative and develop a Newton-type\nmethod with faster convergence. Unfortunately, the knowledge of shape\nderivatives for shape energies in image processing is patchy. The second shape\nderivatives are known for only two of the energies in the image processing\nliterature and many results for the first shape derivative are limiting, in the\nsense that they are either for curves on planes, or developed for a specific\nrepresentation of the shape or for a very specific functional form in the shape\nenergy. In this work, these limitations are overcome and the first and second\nshape derivatives are computed for large classes of shape energies that are\nrepresentative of the energies found in image processing. Many of the formulas\nwe obtain are new and some generalize previous existing results. These results\nare valid for general surfaces in any number of dimensions. This work is\nintended to serve as a cookbook for researchers who deal with shape energies\nfor various applications in image processing and need to develop algorithms to\ncompute the shapes minimizing these energies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Jul 2013 17:46:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-23"}

The idea is\nbased on the observation that GR statistics characterize seismicity for all\nspace and time. Small magnitude event counts (quake counts) are used as markers\nfor the approach of large events. More specifically, if the GR b-value = 1,\nthen for every 1000 M>3 earthquakes, one expects 1 M>6 earthquake. So if ~1000\nM>3 events have occurred in a spatial region since the last M>6 earthquake,\nanother M>6 earthquake should be expected soon.

Obtaining high\nresolution 3D reconstructions is difficult due to unknown orientations and\npositions of the imaged particles, possible incomplete coverage of the viewing\ndirections, high level of noise in the projection images, and limiting effects\nof the contrast transfer function of the electron microscope. In this paper, we\nfocus on the 3D reconstruction problem from projection images assuming an\nexisting estimate for their orientations and positions. We propose a fast and\naccurate Fourier-based Iterative Reconstruction Method (FIRM) that exploits the\nToeplitz structure of the operator ${\\bf A}^{*}{\\bf A}$, where $\\bf A$ is the\nforward projector and ${\\bf A}^{*}$ is the back projector. The operator ${\\bf\nA}^{*}{\\bf A}$ is equivalent to a convolution with a kernel. The kernel is\npre-computed using the non-uniform Fast Fourier Transform and is efficiently\napplied in each iteration step. The iterations by FIRM are therefore\nconsiderably faster than those of traditional iterative algebraic approaches,\nwhile maintaining the same accuracy even when the viewing directions are\nunevenly distributed. The time complexity of FIRM is comparable to the direct\nFourier inversion method. Moreover, FIRM combines images from different defocus\ngroups simultaneously and can handle a wide range of regularization terms. We\nprovide experimental results on simulated data that demonstrate the speed and\naccuracy of FIRM in comparison with current methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Jul 2013 19:14:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-23"}

This line emission makes z~5-7 galaxies appear more massive, with\nlower specific star formation rates. However, corrections for this line\nemission have been very difficult to perform reliably due to huge uncertainties\non the overall strength of such emission at z>~5.5. Here, we present the most\ndirect observational evidence yet for ubiquitous high-EW [OIII]+Hbeta line\nemission in Lyman-break galaxies at z~7, while also presenting a strategy for\nan improved measurement of the sSFR at z~7. We accomplish this through the\nselection of bright galaxies in the narrow redshift window z~6.6-7.0 where the\nIRAC 4.5 micron flux provides a clean measurement of the stellar continuum\nlight. Observed 4.5 micron fluxes in this window contrast with the 3.6 micron\nfluxes which are contaminated by the prominent [OIII]+Hbeta lines. To ensure a\nhigh S/N for our IRAC flux measurements, we consider only the brightest\n(H_{160}<26 mag) magnified galaxies we have identified in CLASH and other\nprograms targeting galaxy clusters. Remarkably, the mean rest-frame optical\ncolor for our bright seven-source sample is very blue, [3.6]-[4.5]=-0.9+/-0.3.\nSuch blue colors cannot be explained by the stellar continuum light and require\nthat the rest-frame EW of [OIII]+Hbeta be greater than 637 Angstroms for the\naverage source.

Our derived lower limit for the mean\n[OIII]+Hbeta EW could underestimate the true EW by ~2x based on a simple\nmodeling of the redshift distribution of our sources.

For more than a decade it has been debated whether this is the\ndominant process that leads to the formation of transitional disks. In this\npaper, we present millimeter-wave interferometric observations of the\ntransitional disk around the young intermediate mass star LkHa330. These\nobservations reveal a lopsided ring in the 1.3 mm dust thermal emission\ncharacterized by a radius of about 100 AU and an azimuthal intensity variation\nof a factor of 2. By comparing the observations with a Gaussian parametric\nmodel, we find that the observed asymmetry is consistent with a circular arc,\nthat extends azimuthally by about 90 deg and emits about 1/3 of the total\ncontinuum flux at 1.3 mm. Hydrodynamic simulations show that this structure is\nsimilar to the azimuthal asymmetries in the disk surface density that might be\nproduced by the dynamical interaction with unseen low mass companions orbiting\nwithin 70 AU from the central star. We argue that such asymmetries might lead\nto azimuthal variations in the millimeter-wave dust opacity and in the dust\ntemperature, which will also affect the millimeter-wave continuum emission.\nAlternative explanations for the observed asymmetry that do not require the\npresence of companions cannot be ruled out with the existing data. Further\nobservations of both the dust and molecular gas emission are required to derive\nfirm conclusions on the origin of the asymmetry observed in the LkHa330 disk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Jul 2013 20:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

We\nfind that L_[OIII] ~ L_8micron^(1.4), consistent with a picture in which the\nL_[OIII] is dependent on the volume of the NLR.

The main claim is that a single mode of the lathe radiation is\nmaximally entangled with the mode inside the horizon and simultaneously with\nthe modes of early Hawking radiation. We argue that this situation never\nhappens during the evolution of a black hole. Quantum mechanics tells us that\nwhile the black hole exists, unitary evolution maximally entangles a late mode\nlocated just outside the horizon with a combination of early radiation and\nblack hole states, instead of either of them separately. One of the reasons for\nthis is that the black hole radiation is not random and strongly depends on the\ngeometry and charge of the black hole, as detailed numerical calculations of\nHawking evaporation clearly show. As a consequence, one can't factor out the\nstate of the black hole. However, this extended entanglement between the black\nhole and modes of early and late radiation indicates that, as the black hole\nages, the local Rindler horizon is modified out to macroscopic distances from\nthe black hole. Fundamentally non-local physics nor firewalls are not necessary\nto explain this result. We propose an infrared mechanism called {\\it icezone}\nthat is mediated by low energy interacting modes and acts near any event\nhorizon to entangle states separated by long distances. These interactions at\nfirst provide small corrections to the thermal Hawking radiation.

By now more than 300 planets transiting their host star have been\nfound, and much effort is being put into measuring the properties of each\nsystem. Light curves of planetary transits often contain deviations from a\nsimple transit shape, and it is generally difficult to differentiate between\nanomalies of astrophysical nature (e.g. starspots) and correlated noise due to\ninstrumental or atmospheric effects. Our solution is to observe transit events\nsimultaneously with two telescopes located at different observatories. Aims.\nUsing this observational strategy, we look for anomalies in the light curves of\ntwo transiting planetary systems and accurately estimate their physical\nparameters. Methods. We present the first photometric follow-up of the\ntransiting planet HAT-P-16 b, and new photometric observations of WASP-21 b,\nobtained simultaneously with two medium-class telescopes located in different\ncountries, using the telescope defocussing technique. We modeled these and\nother published data in order to estimate the physical parameters of the two\nplanetary systems. Results. The simultaneous observations did not highlight\nparticular features in the light curves, which is consistent with the low\nactivity levels of the two stars. For HAT-P-16, we calculated a new ephemeris\nand found that the planet is 1.3 \\sigma colder and smaller (Rb = 1.190 \\pm\n0.037 RJup) than the initial estimates, suggesting the presence of a massive\ncore. Our physical parameters for this system point towards a younger age than\npreviously thought. The results obtained for WASP-21 reveal lower values for\nthe mass and the density of the planet (by 1.0 \\sigma and 1.4 \\sigma\nrespectively) with respect to those found in the discovery paper, in agreement\nwith a subsequent study.

Over the years, many algorithms have been proposed to\nsolve this task. These algorithms assume that the data structure of the mining\ntask is small enough to fit in the main memory of a computer. However, as the\nreal-world graph data grows, both in size and quantity, such an assumption does\nnot hold any longer. To overcome this, some graph database-centric methods have\nbeen proposed in recent years for solving FSM; however, a distributed solution\nusing MapReduce paradigm has not been explored extensively. Since, MapReduce is\nbecoming the de- facto paradigm for computation on massive data, an efficient\nFSM algorithm on this paradigm is of huge demand.

Recursively partitioning a tree into contiguous subtrees\nand prescribing an ordering amongst the subtrees, Hierarchical Layouts\ngeneralize many commonly used layouts for trees such as in-order, pre-order and\nbreadth-first.

The coupling of stellar wind with its\nmagnetic field, i.e., magnetic braking, is the most promising mechanism to\ndrive AML in these stars. There are basically two properties driving magnetic\nbraking: the stellar magnetic field and the stellar wind. Understanding the\nmechanisms that drive AML therefore requires a comprehensive understanding of\nthese two properties. RRCae is a well-known nearby (d=20pc) eclipsing DA+M\nbinary with an orbital period of P=7.29h. The system harbors a metal-rich cool\nwhite dwarf (WD) and a highly active M-dwarf locked in synchronous rotation.\nThe metallicity of the WD suggests that wind accretion is taking place, which\nprovides a good opportunity to obtain the mass-loss rate of the M-dwarf\ncomponent. We analyzed multi-epoch time-resolved high-resolution spectra of\nRRCae in search for traces of magnetic activity and accretion. We selected a\nnumber of well-known activity indicators and studied their short and long-term\nbehavior. Indirect-imaging tomographic techniques were also applied to provide\nthe surface brightness distribution of the magnetically active M-dwarf, and\nreveals a polar feature similar to those observed in fast-rotating solar-type\nstars. The blue part of the spectrum was modeled using a atmosphere model to\nconstrain the WD properties and its metal enrichment. The latter was used to\nimprove the determination of the mass-accretion rate from the M-dwarf wind. The\npresence of metals in the WD spectrum suggests that this component arises from\naccretion of the M-dwarf wind. A model fit to the WD gives Teff=(7260+/-250)K\nand logg=(7.8+/-0.1) dex with a metallicity of <log[X/Xsun]>=(-2.8+/-0.1)dex,\nand a mass-accretion rate of dotMacc=(7+/-2)x1e-16Msun/yr.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Jul 2013 01:42:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-24"}

The covalent bonding of atoms in organic\npigments provides excited levels compatible with the energies of these photons.\nInternal conversion through vibrational relaxation to the ground state of these\nexcited molecules when in water leads to rapid dissipation of the solar photons\ninto heat, and this is the major source of entropy production on Earth. A\nnon-linear irreversible thermodynamic analysis shows that the proliferation of\norganic pigments on Earth is a direct consequence of the pigments catalytic\nproperties in dissipating the solar photon flux. A small part of the energy of\nthe photon goes into the production of more organic pigments and supporting\nbiomass, while most of the energy is dissipated and channeled into the\nhydrological cycle through the latent heat of vaporization of surface water. By\ndissipating the surface to atmosphere temperature gradient, the hydrological\ncycle further increases the entropy production of Earth.

Especially, for calculating $\\Gamma(B_c\\to\n\\psi(2S)X)$ the modified harmonic oscillator wave function (HOWF) which we\ndeveloped in early works is employed and the results indicate that the modified\nharmonic oscillator wave function works better than the traditional HOWF.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Jul 2013 02:18:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 Jul 2013 00:23:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-29"}

Brownian ratchets are\nfundamental in various biochemical processes, and are roughly divided into two\ncategories: active (usually ATP-powered) molecular motors and passive\nconstructions with a directional bias, where the transport is driven by thermal\nmotion. In this paper we discuss the latter process, of spontaneous\ntranslocation of molecules (Brownian particles) by ratcheted diffusion with no\nexternal energy input: a problem relevant for protein translocation along\nbacterial flagella or injectosome complex, or DNA translocation by\nbacteriophages. We use molecular dynamics simulations and statistical theory to\nidentify two regimes of transport: at low rate of particles injection into the\nchannel the process is controlled by the individual diffusion towards the open\nend (the first passage problem), while at a higher rate of injection the\ncrowded regime sets in. In this regime the particle density in the channel\nreaches a constant saturation level and the resistance force increases\nsubstantially, due to the osmotic pressure build-up. To achieve a steady-state\ntransport, the apparatus that injects new particles into a crowded channel has\nto operate with an increasing power consumption, proportional to the length of\nthe channel and the required rate of transport. The analysis of resistance\nforce, and accordingly -- the power required to inject the particles into a\ncrowded channel to oversome its clogging, is also relevant for many\nmicrofluidics applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Jul 2013 02:24:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-24"}

This\ncontrasts sharply with the generic solutions of the crystallographic theory\nwhich have at most two such volume fractions for a given twin system of the\nform $f^*$ and $1-f^*$. In this paper we simplify the form of the cofactor\nconditions, we give their specific forms for various symmetries and twin types,\nwe clarify the extent to which the satisfaction of the cofactor conditions for\none twin system implies its satisfaction for other twin systems. In particular,\nwe prove that the satisfaction of the cofactor conditions for either Type I or\nType II twins implies that there are solutions of the crystallographic theory\nusing these twins that have no elastic transition layer. We show that the\nlatter further implies macroscopically curved, transition-layer-free\naustenite/martensite interfaces for Type I twins, and planar\ntransition-layer-free interfaces for Type II twins which nevertheless permit\nsignificant flexibility of the martensite.

The brick wall model suggests that without an appropriate near horizon\nIR cut-off, the free energy of the probe fields show the divergence due to the\nlarge degenerate states near the horizons. After studying the universal nature\nof the divergence in various holographic setting in various dimensions, we\ninterpret the nature of the divergence in a holographic context. The free\nenergy divergence is due to the large degeneracy and continuity of the low\nenergy spectrum in the boundary theory at the deconfinement phase. These\ndivergence and continuity should be removed by finite N effects, which make the\nspectrum discrete even at the deconfinement phase. On the other hand, in the\nbulk, these degenerate states are localized near the horizon, and the universal\ndivergence of these degenerate states implies that the naive counting of the\ndegrees of freedom in bulk should be modified once we take into account the\nnon-perturbative quantum gravity effects near the horizon. Depending on the\nmicroscopic degrees of freedom, the position, where the effective field theory\ndescription to count the states breaks down, has different Planck scale\ndependence. It also implies the difficulty to have an electron like\ngauge-singlet elementary field in the boundary theory Lagrangian. These singlet\nfields are at most composite fields, because they show divergent free energy,\nsuggesting a positive power of N at the deconfinement phase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Jul 2013 03:14:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 Jan 2015 01:00:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-05"}

Using an effective description similar to bulk viscous cosmology, we\nformulate the modified Friedmann, acceleration, and continuity equations for\nentropic cosmology. Based on this formulation, we propose two entropic-force\nmodels derived from the Bekenstein and generalized entropies. In order to\nexamine the properties of the two models, we consider a homogeneous, isotropic,\nand spatially flat universe, focusing on a single-fluid-dominated universe.

The detection system consists of an\narray of microchannel plates (MCP) in combination with a phosphor screen which\nis read out by a CCD camera. This setup together with the ionization of a\ncluster beam by an electron or ion beam allows for spatial resolved\ninvestigations of the cluster beam position, size, and intensity. Moreover,\nsince electrically uncharged clusters remain undetected, the operation in an\ninternal beam experiment opens the way to monitor the overlap region and thus\nthe position and size of an accelerator beam crossing an originally\nelectrically neutral cluster jet. The observed intensity distribution of the\nrecorded image is directly proportional to the convolution of the spatial ion\nbeam and cluster beam intensities and is by this a direct measure of the\ntwo-dimensional luminosity distribution. This information can directly be used\nfor the reconstruction of vertex positions as well as for an input for\nnumerical simulations of the reaction zone. The spatial resolution of the\nimages are dominated by the granularity of the complete MCP device and was\nfound to be in the order of \\sigma~100 \\mu m.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Jul 2013 10:15:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

However the principle could be applied to\nother ions or ionized molecules as well. For the production of proton beams by\nstripping extraction of an $H_2^+$-beam, we discuss possible designs for three\ntypes of machines: First a low-energy cyclotron for the simultaneous production\nof several beams at multiple energies - for instance 15 MeV, 30 MeV and 70 MeV\n- thus allowing to have beam on several isotope production targets.

The correct\nterm is proportional to the square of the momentum.

To meet the\npractical requirement that energy receivers (ERs) operate with significantly\nhigher received power as compared to information receivers (IRs), ERs need to\nbe deployed in more proximity to the transmitter than IRs. However, due to the\nbroadcast nature of wireless channels, one critical issue arises that the\nmessages sent to IRs can be eavesdropped by ERs, which possess better channels\nfrom the transmitter. In this paper, we address this new secrecy communication\nproblem in a multiuser multiple-input single-output (MISO) SWIPT system where\none multi-antenna transmitter sends information and energy simultaneously to an\nIR and multiple ERs, each with one single antenna. To optimally design transmit\nbeamforming vectors and their power allocation, two problems are investigated\nwith different aims: the first problem maximizes the secrecy rate for IR\nsubject to individual harvested energy constraints of ERs, while the second\nproblem maximizes the weighted sum-energy transferred to ERs subject to a\nsecrecy rate constraint for IR. We solve these two non-convex problems\noptimally by reformulating each of them into a two-stage problem. First, by\nfixing the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) target for ERs (for\nthe first problem) or IR (for the second problem), we obtain the optimal\nbeamforming and power allocation solution by applying the technique of\nsemidefinite relaxation (SDR). Then, the original problems are solved by a\none-dimension search over the optimal SINR target for ERs or IR. Furthermore,\nfor each of the two studied problems, suboptimal solutions of lower complexity\nare also proposed in which the information and energy beamforming vectors are\nseparately designed with their power allocation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Jul 2013 14:49:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 26 Jul 2013 05:49:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 17 Jan 2014 07:40:54 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 21 Jan 2014 08:32:27 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 22 Jan 2014 15:23:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

We computed a small 3D grid of 150 fully line-blanketed, NLTE\nmodel atmospheres incorporating the 8 most abundant metals found in the\natmosphere of that star. We next compared quantitatively the synthetic spectra\nthat we calculated from these models with three observed spectra having\ndifferent resolutions (1 A, 6 A, and 8.7 A) and wavelength ranges.

These estimates are in good agreement with those of\nprevious studies, thus showing that the presence of metals do not affect\nsignificantly the bulk atmospheric properties of Feige 48.

Both the\nstructural and magnetic transitions are suppressed by Cu doping, and bulk\nsuperconductivity is induced by Cu doping. Superconducting transition\ntemperature ($T_c$) is initially enhanced from 9.6 to 11.5 K by Cu doping, and\nthen suppressed with further doping. A phase diagram similar to\nNaFe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$As is obtained except that insulating instead of metallic\nbehavior is observed in extremely overdoped samples. $T_c$'s of underdoped,\noptimally doped, and overdoped samples are all notably enhanced by applying\npressure. Although a universal maximum transition temperature ($T_c^{max}$) of\nabout 31 K under external pressure is observed in underdoped and optimally\ndoped NaFe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$As, $T_c^{max}$ of NaFe$_{1-x}$Cu$_x$As is monotonously\nsuppressed by Cu doping, suggesting that impurity potential of Cu is stronger\nthan Co in NaFeAs. The comparison between Cu and Co doping effect in NaFeAs\nindicates that Cu serves as an effective electron dopant with strong impurity\npotential, but part of the doped electrons are localized and do not fill the\nenergy bands as predicted by the rigid-band model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Jul 2013 15:25:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-30"}

In particular, we focus on the case\nwhere Eulerian measurements are obtained from the time and space evolving\nvector field, whose evolution obeys the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations\ndefined on a torus. This context is particularly relevant to the area of\nnumerical weather forecasting and data assimilation. We will adopt a Bayesian\nformulation resulting from a particular regularization that ensures the problem\nis well posed. In the context of Monte Carlo based inference, it is a\nchallenging task to obtain samples from the resulting high dimensional\nposterior on the initial condition. In real data assimilation applications it\nis common for computational methods to invoke the use of heuristics and\nGaussian approximations. The resulting inferences are biased and not\nwell-justified in the presence of non-linear dynamics and observations. On the\nother hand, Monte Carlo methods can be used to assimilate data in a principled\nmanner, but are often perceived as inefficient in this context due to the\nhigh-dimensionality of the problem. In this work we will propose a generic\nSequential Monte Carlo (SMC) sampling approach for high dimensional inverse\nproblems that overcomes these difficulties. The method builds upon Markov chain\nMonte Carlo (MCMC) techniques, which are currently considered as benchmarks for\nevaluating data assimilation algorithms used in practice. In our numerical\nexamples, the proposed SMC approach achieves the same accuracy as MCMC but in a\nmuch more efficient manner.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Jul 2013 15:39:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-24"}

Among many scalar-tensor theories of\ngravity, Brans-Dicke is the simplest and the impact of it can be regulated by\ntwo parameters associated with it, namely, the Brans-Dicke parameter, $\\omega$,\nand the potential-scalar field dependency parameter $n$ respectively. V.\nHusain's work on exact solution for null fluid collapse in 1996 has influenced\nmany authors to follow his way to find the end-state of the\nhomogeneous/in-homogeneous dust cloud. Vaidya's metric is used all over to\nfollow the nature of future outgoing radial null geodesics. Detecting whether\nthe central singularity is naked or wrapped by an event horizon, by the\nexistence of future directed radial null geodesic emitted in past from the\nsingularity is the basic objective. To point out the existence of positive\ntrajectory tangent solution, both particular parametric cases(through tabular\nforms) and wide range contouring process have been applied. Precisely, perfect\nfluid's EoS satisfies a wide range of phenomena : from dust to exotic fluid\nlike dark energy. We have used the EoS parameter $k$ to determine the end state\nof collapse in different cosmological era. Our main target is to check low\n$\\omega$ (more deviations from Einstein gravity-more Brans Dicke effect) and\nnegative $k$ zones. This particularly throws light on the nature of the\nend-state of collapse in accelerated expansion in Brans Dicke gravity. It is\nseen that for positive values of EoS parameter $k$, the collapse results in a\nblack hole, whereas for negative values of $k$, naked singularity is the only\noutcome. It is also to be noted that \"low $\\omega$\" leads to the possibility of\ngetting more naked singularities even for a non-accelerating universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Jul 2013 13:31:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 Aug 2014 13:14:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}
