It has been proposed that the rate\nof the E1M1 two-photon transition 2s2p ^3P_0 - 2s^2 ^1S_0 can be extracted from\nthe lifetime of the ^3P_0 state in Be-like ions with zero nuclear spin by\nemploying resonant recombination in a storage-ring.

The effect of this field needs\nto be evaluated in order to properly extract the two-photon rate from the\nmeasured decay curves. The magnetic field induced transition rates are\ncarefully evaluated and it is shown that, with a typical storage-ring field\nstrength, it is dominant or of the same order as the E1M1 rate for low- and\nmid-Z ions. Results for several field strengths and ions are presented and we\nalso give a simple Z-dependent formula for the rate.

Here, we answer an outstanding question: in light of the bounty of\nsmall planets transiting small stars uncovered by the Kepler mission, should\nMEarth have found more than just one planet so far? We estimate MEarth's\nensemble sensitivity to exoplanets by performing end-to-end simulations of 1.25\nmillion observations of 988 nearby mid-to-late M dwarfs, gathered by MEarth\nbetween October 2008 and June 2012.

As part\nof this analysis, we provide new analytic fits to the Kepler early M dwarf\nplanet occurrence distribution. When extrapolating between Kepler's early M\ndwarfs and MEarth's mid-to-late M dwarfs, we find that assuming the planet\noccurrence distribution stays fixed with respect to planetary equilibrium\ntemperature provides a good match to our detection of a planet with GJ1214b's\nobserved properties.

No consensus exists on\nthe effect of flaws on fracture in bulk nanostructured materials or in\nnanostructures. Proposed theories include nanoscale flaw tolerance and\nmaintaining macroscopic fracture relationships at the nanoscale with virtually\nno experimental support. We explore fracture mechanisms in nanomaterials via\nnanomechanical experiments on nanostructures with pre-fabricated surface flaws\nin combination with molecular dynamics simulations. Nanocrystalline Pt\ncylinders with diameters of 120 nm with intentionally introduced surface\nnotches were created using a template-assisted electroplating method and tested\nin uniaxial tension in in-situ SEM. Experiments demonstrate that 8 out of 12\nsamples failed at the notches and that tensile failure strengths were 1.8 GPa\nregardless of whether failure occurred at or away from the flaw. These findings\nsuggest that failure location was sensitive to the presence of flaws, while\nstrength was flaw-insensitive. Molecular dynamics simulations support these\nobservations and show that incipient plastic deformation commences via\nnucleation and motion of dislocations in concert with grain boundary sliding.\nWe postulate that such local plasticity reduces stress concentration ahead of\nthe flaw to levels comparable with the strengths of intrinsic microstructural\nfeatures like grain boundary triple junctions, a phenomenon unique to\nnano-scale solids that contain an internal microstructural energy landscape.\nThis mechanism causes failure to occur at the weakest link, be it an internal\ninhomogeneity or a surface feature with a high local stress.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Jul 2013 16:50:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-12"}

A remarkable\nvariety of candidate high-pressure ground states have been identified with an\nevolutionary crystal structure search, including a stable alkaline-earth\nmonoboride oI8-CaB, a superconductor with an expected critical temperature (Tc)\nof 5.5 K. We have extended our previous study of CaB6 [Phys. Rev. Lett. 108,\n102501 (2012)] to nearby stoichiometries of CaB[6+x], finding that extra boron\nfurther stabilizes the proposed B24 units. Here an explanation is given for the\ntransformation of cP7-CaB6 into the more complex oS56 and tI56 polymorphs at\nhigh pressure. The stability of the known metallic tP20 phase of CaB4 at\nambient pressure is explained from a crystal structure and chemical bonding\npoint of view. The tP20 structure is shown to destabilize at 19 GPa relative to\na semiconducting MgB4-like structure due to chemical pressure from the metal\nion. The hypothetical AlB2-type structure of CaB2, previously shown to have\nfavorable superconducting features, is demonstrated here to be unstable at all\npressures; two new metallic CaB2 polymorphs with unusual boron networks\nstabilize at elevated pressures above 8 GPa but are found to have very low\ncritical temperatures (Tc ~1 K). The stability of all structures has been\nrationalized through comparison with alkaline-earth analogs, emphasizing the\nimportance of the size of the metal ion for the stability of borides. Our study\nillustrates the inverse correlation between the thermodynamic stability and\nsuperconducting properties and the necessity to carefully examine both in the\ndesign of new synthesizable superconducting materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Jul 2013 18:49:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

The traditional likelihood-based estimators\nlack resilience against outliers, a critical issue when dealing with\nhigh-dimensional noisy data. Our method, Minimum Distance Lasso (MD-Lasso),\ncombines minimum distance functionals, customarily used in nonparametric\nestimation for their robustness, with l1-regularization for high-dimensional\nregression. The geometry of MD-Lasso is key to its consistency and robustness.\nThe estimator is governed by a scaling parameter that caps the influence of\noutliers: the loss per observation is locally convex and close to quadratic for\nsmall squared residuals, and flattens for squared residuals larger than the\nscaling parameter. As the parameter approaches infinity, the estimator becomes\nequivalent to least-squares Lasso. MD-Lasso enjoys fast convergence rates under\nmild conditions on the model error distribution, which hold for any of the\nsolutions in a convexity region around the true parameter and in certain cases\nfor every solution. Remarkably, a first-order optimization method is able to\nproduce iterates very close to the consistent solutions, with geometric\nconvergence and regardless of the initialization.

We performed a numerical analysis of the orbital\nevolution of a sample of particles under the influence of the solar radiation\nforce and the planetary oblateness, combined with the gravitational interaction\nwith the close satellites. The most likely result is a collisions and the\ndeposition of particles onto the surface of these satellites. Since this\nmechanism tends to cause a depletion of material of the rings, we investigate\nadditional sources for these dust particles. Adopting a rough estimative of the\nflux of interplanetary meteoroids, we found that the ejections from Mab could\ngenerate a ring with optical depth comparable with the observations.\n  A similar analysis was carried out for the F-ring dust band. The damping due\nto the Saturn's oblateness prevents the overstated changes of the eccentricity\nand increases in the lifetime of the particles. Therewithal photometric study\nof the F-ring using Cassini images revealed that substantial secular increase\nin the brightness of Saturn's F ring has occurred in the last 25 years. The\nshapes of the phase curves from Cassini and Voyager are similar, suggesting\nthat although the number of dust particles has increased, the overall\ndistribution of sizes is unchanged.\n  The dust bands that permeate the rings of Uranus were observed late in 2007\nduring the equinox, when the Sun crossed the ring plane.

This \"noise\" is typically correlated between pairs of cells, and a\nquestion with rich history in neuroscience is how these noise correlations\nimpact the population's ability to encode the stimulus. Here, we consider a\nvery general setting for population coding, investigating how information\nvaries as a function of noise correlations, with all other aspects of the\nproblem - neural tuning curves, etc. - held fixed. This work yields unifying\ninsights into the role of noise correlations. These are summarized in the form\nof theorems, and illustrated with numerical examples involving neurons with\ndiverse tuning curves. Our main contributions are as follows.\n  (1) We generalize previous results to prove a sign rule (SR) - if noise\ncorrelations between pairs of neurons have opposite signs vs. their signal\ncorrelations, then coding performance will improve compared to the independent\ncase. This holds for three different metrics of coding performance, and for\narbitrary tuning curves and levels of heterogeneity. This generality is true\nfor our other results as well.\n  (2) As also pointed out in the literature, the SR does not provide a\nnecessary condition for good coding. We show that a diverse set of correlation\nstructures can improve coding. Many of these violate the SR, as do\nexperimentally observed correlations. There is structure to this diversity: we\nprove that the optimal correlation structures must lie on boundaries of the\npossible set of noise correlations.\n  (3) We provide a novel set of necessary and sufficient conditions, under\nwhich the coding performance (in the presence of noise) will be as good as it\nwould be if there were no noise present at all.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Jul 2013 19:52:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 Jul 2013 19:49:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 22 Aug 2013 18:52:35 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 15 Jan 2014 23:46:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

We investigate the temporal\ndecay of the emission from GRB afterglows at late times, when the bulk of the\nshock-accelerated electrons are non-relativistic. For a uniform circumburst\nmedium, we show that such \"deep Newtonian phase\" begins at t_{DN} ~ 3\nepsilon_{e,-1}^{5/6} t_{ST}, where t_{ST} marks the transition of the blast\nwave to the non-relativistic spherically-symmetric Sedov-Taylor solution, and\nepsilon_e = 0.1 epsilon_{e,-1} quantifies the amount of shock energy\ntransferred to the post-shock electrons.

Recently, we showed that one-loop anomaly-mediated gaugino masses should\nbe associated with unbroken supersymmetry (SUSY). This counterintuitive result\narises because the underlying symmetry structure of (broken) SUGRA in flat\nspace is in fact (unbroken) SUSY in anti-de Sitter (AdS) space. When quantum\ncorrections are regulated in a way that preserves SUGRA, the underlying AdS\ncurvature (proportional to the gravitino mass) necessarily appears in the\nregulated action, yielding soft masses without corresponding goldstino\ncouplings. In this paper, we extend our analysis of anomaly mediation to\nsfermion soft masses. Already at tree-level we encounter a number of surprises,\nincluding the fact that zero soft masses correspond to broken (AdS) SUSY. At\none-loop, we explain how anomaly mediation appears when regulating SUGRA in a\nway that preserves super-Weyl invariance.

On the other hand, quantum time evolution of the same systems\ninvolves all energies and it is therefore thought to be much harder, if at all\npossible, to have sharp transitions in the dynamics. In this paper we show that\nphase transitions characterized by universal singularities do occur in the time\nevolution of random spin chains. The sharpness of the transitions and integrity\nof the phases owes to many-body localization, which prevents thermalization in\nthese systems. Using a renormalization group approach, we solve the time\nevolution of random Ising spin chains with generic interactions starting from\ninitial states of arbitrary energy. As a function of the Hamiltonian\nparameters, the system is tuned through a dynamical transition, similar to the\nground state critical point, at which the local spin correlations establish\ntrue long range temporal order. In the state with dominant transverse field, a\nspin that starts in an up state loses its orientation with time, while in the\n\"ordered\" state it never does. As in ground state quantum phase transitions,\nthe dynamical transition has unique signatures in the entanglement properties\nof the system. When the system is initialized in a product state the\nentanglement entropy grows as $log(t)$ in the two \"phases\", while at the\ncritical point it grows as $log^\\a(t)$, with $\\a$ a universal number. This\nuniversal entanglement growth requires generic (\"integrability breaking\")\ninteractions to be added to the pure transverse field Ising model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Jul 2013 20:00:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-11"}

The capture rate is well defined for spherical galaxies with nuclear\nrelaxation times that are shorter than the galaxy's age. However, even the\ndense nucleus of the Milky Way may be less than one relaxation time old, and\nthis is certainly the case for more massive galaxies; the capture rate in such\ngalaxies is an initial-value problem with poorly-known initial conditions and\nthe rate can be much higher, or much lower, than the rate in a collisionally\nrelaxed nucleus. In nonspherical (axisymmetric, triaxial) galaxies, torquing of\norbits by the mean field can dominate perturbations due to random encounters,\nleading to much higher capture rates than in the spherical geometry,\nparticularly in (massive) galaxies with long central relaxation times.\nRelativistic precession plays a crucial role in mediating the capture of\ncompact remnants from regions very near to the black hole, by destroying the\norbital correlations that would otherwise dominate the torques. The complex\ndynamics of relativistic loss cones are not yet well enough understood for\naccurate estimates of compact-object (EMRI) capture rates to be made.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Jul 2013 20:34:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Nov 2013 18:55:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 19 Nov 2013 14:40:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

In this paper, a concatenating\ncoding design for the $K$-user AWGN-BC with noisy feedback is proposed that\nrelies on linear feedback schemes to achieve rate tuples outside the\nno-feedback capacity region. Specifically, a linear feedback code for the\nAWGN-BC with noisy feedback is used as an inner code that creates an effective\nsingle-user channel from the transmitter to each of the receivers, and then\nopen-loop coding is used for coding over these single-user channels. An\nachievable rate region of linear feedback schemes for noiseless feedback is\nshown to be achievable by the concatenated coding scheme for sufficiently small\nfeedback noise level.

This paper focuses on the energy consumption issue in terms of\ncommunication between nodes whenever the localization information is\ntransmitted to a sink node. Tracking through WSNs can be categorized into\ncentralized and decentralized systems. Decentralized systems offer low power\nconsumption when deployed to track a small number of mobile targets compared to\nthe centralized tracking systems. However, in several applications, it is\nessential to position a large number of mobile targets. In such applications,\ndecentralized systems offer high power consumption, since the location of each\nmobile target is required to be transmitted to a sink node, and this increases\nthe power consumption for the whole WSN.

It is also possible that the analogies of the dust grains observed\ntoward the Galactic center is responsible for the steep reddening curve. In\naddition, we find that IRAS 14026+4341 is a weak emission-line quasar (i.e.,\nPHL 1811 analogies) with heavy dust reddening and blueshifted broad absorption\nlines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Jul 2013 02:40:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-15"}

Using a high-resolution N-body/SPH cosmological simulation, we find an\naccurate scaling relation between galaxy pair counts and merger rates down to a\nstellar mass ratio of about 1:30. The relation explicitly accounts for the\ndependence on redshift (or time), on pair separation, and on mass of the two\ngalaxies in a pair. With this relation, one can easily obtain the mean merger\ntimescale for a close pair of galaxies. The use of virial masses, instead of\nstellar masses, is motivated by the fact that the dynamical friction time scale\nis mainly determined by the dark matter surrounding central and satellite\ngalaxies. This fact can also minimize the error induced by uncertainties in\nmodeling star formation in the simulation. Since the virial mass can be read\nfrom the well-established relation between the virial masses and the stellar\nmasses in observation, our scaling relation can be easily applied to\nobservations to obtain the merger rate and merger time scale. For major merger\npairs (1:1-1:4) of galaxies above a stellar mass of 4*10^10 M_sun/h at z=0.1,\nit takes about 0.31 Gyr to merge for pairs within a projected distance of 20\nkpc/h with stellar mass ratio of 1:1, while the time taken goes up to 1.6 Gyr\nfor mergers with stellar mass ratio of 1:4. Our results indicate that a single\ntimescale usually used in literature is not accurate to describe mergers with\nthe stellar mass ratio spanning even a narrow range from 1:1 to 1:4.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Jul 2013 04:54:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 Jul 2013 14:11:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 23 May 2014 04:47:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

Momentum degradation of the hard and semihard partons as they traverse\nthe inhomogeneous medium at various azimuthal angles results in a complicated\nconvolution of geometrical, nuclear and dynamical factors that cannot usually\nbe described in a transparent way. In this work a compact formula is found that\nrepresents the inclusive distributions of minijets of any parton type at the\nsurface of the medium for any collision centrality. They take into account the\ncontributions from all initiating partons created at any point in the medium.\nBy comparing with the case of no energy loss, a ratio has been determined that\nis analogous to the nuclear modification factor for minijets. Phenomenological\nreality of such distributions is examined by calculating the hadronization of\nthe minijets in the recombination model. Good fits of the data on pion, kaon\nand proton production throughout the intermediate \\ppt\\ region have been\nobtained by adjusting the parameters controlling the magnitude of the thermal\npartons and the degradation rates of the semihard partons. The result gives\nsupport to the minijet spectra at any centrality on the one hand, and the\nhadronization procedure used on the other. An important property made manifest\nin this study is that quarks and gluons must not lose energy in the same way\nbecause the partons form mesons and baryons differently by recombination and\nthe momenta of quarks and gluons must be degraded at different rates in order\nto reproduce the experimental pion and proton spectra. This is a feature that\nrenders invalid the notion of parton-hadron duality or other hadronization\nschemes based on similar ideas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Jul 2013 05:23:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

Since current PINs are noisy, their computational\nde-noising via link prediction (LP) could improve the learning accuracy. LP\nuses the existing PIN topology to predict missing and spurious links. Many of\nexisting LP methods rely on shared immediate neighborhoods of the nodes to be\nlinked. As such, they have limitations. Thus, in order to comprehensively study\nwhat are the topological properties of nodes in PINs that dictate whether the\nnodes should be linked, we had to introduce novel sensitive LP measures that\novercome the limitations of the existing methods.\n  We systematically evaluate the new and existing LP measures by introducing\n\"synthetic\" noise to PINs and measuring how well the different measures\nreconstruct the original PINs. Our main findings are: 1) LP measures that favor\nnodes which are both \"topologically similar\" and have large shared extended\nneighborhoods are superior; 2) using more network topology often though not\nalways improves LP accuracy; and 3) our new LP measures are superior to the\nexisting measures. After evaluating the different methods, we use them to\nde-noise PINs. Importantly, we manage to improve biological correctness of the\nPINs by de-noising them, with respect to \"enrichment\" of the predicted\ninteractions in Gene Ontology terms.

In contrast to states\nat integer filling fraction, such quantum liquids posses an additional dipole\nmoment localized near edges. It enters observable quantities such as universal\ndispersion of edge states and Lorentz shear stress. For a Laughlin state, this\nbehavior is seen as a peak, or overshoot, in the single particle density near\nthe edge, reflecting a general tendency of electrons in FQH states to cluster\nnear edges. We compute the singular edge behavior of the one particle density\nby a perturbative expansion carried out around a completely filled Landau\nlevel.

The combination of the two distortions is responsible for\nstabilizing the strongly orthorhombic $A$-AFM insulating ($I$) $Pbnm$ ground\nstate relative to a metallic ferromagnetic (FM-$M$) phase. However, epitaxial\nstrain due to coherent matching to a crystalline substrate can change the\nrelative stability of the two states. In particular, coherent matching to a\nsquare-lattice substrate favors the less orthorhombic FM-$M$ phase, with the\n$A$-AFM phase stabilized at higher values of tensile epitaxial strain due to\nits larger volume per formula unit, resulting in a coupled magnetic and\nmetal-insulator transition at a critical strain close to 1%. At the phase\nboundary, colossal magneto-resistance is expected. Tensile epitaxial strain\nenhances the JT distortion and opens the band gap in the $A$-AFM-$I$ $c$-$Pbnm$\nphase, offering the opportunity for band-gap engineering. Compressive epitaxial\nstrain induces an orientational transition within the FM-$M$ phase from\n$c$-$Pbnm$ to $ab$-$Pbnm$ with a change in the direction of the magnetic easy\naxis relative to the substrate, yielding strain-controlled magnetization at the\nphase boundary. The strong couplings between the JT distortion, the\noxygen-octahedron rotations and the magnetic and electronic properties, and\nassociated functional behavior, motivate interest in other orthorhombic $Pbnm$\nperovskites with large JT distortions, which should also exhibit a rich variety\nof coupled magnetic, structural and electronic phase transitions driven by\nepitaxial strain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Jul 2013 06:48:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-04"}

This combination\ndefines a new class of feed-forward loops (FFLs) in which the microRNA plays\nthe role of master regulator. Using both deterministic and stochastic equations\nwe show that these FFLs are indeed able not only to fine-tune the TF/target\nratio to any desired value as a function of the miRNA concentration but also,\nthanks to the peculiar topology of the circuit, to ensures the stability of\nthis ratio against stochastic fluctuations. These two effects are due to the\ninterplay between the direct transcriptional regulation and the indirect\nTF/Target interaction due to competition of TF and target for miRNA binding\n(the so called \"sponge effect\"). We then perform a genome wide search of these\nFFLs in the human regulatory network and show that they are characterizedby a\nvery peculiar enrichment pattern. In particular they are strongly enriched in\nall the situations in which the TF and its target have to be precisely kept at\nthe same concentration notwithstanding the environmental noise. As an example\nwe discuss the FFL involving E2F1 as Transcription Factor, RB1 as target and\nmiR-17 family as master regulator.

Analyses of gene expression or sequence data, which\nhave been indispensable for investigating aging, have been limited to studying\ngenes and their protein products in isolation, ignoring their connectivities.\nHowever, proteins function by interacting with other proteins, and this is\nexactly what biological networks (BNs) model. Thus, analyzing the proteins' BN\ntopologies could contribute to understanding of aging. Current methods for\nanalyzing systems-level BNs deal with their static representations, even though\ncells are dynamic. For this reason, and because different data types can give\ncomplementary biological insights, we integrate current static BNs with\naging-related gene expression data to construct dynamic, age-specific BNs.\nThen, we apply sensitive measures of topology to the dynamic BNs to study\ncellular changes with age.\n  Results: While global BN topologies do not significantly change with age,\nlocal topologies of a number of genes do. We predict such genes as\naging-related. We demonstrate credibility of our predictions by: 1) observing\nsignificant overlap between our predicted aging-related genes and \"ground\ntruth\" aging-related genes; 2) showing that our aging-related predictions group\nby functions and diseases that are different than functions and diseases of\ngenes that are not predicted as aging-related; 3) observing significant overlap\nbetween functions and diseases that are enriched in our aging-related\npredictions and those that are enriched in \"ground truth\" aging-related data;\n4) providing evidence that diseases which are enriched in our aging-related\npredictions are linked to human aging; and 5) validating all of our\nhigh-scoring novel predictions via manual literature search.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Jul 2013 09:28:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-15"}

These nodes\ncan communicate without using ad hoc, instead these nodes form an arbitrary\ntopology (BSS/ESS) in which these nodes play the role of routers. Though the\nefficiency of Infrastructure networks is high, they are highly vulnerable to\nsecurity attacks. Detecting/Preventing these attacks over the network is highly\nchallenging task. Many solutions are proposed to provide authentication,\nconfidentiality, availability, secure routing and intrusion avoidance in\ninfrastructure networks. Providing security in such dynamically changing\nnetworks is a hard task. Characteristic of infrastructure network should also\nbe taken into consideration in order to design efficient solutions. In this\nstudy, we focus on efficiently increasing the flow transmission confidentiality\nin infrastructure networks based on multi-path routing. In order to increase\nconfidentiality of transmitted data, we take advantage of the existence of\nmultiple paths between nodes in an infrastructure network with the help of\nAccess Point. In this approach the original data is split into package and are\nforwarded through access point. The encrypted packets are then forwarded in\ndifferent disjoint paths that exist between sender and receiver. Even if an\nattacker succeeds to obtain one or more transmitted packets, the probability of\nreconstructing the original message is very low.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Jul 2013 10:39:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-15"}

In the last decades, a major effort has\nbeen achieved on theoretical and experimental levels and allowed to constraint,\nwith very high precision, parton distribution functions except strange quark\ndistribution, which still carries large uncertainties. Fragmentation functions,\nhowever, remain at a very preliminary stage of study with a growing interest in\na more accurate and precise knowledge. Nowadays, while pion fragmentation\nfunctions are known with a limited precision and kaon fragmentation functions\nare poorly known, the situation for dihadron fragmentation functions turns out\nto be behind the schedule and no studies or measurements have been yet\nperformed.Measuring both single hadron and hadron pair multiplicities in\nsemi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering at COMPASS represent a fundamental\ncontribution towards a better understanding of the hadronization process and a\nfirst measurement for hadron pair multiplicities in SIDIS.

With an understanding\nof physical conditions under which molecules have high abundance, they can be\nused as direct tracers of distinct physical regions. In particular, DCO+ is\nexpected to have an enhanced abundance within a few Kelvin of the CO freezeout\ntemperature of 19 K, making it a useful probe of the cold disk midplane. We\ncompare ALMA line observations of HD 163296 to a grid of models. We vary the\nupper- and lower-limit temperatures of the region in which DCO+ is present as\nwell as the abundance of DCO+ in order to fit channel maps of the DCO+ J=5-4\nline. To determine the abundance enhancement compared to the general\ninterstellar medium, we carry out similar fitting to HCO+ J=4-3 and H13CO+\nJ=4-3 observations. ALMA images show centrally peaked extended emission from\nHCO+ and H13CO+. DCO+ emission lies in a resolved ring from ~110 to 160 AU. The\nouter radius approximately corresponds to the size of the CO snowline as\nmeasured by previous lower resolution observations of CO lines in this disk.\nThe ALMA DCO+ data now resolve and image the CO snowline directly. In the best\nfitting models, HCO+ exists in a region extending from the 19 K isotherm to the\nphotodissociation layer with an abundance of 3x10^-10 relative to H2. DCO+\nexists within the 19-21 K region of the disk with an abundance ratio [DCO+] /\n[HCO+] = 0.3. This represents a factor of 10^4 enhancement of the DCO+\nabundance within this narrow region of the HD 163296 disk. Such a high\nenhancement has only previously been seen in prestellar cores.

We revisit the\nimpact of this effect on imaging quality and study a new algorithmic strategy\nto deal with the associated operator in the image reconstruction process. In\nprevious studies it has been shown that image recovery in the framework of\ncompressed sensing is improved due to the spread spectrum effect, where the\nw-modulation can act to increase the incoherence between measurement and\nsparsifying signal representations. For the purpose of computational\nefficiency, idealised experiments were performed, where only a constant\nbaseline component w in the pointing direction of the telescope was considered.\nWe extend this analysis to the more realistic setting where the w-component\nvaries for each visibility measurement. Firstly, incorporating varying\nw-components into imaging algorithms is a computational demanding task. We\npropose a variant of the w-projection algorithm for this purpose, which is\nbased on an adaptive sparsification procedure, and incorporate it in compressed\nsensing imaging methods. This sparse matrix variant of the w-projection\nalgorithm is generic and adapts to the support of each kernel. Consequently, it\nis applicable for all types of direction-dependent effects. Secondly, we show\nthat for w-modulation with varying w-components, reconstruction quality is\nsignificantly improved compared to the setting where there is no w-modulation\n(i.e. w=0), reaching levels comparable to the quality of a constant, maximal\nw-component. This finding confirms that one may seek to optimise future\ntelescope configurations to promote large w-components, thus enhancing the\nspread spectrum effect and consequently the fidelity of image reconstruction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Jul 2013 11:56:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 Nov 2013 15:58:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-27"}

Any other\nconfiguration is regarded as being subjective and a property of the a priori\nprobability distribution. We study NC in two specific settings. In the first\ncase, a complete description of some individuals is known, e.g. one knows of\neach of a group of individuals whether they are black and whether they are\nravens. In the second case, the number of individuals having a particular\nproperty is given, e.g. one knows how many ravens or how many black things\nthere are (in the relevant population). While some of the most famous answers\nto the paradox are measure-dependent, our discussion is not restricted to any\nparticular probability measure. Our most interesting result is that in the\nsecond setting, NC violates a simple kind of inductive inference (namely\nprojectability). Since relative to NC, this latter rule is more closely related\nto, and more directly justified by our intuitive notion of inductive reasoning,\nthis tension makes a case against the plausibility of NC. In the end, we\nsuggest that the informal representation of NC may seem to be intuitively\nplausible because it can easily be mistaken for reasoning by analogy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Jul 2013 12:28:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Jul 2013 02:22:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-17"}

There are six PfHsp70s, all of which have orthologues in other\nplasmodial species, except for PfHsp70-x which is unique to P. falciparum. This\npaper highlights a number of original results obtained by a detailed\nbioinformatics analysis of the protein. Large scale sequence analysis indicated\nthe presence of an extended transit peptide sequence of PfHsp70-x which\npotentially directs it to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Further analysis\nshowed that PfHsp70-x does not have an ER-retention sequence, suggesting that\nthe protein transits through the ER and is secreted into the parasitophorous\nvacuole (PV) or beyond into the erythrocyte cytosol. These results are\nconsistent with experimental findings. Next, possible interactions between\nPfHsp70-x and exported P. falciparum Hsp40s or host erythrocyte DnaJs were\ninterrogated by modeling and docking. Docking results indicated that\ninteraction between PfHsp70-x and each of the Hsp40s, regardless of biological\nfeasibility, seems equally likely. This suggests that J domain might not\nprovide the specificity in the formation of unique Hsp70-Hsp40 complexes, but\nthat the specificity might be provided by other domains of Hsp40s. By studying\ndifferent structural conformations of PfHsp70-x, it was shown that Hsp40s can\nonly bind when PfHsp70-x is in a certain conformation. Additionally, this work\nhighlighted the possible dependence of the substrate binding domain residues on\nthe orientation of the {\\alpha}-helical lid for formation of the substrate\nbinding pocket.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Jul 2013 13:04:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-15"}

Hints of emission at tens of GeV are indeed known since the\nEGRET observations during the '90s and confirmed in the Fermi-LAT data.\nHowever, our comprehension of these phenomena is still far to be satisfactory.\nIn this respect, the VHE characterization of GRBs may constitute a breakthrough\nfor understanding their physics and, possibly, for providing decisive clues for\nthe discrimination among different proposed emission mechanisms, which are\nbarely distinguishable at lower energies.

It is the case when theoretical analysis of prediction is\npossible. Quite recently a specific IET- model was suggested for dynamic\nprobabilistic prediction of M > 5.5 events in Italy . In this study we analyze\nboth some aspects of the statistical estimation of the model and its predictive\nability. We find that more or less effective prediction is possible within 4\nout of 34 seismotectonic zones where seismicity rate or clustering of events is\nrelatively high. We show that, in the framework of the model, one can suggest a\nsimple zone independent strategy, which practically optimizes the relative\nnumber of nonaccidental successes, or the Hanssen-Kuiper, HK, skill score. This\nquasi-optimal strategy declares alarm in a zone for the first 2.67 years just\nafter the occurrence of each large event in the zone. The optimal HK skill\nscore values are: 26% for the 3 most active zones and 2-10% for the 26 least\nactive zones. However, the number of false alarm time intervals per one event\nin each of the zones is unusually high: 0.7 and 0.8-0.95 respectively. Both\nthese theoretical estimations are important because any prospective testing of\nthe model is unrealistic in most of the zones during a reasonable time. This\nparticular analysis requires a discussion of the following issues of general\ninterest: a specific approach to the analysis of predictions vs. the standard\nCSEP testing approach; prediction vs. forecasting; HK skill score vs.\nprobability gain; the total forecast error diagram and connected false alarms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Jul 2013 14:10:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

The basic\nconjecture underlying the Bogolyubov approach is the functional hypothesis,\naccording to which, the many-particle distribution functions are assumed to be\nfunctionals of the one-particle distribution function on kinetic time scales.\nAnother ingredient in the Bogolyubov approach is the principle of the spatial\nweakening of correlations, which reflects statistical independence of physical\nvalues at distant spatial points. One can consider it as a reasonable mixing\nproperty of many-particle distribution functions. The motivation behind the\ngeneralization of Bogolyubov's approach to (classical) many-body dissipative\nsystems is the wish to describe the dynamics of granular systems, in particular\ngranular fluids. To this end we first define a general dissipative fluid\nthrough a dissipation function, thereby generalizing the commonly employed\nmodels for granular fluids. Using the Bogolyubov functional hypothesis we show\nhow a reduction of the pertinent BBGKY hierarchy can be achieved. The method is\nthen employed to cases which can be treated perturbatively, such as those in\nwhich the interactions are weak or the dissipation is small or the particle\ndensity is small. Kinetic descriptions are obtained in all of these limiting\ncases. As a test case, we show that the Bogolyubov method begets the now\nstandard inelastic Boltzmann equation for dilute monodisperse collections of\nspheres whose collisions are characterized by a fixed coefficient of normal\nrestitution. Possible further applications and implications are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Jul 2013 14:18:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-15"}

Efficient upconversion of rf-signals to an\noptical carrier would allow transmitting them via optical fibers dramatically\nreducing losses, and give access to the mature toolbox of quantum optical\ntechniques, routinely enabling quantum-limited signal detection. Research in\nthe field of cavity optomechanics has shown that nanomechanical oscillators can\ncouple very strongly to either microwave or optical fields. An oscillator\naccommodating both functionalities would bear great promise as the intermediate\nplatform in a radio-to-optical transduction cascade. Here, we demonstrate such\nan opto-electro-mechanical transducer utilizing a high-Q nanomembrane. A\nmoderate voltage bias (<10V) is sufficient to induce strong coupling between\nthe voltage fluctuations in a rf resonance circuit and the membrane's\ndisplacement, which is simultaneously coupled to light reflected off its\nmetallized surface. The circuit acts as an antenna; the voltage signals it\ninduces are detected as an optical phase shift with quantum-limited\nsensitivity.

This approach allows us to\nstudy the effects of features in the power-spectrum and in the bispectrum of\ncurvature perturbations, from a model-independent point of view, by\nparametrizing the features directly with modified \"slow-roll\" parameters. We\ncan obtain a self-consistent power-spectrum, together with enhanced\nnon-Gaussianity, which grows with a quantity $\\beta$ that parametrizes the\nsharpness of the step. With this treatment it is straightforward to generalize\nand include features in other coefficients of the effective action of the\ninflaton field fluctuations. Our conclusion in this case is that, excluding\nextrinsic curvature terms, the only interesting effects at the level of the\nbispectrum could arise from features in the first slow-roll parameter\n$\\epsilon$ or in the speed of sound $c_s$. Finally, we derive an upper bound on\nthe parameter $\\beta$ from the consistency of the perturbative expansion of the\naction for inflaton perturbations. This constraint can be used for an\nestimation of the signal-to-noise ratio, to show that the observable which is\nmost sensitive to features is the power-spectrum. This conclusion would change\nif we consider the contemporary presence of a feature and a speed of sound $c_s\n< 1$, as, in such a case, contributions from an oscillating folded\nconfiguration can potentially make the bispectrum the leading observable for\nfeature models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Jul 2013 15:07:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Oct 2013 10:30:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

To overcome the deficiencies in\ntraditional algorithms, this work proposes a Bayesian approach to on-line state\nand parameter estimation.

The simultaneous estimation is performed by filtering an\nextended vector of states and parameters using an adaptive\nsequential-importance-resampling (SIR) filter with a kernel density estimation\nmethod. The approach uses an on-line optimization algorithm based on\nKullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to allow adaptation of the SIR filter for\ncombined state-parameter estimation.

But this may be inappropriate for many of today's large-scale\nscreening problems, where auxiliary information about each test is often\navailable, and where a combined analysis can lead to poorly calibrated error\nrates within different subsets of the experiment. To address this issue, we\nintroduce an approach called false-discovery-rate regression that directly uses\nthis auxiliary information to inform the outcome of each test. The method can\nbe motivated by a two-groups model in which covariates are allowed to influence\nthe local false discovery rate, or equivalently, the posterior probability that\na given observation is a signal. This poses many subtle issues at the interface\nbetween inference and computation, and we investigate several variations of the\noverall approach. Simulation evidence suggests that: (1) when covariate effects\nare present, FDR regression improves power for a fixed false-discovery rate;\nand (2) when covariate effects are absent, the method is robust, in the sense\nthat it does not lead to inflated error rates. We apply the method to neural\nrecordings from primary visual cortex. The goal is to detect pairs of neurons\nthat exhibit fine-time-scale interactions, in the sense that they fire together\nmore often than expected due to chance. Our method detects roughly 50% more\nsynchronous pairs versus a standard FDR-controlling analysis. The companion R\npackage FDRreg implements all methods described in the paper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Jul 2013 15:55:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 28 Jul 2013 03:30:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 8 Jun 2014 22:27:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-10"}

The nodes can\ncommunicate without an ad hoc. They form an uninformed topology (BSS/ESS),\nwhere the nodes play the role of routers and are free to move randomly.\nInfrastructure networks proved their efficiency being used in different fields\nbut they are highly vulnerable to security attacks and dealing with this is one\nof the main challenges of these networks at present. In recent times some\nclarification are proposed to provide authentication, confidentiality,\navailability, secure routing and intrusion avoidance in infrastructure\nnetworks. Implementing security in such dynamically changing networks is a hard\ntask. Infrastructure network characteristics should be taken into consideration\nto be clever to design efficient solutions.
