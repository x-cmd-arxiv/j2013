While this popular view\ndoes not tell the whole story behind the early beginnings of IXPs, what is true\nis that since around 1994, the number of operational IXPs worldwide has grown\nto more than 300 (as of May 2013), with the largest IXPs handling daily traffic\nvolumes comparable to those carried by the largest Tier-1 ISPs, but IXPs have\nnever really attracted any attention from the networking research community. At\nfirst glance, this lack of interest seems understandable as IXPs have\napparently little to do with current \"hot\" topic areas such as data centers and\ncloud services or software defined networking (SDN) and mobile communication.\nHowever, we argue in this article that, in fact, IXPs are all about data\ncenters and cloud services and even SDN and mobile communication and should be\nof great interest to networking researchers interested in understanding the\ncurrent and future Internet ecosystem. To this end, we survey the existing but\nlargely unknown sources of publicly available information about IXPs to\ndescribe their basic technical and operational aspects and highlight the\ncritical differences among the various IXPs in the different regions of the\nworld, especially in Europe and North America. More importantly, we illustrate\nthe important role that IXPs play in today's Internet ecosystem and discuss how\nIXP-driven innovation in Europe is shaping and redefining the Internet\nmarketplace, not only in Europe but increasingly so around the world.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Jul 2013 16:00:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 27 Jul 2013 16:52:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-30"}

The\nsevere drought in the US in the summer of 2012 led to a new increase in food\nprices. Through the fall, they remained at a threshold above which the riots\nand revolutions had predominantly occurred. Global prices at this level create\nconditions where an exacerbating local circumstance can trigger unrest. Global\ncorn (maize) prices reached new highs, and countries that depend mostly on\nmaize are more likely to experience high local food prices and associated\npressures toward social unrest. Here we analyze the conditions in South Africa,\nwhich is a heavily maize-dependent country. Coinciding with increased consumer\nfood indices this summer, massive labor strikes in mining and agriculture have\nled to the greatest single incident of social violence since the fall of\napartheid in 1994. Worker demands for dramatic pay increases reflect that their\nwages have not kept up with drastic increases in the prices of necessities,\nespecially food. Without attention to the global food price situation, more\nincidents of food-based social instability are likely to arise. Other countries\nthat have manifested food-related protests and riots in 2012 include Haiti and\nArgentina. Moreover, these cases of unrest are just the most visible symptom of\nwidespread suffering of poor populations worldwide due to elevated food prices.\nPolicy decisions that would directly impact food prices are decreasing the\nconversion of maize to ethanol in the US, and reimposing regulations on\ncommodity futures markets to prevent excessive speculation, which we have shown\ncauses bubbles and crashes in these markets. Absent such policy actions,\ngovernments and companies should track and mitigate the impact of high and\nvolatile food prices on citizens and employees.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Jul 2013 16:08:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-22"}

Apart from its unexpected upper\ncritical dimension 6, it displays a singularity at fixed distance from the\norigin and is clearly the first step in a richer set of yet to be discovered\nmulti-scaling limits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Jul 2013 17:01:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

Multiple molecular outflows\nand Herbig-Haro (HH) objects have been observed in Orion, many of them\noriginating from the embedded massive star-forming region known as OMC1-S. The\ndetection of the outflow driving sources is commonly difficult, because they\nare still hidden behind large extinction, preventing their direct observation\nat optical and even near and mid-IR wavelengths. With the aim of improving the\nidentification of the driving sources of the multiple outflows detected in\nOMC1-S, we used the catalog provided by deep X-ray observations, which have\nunveiled the very embedded population of pre-main sequence stars. We compared\nthe position of stars observed by the Chandra Orion Ultra Deep project (COUP)\nin OMC1-S with the morphology of the molecular outflows and the directions of\nmeasured proper motions of HH optical objects. We find that 6 out of 7\nmolecular outflows reported in OMC1-S (detection rate of 86 %) have an\nextincted X-ray COUP star located at the expected position of the driving\nsource. In several cases, X-rays detected the possible driving sources for the\nfirst time. This clustered embedded population revealed by Chandra is very\nyoung, with an estimated average age of few 10^{5} yr. It is also likely\nresponsible for the multiple HH objects, which are the optical correspondence\nof flows arising from the cloud. We show that the molecular outflows driven by\nthe members of the OMC1-S cluster can account for the observed turbulence at\ncore-scales and regulate the star formation efficiency. We discuss the effects\nof outflow feedback in the formation of massive stars, concluding that the\ninjected turbulence in OMC1-S is compatible with a competitive accretion\nscenario.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Jul 2013 17:23:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

The goal of both is to decide on\nfractions of each number they want to keep so as to maximize the weighted\nfractional sum of the numbers chosen.\n  The classic result of Krengel and Sucheston (1977-78) asserts that if both\nthe gambler and the prophet can pick one number, then the gambler can do at\nleast half as well as the prophet. Recently, Kleinberg and Weinberg (2012) have\ngeneralized this result to settings where the numbers that can be chosen are\nsubject to a matroid constraint.\n  In this note we go one step further and show that the bound carries over to\nsettings where the fractions that can be chosen are subject to a polymatroid\nconstraint. This bound is tight as it is already tight for the simple setting\nwhere the gambler and the prophet can pick only one number. An interesting\napplication of our result is in mechanism design, where it leads to improved\nresults for various problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Jul 2013 18:11:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-22"}

The main goal of this study is to review the most widely used\nempirical oxygen calibrations, O3N2 and N2, by using new direct abundance\nmeasurements. We pay special attention to the expected uncertainty of these\ncalibrations as a function of the index value or abundance derived and the\npresence of possible systematic offsets. This is possible thanks to the\nanalysis of the most ambitious compilation of Te-based HII regions to date.\nThis new dataset compiles the Te-based abundances of 603 HII regions extracted\nfrom the literature but also includes new measurements from the CALIFA survey.\nBesides providing new and improved empirical calibrations for the gas\nabundance, we also present here a comparison between our revisited calibrations\nwith a total of 3423 additional CALIFA HII complexes with abundances derived\nusing the ONS calibration by Pilyugin et al. (2010). The combined analysis of\nTe-based and ONS abundances allows us to derive their most accurate calibration\nto date for both the O3N2 and N2 single-ratio indicators, in terms of all\nstatistical significance, quality and coverage of the space of parameters. In\nparticular, we infer that these indicators show shallower abundance\ndependencies and statistically-significant offsets compared to those of Pettini\nand Pagel (2004), Nagao et al.

Our search takes advantage of the consecutive g/r-band observations\n(16.5 min in each filter), by requiring detections in both bands, with\nnon-detections on preceding and subsequent nights. We identify 19 transients\nbrighter than 22.5 AB mag (S/N>10). Of these, 11 events exhibit quiescent\ncounterparts in the deep PS1/MDS templates that we identify as M4-M9 dwarfs.\nThe remaining 8 transients exhibit a range of properties indicative of\nmain-belt asteroids near the stationary point of their orbits. With\nidentifications for all 19 transients, we place an upper limit of\nR_FOT(0.5hr)<0.12 deg^-2 d^-1 (95% confidence level) on the sky-projected rate\nof extragalactic fast transients at <22.5 mag, a factor of 30-50 times lower\nthan previous limits; the limit for a timescale of ~day is R_FOT<2.4e-3 deg^-2\nd^-1. To convert these sky-projected rates to volumetric rates, we explore the\nexpected peak luminosities of fast optical transients powered by various\nmechanisms, and find that non-relativistic events are limited to M~-10 mag\n(M~-14 mag) for a timescale of ~0.5 hr (~day), while relativistic sources\n(e.g., GRBs, magnetar-powered transients) can reach much larger luminosities.\nThe resulting volumetric rates are <13 (M~-10 mag), <0.05 (M~-14 mag) and <1e-6\nMpc^-3 yr^-1 (M~-24 mag), significantly above the nova, supernova, and GRB\nrates, respectively, indicating that much larger surveys are required to\nprovide meaningful constraints.

A novel\nnumerical algorithm is implemented in the SPH code GADGET-3, to prevent the\nexpansion of a hole in the gas distribution around the BH.

At z=0.34 this burst\naffords an excellent opportunity to study the supernova and host galaxy\nassociated with an intrinsically extremely luminous burst ($E_{iso} >10^{54}$\nerg): more luminous than any previous GRB with a spectroscopically associated\nsupernova. We use the combination of the image quality, UV capability and and\ninvariant PSF of HST to provide the best possible separation of the afterglow,\nhost and supernova contributions to the observed light ~17 rest-frame days\nafter the burst utilising a host subtraction spectrum obtained 1 year later.\nAdvanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) grism observations show that the associated\nsupernova, SN~2013cq, has an overall spectral shape and luminosity similar to\nSN 1998bw (with a photospheric velocity, v$_{ph}$ ~15,000 km/s). The positions\nof the bluer features are better matched by the higher velocity SN~2010bh\n(v$_{ph}$ ~ 30,000 km/s), but SN 2010bh is significantly fainter, and fails to\nreproduce the overall spectral shape, perhaps indicative of velocity structure\nin the ejecta. We find that the burst originated ~4 kpc from the nucleus of a\nmoderately star forming (1 Msol/yr), possibly interacting disc galaxy. The\nabsolute magnitude, physical size and morphology of this galaxy, as well as the\nlocation of the GRB within it are also strikingly similar to those of\nGRB980425/SN 1998bw. The similarity of supernovae and environment from both the\nmost luminous and least luminous GRBs suggests broadly similar progenitor stars\ncan create GRBs across six orders of magnitude in isotropic energy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Jul 2013 21:15:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 Jul 2014 19:14:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

The graphical lasso, which involves maximizing the\nGaussian log likelihood subject to an l1 penalty, is a well-studied approach\nfor this task. We begin by introducing a surprising connection between the\ngraphical lasso and hierarchical clustering: the graphical lasso in effect\nperforms a two-step procedure, in which (1) single linkage hierarchical\nclustering is performed on the variables in order to identify connected\ncomponents, and then (2) an l1-penalized log likelihood is maximized on the\nsubset of variables within each connected component. In other words, the\ngraphical lasso determines the connected components of the estimated network\nvia single linkage clustering. Unfortunately, single linkage clustering is\nknown to perform poorly in certain settings. Therefore, we propose the cluster\ngraphical lasso, which involves clustering the features using an alternative to\nsingle linkage clustering, and then performing the graphical lasso on the\nsubset of variables within each cluster. We establish model selection\nconsistency for this technique, and demonstrate its improved performance\nrelative to the graphical lasso in a simulation study, as well as in\napplications to an equities data set, a university webpage data set, and a gene\nexpression data set.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Jul 2013 21:19:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-23"}

The Fawzi-Hayden-Sen (FHS) locking\nprotocol harnesses this effect in a cryptographic context, whereby one party\ncan encode n bits into n qubits while using only a constant-size secret key.\nThe encoded message is then secure against any measurement that an eavesdropper\ncould perform in an attempt to recover the message, but the protocol does not\nnecessarily meet the composability requirements needed in quantum key\ndistribution applications. In any case, the locking effect represents an\nextreme violation of Shannon's classical theorem, which states that\ninformation-theoretic security holds in the classical case if and only if the\nsecret key is the same size as the message. Given this intriguing phenomenon,\nit is of practical interest to study the effect in the presence of noise, which\ncan occur in the systems of both the legitimate receiver and the eavesdropper.\nThis paper formally defines the locking capacity of a quantum channel as the\nmaximum amount of locked information that can be reliably transmitted to a\nlegitimate receiver by exploiting many independent uses of a quantum channel\nand an amount of secret key sublinear in the number of channel uses.

A popular approach is to apply l1-penalties to either\n(1) parametric likelihoods, or, (2) regularized regression/pseudo-likelihoods,\nwith the latter having the distinct advantage that they do not explicitly\nassume Gaussianity. As none of the popular methods proposed for solving\npseudo-likelihood based objective functions have provable convergence\nguarantees, it is not clear if corresponding estimators exist or are even\ncomputable, or if they actually yield correct partial correlation graphs. This\npaper proposes a new pseudo-likelihood based graphical model selection method\nthat aims to overcome some of the shortcomings of current methods, but at the\nsame time retain all their respective strengths. In particular, we introduce a\nnovel framework that leads to a convex formulation of the partial covariance\nregression graph problem, resulting in an objective function comprised of\nquadratic forms. The objective is then optimized via a coordinate-wise\napproach. The specific functional form of the objective function facilitates\nrigorous convergence analysis leading to convergence guarantees; an important\nproperty that cannot be established using standard results, when the dimension\nis larger than the sample size, as is often the case in high dimensional\napplications. These convergence guarantees ensure that estimators are\nwell-defined under very general conditions, and are always computable. In\naddition, the approach yields estimators that have good large sample properties\nand also respect symmetry. Furthermore, application to simulated/real data,\ntiming comparisons and numerical convergence is demonstrated. We also present a\nnovel unifying framework that places all graphical pseudo-likelihood methods as\nspecial cases of a more general formulation, leading to important insights.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Jul 2013 07:01:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 26 Mar 2014 05:27:44 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 14 Aug 2014 21:15:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-04"}

Theoretical arguments and numerical simulations of radiative shocks\nproduced by the impact of the accreting gas onto young stars predict\nquasi-periodic oscillations in the emitted radiation. However, observational\ndata do not show evidence of such periodicity. Aims. We investigate whether\nphysically plausible perturbations in the accretion column or in the\nchromosphere could disrupt the shock structure influencing the observability of\nthe oscillatory behavior. Methods. We performed local 2D magneto-hydrodynamical\nsimulations of an accretion shock impacting a chromosphere, taking optically\nthin radiation losses and thermal conduction into account. We investigated the\neffects of several perturbation types, such as clumps in the accretion stream\nor chromospheric fluctuations, and also explored a wide range of plasma-\\beta\nvalues. Results. In the case of a weak magnetic field, the post-shock region\nshows chaotic motion and mixing, smoothing out the perturbations and retaining\na global periodic signature. On the other hand, a strong magnetic field\nconfines the plasma in flux tubes, which leads to the formation of fibrils that\noscillate independently. Realistic values for the amplitude, length, and time\nscales of the perturbation are capable of bringing the fibril oscillations out\nof phase, suppressing the periodicity of the emission. Conclusions. The\nstrength of a locally uniform magnetic field in YSO accretion shocks determines\nthe structure of the post-shock region, namely, whether it will be somewhat\nhomogeneous or if it will split up to form a collection of fibrils. In the\nsecond case, the size and shape of the fibrils is found to depend strongly on\nthe plasma-\\beta value but not on the perturbation type. Therefore, the actual\nvalue of the protostellar magnetic field is expected to play a critical role in\nthe time dependence of the observable emission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Jul 2013 08:51:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

We use a\nhomogeneous data set of the globular clusters in 23 ETGs obtained from the\nHST/ACS Virgo Cluster Survey. The position angles of both blue and red GCSs\nshow a correlation with those of the stellar light distribution, showing that\nthe major axes of the GCSs are well aligned with those of their host galaxies.\nHowever, the shapes of the red GCSs show a tight correlation with the stellar\nlight distribution as well as with the rotation property of their host\ngalaxies, while the shapes of the blue GCSs do much less. These provide clear\ngeometric evidence that the origins of the blue and red globular clusters are\ndistinct and that ETGs may have dual halos: a blue (metal-poor) halo and a red\n(metal-rich) halo. These two halos show significant differences in metallicity,\nstructure, and kinematics, indicating that they are formed in two\ndistinguishable ways.

Subsequently Davide Maglia in unpublished work investigated exactly what\npart of the structure and properties of a group G are needed to permit the\nconstruction of a braided monoidal category with a tangle algebra and was able\nto distinguish blocked two-torsions from the identity.\n  In this paper we present a simplification of his answer, which turns out to\nbe related to the notion of rack. We show that if G is a rack then there is a\nbraided monoidal category TRel_G generalizing that of the above paper. Further\nwe introduce a variation of the notion of rack which we call irack which yields\na tangle algebra in TRel_G. Iracks are in particular racks but have in addition\nto the operations abstracting group conjugation also a unary operation\nabstracting group inverse.

However, typically, identification of a regenerative structure in\nthese networks is difficult. A well known exception is when all the\ninterarrival times are exponentially distributed, where the instants\ncorresponding to customer arrivals to an empty network constitute a\nregenerative structure.

As an application of our methods, we prove that evey\ncompact subset of the positive cones of a C* algebra has an upper bound in the\nalgebra.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Jul 2013 15:31:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 29 Jul 2013 11:13:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-30"}

For example, massless photon has two\npolarization degrees of freedom, while massive photon at least three. This\nfeature seems counter-intuitive. In this paper we will show that if we change\npropagator by setting $i \\epsilon$ (needed to avoid poles) to a finite value,\nand also introduce it in a way that breaks Lawrentz symmetry, then we would\nobtain the continuous transition we desire once the speed of the photons is\n\"large enough\" with respect to \"preferred\" frame. The two transverse\npolarization degrees of freedom will be long lived, while longitudinal will be\nshort lived. Their lifetime will be near-zero if $m \\ll \\sqrt{\\epsilon}$, which\nis where the properties of two circular polarizations arize. The $i \\epsilon$\ncorresponds to the intensity of Mensky's \"continuous measurement\" and the short\nlifetime of the longitudinal photons can be understood as the \"conversion\" of\nquantum degrees of freedom (photons) into \"classical\" ones by the measurement\ndevice (thus getting rid of the former). While the \"classical\" trajectory of\nthe longitudinal photons does arize, it plays no physical role due to quantum\nZeno effect: intuitively, it is similar to an electron being kept at a ground\nstate due to continuous measurement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Jul 2013 18:53:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Aug 2013 17:03:44 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 10 Aug 2016 21:50:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-12"}
