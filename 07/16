A general scheme for the geometric study of parameter-space manifolds\nof eigenstates of complex Hamiltonians is outlined here, leading to generic\nexpressions for the metric.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Jul 2013 16:56:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-26"}

Magnetic feature death is a\nmeasurable proxy for the removal of detectable flux. We used the SWAMIS feature\ntracking code to understand how nearly 20000 detected magnetic features die in\nan hour-long sequence of Hinode/SOT/NFI magnetograms of a region of quiet Sun.\nOf the feature deaths that remove visible magnetic flux from the photosphere,\nthe vast majority do so by a process that merely disperses the\npreviously-detected flux so that it is too small and too weak to be detected.\nThe behavior of the ensemble average of these dispersals is not consistent with\na model of simple planar diffusion, suggesting that the dispersal is\nconstrained by the evolving photospheric velocity field. We introduce the\nconcept of the partial lifetime of magnetic features, and show that the partial\nlifetime due to Cancellation of magnetic flux, 22 h, is 3 times slower than\nprevious measurements of the flux turnover time. This indicates that prior\nfeature-based estimates of the flux replacement time may be too short, in\ncontrast with the tendency for this quantity to decrease as resolution and\ninstrumentation have improved. This suggests that dispersal of flux to smaller\nscales is more important for the replacement of magnetic fields in the quiet\nSun than observed bipolar cancellation. We conclude that processes on spatial\nscales smaller than those visible to Hinode dominate the processes of flux\nemergence and cancellation, and therefore also the quantity of magnetic flux\nthat threads the photosphere.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Jul 2013 17:05:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

The spatial variation of chromatin density within\nmouse olfactory sensory neurons is determined from soft X-ray tomography\nreconstructions of five nuclei. We show that there is a division of the nuclear\nspace into regions of low-density euchromatin and high-density heterochromatin.\nVolume exclusion experienced by a diffusing protein caused by this varying\ndensity of chromatin is modeled by a repulsive potential. The value of the\npotential at a given point in space is chosen to be proportional to the density\nof chromatin at that location. The constant of proportionality, called the\nvolume exclusivity, provides a model parameter that determines the strength of\nvolume exclusion. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the mean time for a\nprotein to locate a binding site localized in euchromatin is minimized for a\nfinite, non-zero volume exclusivity. For binding sites in heterochromatin, the\nmean time is minimized when the volume exclusivity is zero (the protein\nexperiences no volume exclusion). An analytical theory is developed to explain\nthese results. The theory suggests that for binding sites in euchromatin there\nis an optimal level of volume exclusivity that balances a reduction in the\nvolume searched in finding the binding site, with the height of effective\npotential barriers the protein must cross during the search process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Jul 2013 19:13:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 Aug 2013 16:09:52 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 19 Aug 2013 23:10:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-21"}

Thus, a temporal discrepancy can arise between the resource at the\ntime the page author created a link to it and the time when a reader follows\nthe link. This is especially important in the context of social media: the ease\nof sharing links in a tweet or Facebook post allows many people to author web\ncontent, but the space constraints combined with poor awareness by authors\noften prevents sufficient context from being generated to determine the intent\nof the post. If the links are clicked as soon as they are shared, the temporal\ndistance between sharing and clicking is so small that there is little to no\ndifference in content.

In this paper we consider\nthe possibility that DDDM remains in a cosmologically long-lived excited state\nand can scatter exothermically on nuclei (ExoDDDM). We investigate the current\nstatus of ExoDDDM direct detection and find that ExoDDDM can readily explain\nthe recently announced ~3 sigma excess observed at CDMS-Si, with almost all of\nthe 90% best-fit parameter space in complete consistency with limits from other\nexperiments, including XENON10 and XENON100. In the absence of\nisospin-dependent couplings, this consistency requires light DM with mass\ntypically in the 5-15 GeV range. The hypothesis of ExoDDDM can be tested in\ndirect detection experiments through its peaked recoil spectra, reduced annual\nmodulation amplitude, and, in some cases, its novel time-dependence. We also\ndiscuss future direct detection prospects and additional indirect constraints\nfrom colliders and solar capture of ExoDDDM. As theoretical proof-of-principle,\nwe combine the features of exothermic DM models and DDDM models to construct a\ncomplete model of ExoDDDM, exhibiting all the required properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Jul 2013 20:10:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

Until recently, however, a genome-wide view of this\ntransition has been obscured by a dearth of appropriate data and the lack of\nappropriate population genomic methods to interpret such data. Here, we present\nnovel analyses detailing the origin of the selfing species, Capsella rubella,\nwhich recently split from its outcrossing sister, Capsella grandiflora. Due to\nthe recency of the split, most variation within C. rubella is found within C.\ngrandiflora. We can therefore identify genomic regions where two C. rubella\nindividuals have inherited the same or different segments of ancestral\ndiversity (i.e. founding haplotypes) present in C. rubella's founder(s). Based\non this analysis, we show that C. rubella was founded by multiple individuals\ndrawn from a diverse ancestral population closely related to extant C.\ngrandiflora, that drift and selection have rapidly homogenized most of this\nancestral variation since C. rubella's founding, and that little novel\nvariation has accumulated within this time. Despite the extensive loss of\nancestral variation, the approximately 25% of the genome for which two C.\nrubella individuals have inherited different founding haplotypes makes up\nroughly 90% of the genetic variation between them. To extend these findings, we\ndevelop a coalescent model that utilizes the inferred frequency of founding\nhaplotypes and variation within founding haplotypes to estimate that C. rubella\nwas founded by a potentially large number of individuals 50-100 kya, and has\nsubsequently experienced a 20X reduction in its effective population size. As\npopulation genomic data from an increasing number of outcrossing/selfing pairs\nare generated, analyses like this here will facilitate a fine-scaled view of\nthe evolutionary and demographic impact of the transition to\nself-fertilization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Jul 2013 22:18:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-17"}

However, they change strongly with\nnuclear mass and range from a_a~10 MeV at mass A~10 to a_a~22 MeV at A~240.\nFollowing the considerations of a Hohenberg-Kohn functional for nuclear\nsystems, we determine how to find in practice the symmetry coefficient using\nneutron and proton densities, even when those densities are simultaneously\naffected by significant symmetry-energy and Coulomb effects. These results\nfacilitate extracting the symmetry coefficients from Skyrme-Hartree-Fock (SHF)\ncalculations, that we carry out using a variety of Skyrme parametrizations in\nthe literature. For the parametrizations, we catalog novel short-wavelength\ninstabilities. In comparing the SHF and IAS results for the symmetry\ncoefficients, we arrive at narrow (+-2.4 MeV) constraints on the symmetry\nenergy values S(rho) at 0.04<rho<0.13 fm^-3. Towards normal density the\nconstraints significantly widen, but the normal value of energy a_a^V and the\nslope parameter L are found to be strongly correlated. To narrow the\nconstraints, we reach for the measurements of asymmetry skins and arrive at\na_a^V=(30.2-33.7) MeV and L=(35-70) MeV, with those values being again strongly\npositively correlated along the diagonal of their combined region. Inclusion of\nthe skin constraints allows to narrow the constraints on S(rho), at\n0.04<rho<0.13 fm^-3, down to +-1.1 MeV. Several microscopic calculations,\nincluding variational, Bruckner-Hartree-Fock and Dirac-Bruckner-Hartree-Fock,\nare consistent with our constraint region on S(rho).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Jul 2013 23:16:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-06"}

Conversely, the concept of kinetic stability overemphasizes dominant\nmechanisms that are related to kinetic factors. This article explores the\nstability condition of protein structures from the viewpoint of meso-science,\npaying attention to the compromise in the competition between minimum free\nenergy and other dominant mechanisms. Based on our study of complex systems, we\npropose that protein folding is a meso-scale, dissipative, nonlinear and\nnon-equilibrium process that is dominated by the compromise between free energy\nand other dominant mechanisms such as environmental factors.

The\nproposed scheme increases the amount of cancellable selfinterference power by\nsuppressing the effect of both transmitter and receiver oscillator phase noise.\nThe proposed scheme consists of two main phases, an estimation phase and a\ncancellation phase. In the estimation phase, the minimum mean square error\nestimator is used to jointly estimate the transmitter and receiver phase noise\nassociated with the incoming self-interference signal. In the cancellation\nphase, the estimated phase noise is used to suppress the intercarrier\ninterference caused by the phase noise associated with the incoming\nself-interference signal.

The mixed-norm\nregularization based on the l1q norm with q>1 is attractive in many\napplications of regression and classification in that it facilitates group\nsparsity in the model. The resulting optimization problem is, however,\nchallenging to solve due to the inherent structure of the mixed-norm\nregularization. Existing work deals with special cases with q=1, 2, infinity,\nand they cannot be easily extended to the general case. In this paper, we\npropose an efficient algorithm based on the accelerated gradient method for\nsolving the general l1q-regularized problem. One key building block of the\nproposed algorithm is the l1q-regularized Euclidean projection (EP_1q). Our\ntheoretical analysis reveals the key properties of EP_1q and illustrates why\nEP_1q for the general q is significantly more challenging to solve than the\nspecial cases. Based on our theoretical analysis, we develop an efficient\nalgorithm for EP_1q by solving two zero finding problems. To further improve\nthe efficiency of solving large dimensional mixed-norm regularized problems, we\npropose a screening method which is able to quickly identify the inactive\ngroups, i.e., groups that have 0 components in the solution. This may lead to\nsubstantial reduction in the number of groups to be entered to the\noptimization. An appealing feature of our screening method is that the data set\nneeds to be scanned only once to run the screening. Compared to that of solving\nthe mixed-norm regularized problems, the computational cost of our screening\ntest is negligible. The key of the proposed screening method is an accurate\nsensitivity analysis of the dual optimal solution when the regularization\nparameter varies. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of the\nproposed algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Jul 2013 03:09:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-17"}

The intention should be allowed as many as possible\nrunning processes at all time in order to make best use of CPU.

The luminosities of the sources are typically several\nthousand L_sun while the effective temperatures are 4000-8000 K. Such stars\ncould be post-AGB stars of mass 0.4-0.8 M_sun or pre-main-sequence stars (young\nstellar objects) with masses of 7-19 M_sun. If the stars are pre-main-sequence\nstars, they are substantially cooler and younger than stars at the birth line\nwhere Galactic protostars are first supposed to become optically visible out of\ntheir molecular clouds. They should therefore be hidden in their present\nevolutionary state. The second explanation for these stars is that they are\npost-AGB or post-RGB stars that have recently undergone a binary interaction\nwhen the red giant of the binary system filled its Roche lobe.

Indeed, nuclear matter\ntraditionally addressed by mean-field models is uniform while clusters are\nknown to exist in the dilute baryonic matter which constitutes the main\ncomponent of compact objects outer shells. In the present work we investigate\nthe meaning of symmetry energy in the case of clusterized systems and the\nsensitivity of the proto-neutron star composition and equation of state to the\neffective interaction. To this aim an improved Nuclear Statistical Equilibrium\n(NSE) model is developed, where the same effective interaction is consistently\nused to determine the clusters and unbound particles energy functionals in the\nself-consistent mean-field approximation.

One of the difficulties\nis that the plasma of a stellar atmosphere can be highly inhomogeneous and\ndynamic, which implies the need to solve the non-equilibrium problem of the\ngeneration and transfer of polarized radiation in realistic three-dimensional\n(3D) stellar atmospheric models.

The numerical method of solution\nis based on the non-linear multigrid iterative method and on a novel\nshort-characteristics formal solver of the Stokes-vector transfer equation\nwhich uses monotonic B\\'ezier interpolation. Therefore, with PORTA the\ncomputing time needed to obtain at each spatial grid point the self-consistent\nvalues of the atomic density matrix (which quantifies the excitation state of\nthe atomic system) scales linearly with the total number of grid points.\nAnother crucial feature of PORTA is its parallelization strategy, which allows\nus to speed up the numerical solution of complicated 3D problems by several\norders of magnitude with respect to sequential radiative transfer approaches,\ngiven its excellent linear scaling with the number of available processors. The\nPORTA code can also be conveniently applied to solve the simpler 3D radiative\ntransfer problem of unpolarized radiation in multilevel systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Jul 2013 09:36:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Aug 2013 11:16:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

These anomalies offer the prospect of\ntesting a fundamental prediction of the cold dark matter (CDM) cosmological\nmodel: the existence of numerous substructures that are too small to host\nvisible galaxies. In two previous studies we found that the number of subhalos\nin the six high-resolution simulations of CDM galactic halos of the Aquarius\nproject is not sufficient to account for the observed frequency of flux ratio\nanomalies seen in selected quasars from the CLASS survey. These studies were\nlimited by the small number of halos used, their narrow range of masses (1-2E12\nsolar masses) and the small range of lens ellipticities considered. We address\nthese shortcomings by investigating the lensing properties of a large sample of\nhalos with a wide range of masses in two sets of high resolution simulations of\ncosmological volumes and comparing them to a currently best available sample of\nradio quasars. We find that, as expected, substructures do not change the\nflux-ratio probability distribution of image pairs and triples with large\nseparations, but they have a significant effect on the distribution at small\nseparations. For such systems, CDM substructures can account for a substantial\nfraction of the observed flux-ratio anomalies.

As such, it correlates strongly with observables\nin finite nuclei that depend on neutron-to-proton imbalance and the nuclear\nsymmetry energy that characterizes the equation of state of neutron-rich\nmatter. A rich worldwide experimental program involving studies with rare\nisotopes, parity violating electron scattering, and astronomical observations\nis devoted to pinning down the isovector sector of nuclear models. Purpose: We\nassess the theoretical systematic and statistical uncertainties of neutron-skin\nthickness and relate them to the equation of state of nuclear matter, and in\nparticular to nuclear symmetry energy parameters. Methods: We use the nuclear\nsuperfluid Density Functional Theory with several Skyrme energy density\nfunctionals and density dependent pairing. To evaluate statistical errors and\ntheir budget, we employ the statistical covariance technique. Results: We find\nthat the errors on neutron skin increase with neutron excess. Statistical\nerrors due to uncertain coupling constants of the density functional are found\nto be larger than systematic errors, the latter not exceeding 0.06 fm in most\nneutron-rich nuclei across the nuclear landscape. The single major source of\nuncertainty is the poorly determined slope L of the symmetry energy that\nparametrizes its density dependence. Conclusions: To provide essential\nconstraints on the symmetry energy of the nuclear energy density functional,\nnext-generation measurements of neutron skins are required to deliver precision\nbetter than 0.06 fm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Jul 2013 09:45:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

These studies typically explain tendency to cooperation\nby dividing people in proself and prosocial types, or appealing to forms of\nexternal control or, in iterated social dilemmas, to long-term strategies.\n  But recent experiments have shown that cooperation is possible even in\none-shot social dilemmas without forms of external control and the rate of\ncooperation typically depends on the payoffs. This makes impossible a\npredictive division between proself and prosocial people and proves that people\nhave attitude to cooperation by nature.\n  The key innovation of this article is in fact to postulate that humans have\nattitude to cooperation by nature and consequently they do not act a priori as\nsingle agents, as assumed by standard economic models, but they forecast how a\nsocial dilemma would evolve if they formed coalitions and then they act\naccording to their most optimistic forecast.

Although, all GRBs observed so far are extragalactic in origin,\nthere is a high probability of a GRB of galactic origin beaming towards the\nEarth in the past ~ 0.5 Gyr. Such an intense burst of gamma rays would ionize\nthe atmosphere and deplete the ozone layer. With depleted ozone, there will be\nan increased flux of solar UVB on the Earth's surface with harmful biological\neffects. In addition to the atmospheric damage, secondary particles produced by\ngamma ray-induced showers will reach the surface. Amongst all secondary\nparticles, muons dominate the ground-level secondary particle flux (99% of the\ntotal number of particles) and are potentially of biological significance.\nUsing the Monte Carlo simulation code CORSIKA, we modeled the air showers\nproduced by gamma ray primaries up to 100 GeV. We found that the number of\nmuons produced by hypothetical galactic GRBs significantly increases the total\nmuon flux. However, since the muon production efficiency is extremely low for\nphoton energy below 100 GeV, and because GRBs radiate strongly for only a very\nshort time, we find that the biological radiation dose from secondary muons is\nnegligible. The main mechanism of biological damage from GRBs is through solar\nUVB irradiation from the loss of ozone in the upper atmosphere.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Jul 2013 12:07:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 Aug 2013 05:35:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 17 Sep 2013 19:19:36 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 17 Dec 2013 04:16:22 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 5 Mar 2014 03:47:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-06"}

Given a set of weighted polygons in the\n2-dimensional plane, the goal is to find a set of pairwise non-overlapping\npolygons with maximum total weight. Due to its wide range of applications, the\nMWISP problem and its special cases have been extensively studied both in the\napproximation algorithms and the computational geometry community. Despite a\nlot of research, its general case is not well-understood. Currently the best\nknown polynomial time algorithm achieves an approximation ratio of n^(epsilon)\n[Fox and Pach, SODA 2011], and it is not even clear whether the problem is\nAPX-hard. We present a (1+epsilon)-approximation algorithm, assuming that each\npolygon in the input has at most a polylogarithmic number of vertices. Our\nalgorithm has quasi-polynomial running time.\n  We use a recently introduced framework for approximating maximum weight\nindependent set in geometric intersection graphs. The framework has been used\nto construct a QPTAS in the much simpler case of axis-parallel rectangles. We\nextend it in two ways, to adapt it to our much more general setting. First, we\nshow that its technical core can be reduced to the case when all input polygons\nare triangles. Secondly, we replace its key technical ingredient which is a\nmethod to partition the plane using only few edges such that the objects\nstemming from the optimal solution are evenly distributed among the resulting\nfaces and each object is intersected only a few times. Our new procedure for\nthis task is not more complex than the original one, and it can handle the\narising difficulties due to the arbitrary angles of the polygons.

The goal is to find an optimal investment in edge\ncapacities so as to minimize the sum of the routing cost of the induced Wardrop\nequilibrium and the investment cost. While this problem is considered as\nchallenging in the literature, its complexity status was still unknown. We\nclose this gap showing that CNDP is strongly NP-complete and APX-hard, both on\ndirected and undirected networks and even for instances with affine latencies.\n  As for the approximation of the problem, we first provide a detailed analysis\nfor a heuristic studied by Marcotte for the special case of monomial latency\nfunctions (Mathematical Programming, Vol.~34, 1986).

As our final\n-- and arguably most interesting -- result regarding approximation, we show\nthat using the better of the two approximation algorithms results in a strictly\nimproved approximation guarantee for which we give a closed form expression.\nFor affine latencies, e.g., this algorithm achieves a 1.195-approximation which\nimproves on the 5/4 that has been shown before by Marcotte.

While\nthere has been quite a lot of systems work in this area, especially in the\ncontext of modular self-reconfigurable robotic systems, only very little\ntheoretical work has been done in this area so far. We attempt to bridge this\ngap by proposing a model inspired by the behavior of ameba that allows rigorous\nalgorithmic research on self-organizing particle systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Jul 2013 12:41:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-17"}

Our\ngoal is to investigate their evolution and their propensity to grow planets. We\nuse an improved version of the SPH code VINE modified to better account for\nmomentum and energy conservation. The energy equation includes a flux--limited\nradiative transfer algorithm and the disk cooling is obtained via \"boundary\nparticles\". We model a system made of star/disk + star/disk where the secondary\nstar (and relative disk) is less massive than the primary. The numerical\nsimulations performed for different values of binary separation and disk\ndensity show that the disk morphology is substantially affected by the\ncompanion perturbations. Trailing spiral shock waves develop when the stars\napproach their pericenter. Strong hydraulic jumps occur at the shock front\ncreating breaking waves and a consistent mass stream between the two disks,\nsignificantly heating them. The high gas temperature may prevent the ice\ncondensation by moving outward the \"snow line\". The hydraulic jumps may slow\ndown or even halt the dust coagulation process. At apocenter these\nperturbations are reduced and the disks are cooled down and less eccentric. The\nstrength of the hydraulic jumps, disk heating, and mass exchange depends on the\nbinary separation, and for larger semi-major axes, the tidal spiral pattern is\nsubstantially reduced.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Jul 2013 14:20:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

The algorithm is based on a simple technique that reduces the\nTRP to what we call the \\emph{segmented TSP}. Here, we are given numbers\n$l_1,\\dots,l_K$ and $n_1,\\dots,n_K$ and we need to find a path that visits at\nleast $n_h$ points within path distance $l_h$ from the starting point for all\n$h\\in\\{1,\\dots,K\\}$. A solution is $\\alpha$-approximate if at least $n_h$\npoints are visited within distance $\\alpha l_h$. It is shown that any algorithm\nthat is $\\alpha$-approximate for \\emph{every constant} $K$ in some metric\nspace, gives an $\\alpha(1+\\epsilon)$-approximation for the TRP in the same\nmetric space. Subsequently, approximation schemes are given for this segmented\nTSP problem in the plane and on weighted trees. The segmented TSP with only one\nsegment ($K=1$) is equivalent to the $k$-TSP for which a\n$(2+\\epsilon)$-approximation is known for a general metric space. Hence, this\napproach through the segmented TSP gives new impulse for improving on the\n3.59-approximation for TRP in a general metric space. A similar reduction\napplies to many other minimum latency problems.

In bacterial genomes, we thus identify\nsynteny units, or \"syntons\", which are clusters of proximal genes that\nencompass and extend operons. The size distribution of these syntons divide\nthem into large syntons, which correspond to fundamental macro-molecular\ncomplexes of bacteria, and smaller ones, which display a remarkable exponential\ndistribution of sizes. This distribution is \"universal\" in two respects: it\nholds for vastly different genomes, and for functionally distinct genes.\nSimilar statistical laws have been reported previously in studies of bacterial\ngenomes, and generally attributed to purifying selection or neutral processes.\nHere, we perform a new analysis based on the concept of parsimony, and find\nthat the prevailing evolutionary mechanism behind the formation of small\nsyntons is a selective process of gene aggregation.

The\nPAndAS collaboration has identified a particularly thin configuration with\nkinematic coherence among companions of M31 and there have been long standing\nclaims that the dwarf companions to the Milky Way lie in a plane roughly\northogonal to the disk of our galaxy. This discussion investigates the possible\norigins of four Local Group planes: the plane similar, but not identical to\nthat identified by PAndAS, an adjacent slightly tilted plane, and two planes\nnear the Milky Way: one with nearer galaxies and the other with more distant\nones. Plausible orbits are found by using a combination of Numerical Action\nmethods and a backward in time integration procedure. For M31, M33, IC10, and\nLeoI, solutions are found that are consistent with measurements of their proper\nmotions. For galaxies in planes, there must be commonalities in their proper\nmotions, and this constraint greatly limits the number of physically plausible\nsolutions. Key to the formation of the planar structures has been the\nevacuation of the Local Void and consequent build-up of the Local Sheet, a wall\nof this void. Most of the M31 companion galaxies were born in early-forming\nfilamentary or sheet-like substrata that chased M31 out of the void. M31 is a\nmoving target because of its attraction toward the Milky Way, and the result\nhas been alignments stretched toward our galaxy. In the case of the\nconfiguration around the Milky Way, it appears that our galaxy was in a\nthree-way competition for companions with M31 and Centaurus A. Only those\nwithin a modest band fell our way. The Milky Ways' attraction toward the Virgo\nCluster resulted in alignments along the Milky Way-Virgo Cluster line.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Jul 2013 15:03:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Sep 2013 17:25:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

We will outline other recent developments\nin the TE wave method including VORPAL simulations of microwave resonances, as\nwell as the simulation of transmission in the presence of both an electron\ncloud and magnetic fields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Jul 2013 15:56:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-17"}

In the particular case of an extended object, the\nfactor 1/gamma of Lorentz contraction of its length in the direction of motion\nis written as a function of the velocity of the extended object. The same\nhappens with the Lorentz factor gamma of time interval dilation of a moving\nclock. In this paper we show that when gamma is written as a function of the\nrelativistic energy of the considered object the resulting expressions for the\nlength and for the time interval suggest that the contraction of length as well\nas the dilation of the time interval are manifestations of the wave behavior of\nmatter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Jul 2013 19:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-25"}
