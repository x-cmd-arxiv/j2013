Many researchers utilise ground truth (GT) in experiments\nand more often than not this GT is derived from one annotator's opinion. How\ndoes the difference in opinion affect an algorithm's evaluation? Four examples\nof typical CV problems are chosen, and a methodology is applied to each to\nquantify the inter-annotator variance and to offer insight into the mechanisms\nbehind agreement and the use of GT. It is found that when detecting linear\nobjects annotator agreement is very low. The agreement in object position,\nlinear or otherwise, can be partially explained through basic image properties.\nAutomatic object detectors are compared to annotator agreement and it is found\nthat a clear relationship exists. Several methods for calculating GTs from a\nnumber of annotations are applied and the resulting differences in the\nperformance of the object detectors are quantified. It is found that the rank\nof a detector is highly dependent upon the method used to form the GT. It is\nalso found that although the STAPLE and LSML GT estimation methods appear to\nrepresent the mean of the performance measured using the individual\nannotations, when there are few annotations, or there is a large variance in\nthem, these estimates tend to degrade. Furthermore, one of the most commonly\nadopted annotation combination methods--consensus voting--accentuates more\nobvious features, which results in an overestimation of the algorithm's\nperformance. Finally, it is concluded that in some datasets it may not be\npossible to state with any confidence that one algorithm outperforms another\nwhen evaluating upon one GT and a method for calculating confidence bounds is\ndiscussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Jul 2013 16:16:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 26 Oct 2013 14:39:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 26 Apr 2016 11:05:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-26"}

The\nshort answer to this is: No, they are not failing. Energy-based power markets\nare, however, facing several market distortions, namely from the gap between\nthe electricity volume traded at day-ahead markets versus the overall\nelectricity consumption as well as the (wrong) regulatory assumption that\nvariable RES generation, i.e., wind and photovoltaic (PV), truly have zero\nmarginal operation costs. In this paper we show that both effects over-amplify\nthe well-known merit-order effect of RES power feed-in beyond a level that is\nexplainable by underlying physical realities, i.e., thermal power plants being\nwilling to accept negative electricity prices to be able to stay online due to\nconsiderations of wear & tear and start-stop constraints.

In the context of the constrained MSSM (CMSSM) and its extension with\nnon-universal masses for the MSSM Higgs doublets (NUHM2), sparticles with\nmasses $ > 1$ TeV are necessary to reproduce the observed Higgs boson mass of\n125-126 GeV. On the other hand, there appears to be a significant amount of\ndiscrepancy between the measured muon $g-2$ and the Standard Model prediction.\nA successful explanation of this discrepancy in the MSSM requires new\ncontributions involving relatively light sparticles with masses $ < 1$ TeV. In\nthis paper, we attempt to accommodate the two conflicting requirements in an\nSU(5) inspired extension of the CMSSM. We assign non-universal but flavor blind\nsoft supersymmetry breaking masses to the scalar components in $\\bar 5$ and 10\nmatter supermultiplets. The two MSSM Higgs doublets in the 5, $\\bar5$\nrepresentations of SU(5) are also assigned unequal soft mass$^2$ at $M_{GUT}$.\nWe identify parameter regions which can simultaneously accommodate the observed\nHiggs boson mass and the muon $g-2$ data, and which are compatible with other\nphenomenological constraints such as neutralino dark matter relic abundance and\nrare B-meson decays. Some regions of the allowed parameter space will be\nexplored at the upgraded LHC and by dark matter direct detection experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Jul 2013 18:17:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-23"}

Popular analysis techniques such as clustering and\ninfluential node analysis, require the computation of eigenvectors of the real\ngraph's adjacency matrix. Recent de-anonymization attacks on Netflix and AOL\ndatasets show that an open access to such graphs pose privacy threats. Among\nthe various privacy preserving models, Differential privacy provides the\nstrongest privacy guarantees.\n  In this paper we propose a privacy preserving mechanism for publishing social\nnetwork graph data, which satisfies differential privacy guarantees by\nutilizing a combination of theory of random matrix and that of differential\nprivacy. The key idea is to project each row of an adjacency matrix to a low\ndimensional space using the random projection approach and then perturb the\nprojected matrix with random noise. We show that as compared to existing\napproaches for differential private approximation of eigenvectors, our approach\nis computationally efficient, preserves the utility and satisfies differential\nprivacy. We evaluate our approach on social network graphs of Facebook, Live\nJournal and Pokec. The results show that even for high values of noise variance\nsigma=1 the clustering quality given by normalized mutual information gain is\nas low as 0.74. For influential node discovery, the propose approach is able to\ncorrectly recover 80 of the most influential nodes. We also compare our results\nwith an approach presented in [43], which directly perturbs the eigenvector of\nthe original data by a Laplacian noise. The results show that this approach\nrequires a large random perturbation in order to preserve the differential\nprivacy, which leads to a poor estimation of eigenvectors for large social\nnetworks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Jul 2013 18:46:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-02"}

Here we study a highly\nunconventional formulation of this model, which belongs to the class of\ntopological lattice actions: it does not have any couplings at all, but just a\nconstraint for the relative angles between nearest neighbour spins. By means of\ndynamical boundary conditions we measure the helicity modulus Upsilon, which\nshows that this formulation performs a BKT phase transition as well. Its finite\nsize effects are amazingly mild, in contrast to other lattice actions. This\nprovides one of the most precise numerical confirmations ever of a BKT\ntransition in this model. On the other hand, up to the lattice sizes that we\nexplored, there are deviations from the spin wave approximation, for instance\nfor the Binder cumulant U_4 and for the leading finite size correction to\nUpsilon.

The persistence of\nrandomness in the zero noise limit is of the very same nature as in the\npioneering works by Veretennikov (Mat. Zametki, 1983) and Bafico and Baldi\n(Stochastics, 1981) concerning the so-called Peano phenomenon. In the case of\nrank-based processes, we use a simple convexity argument to prove that the\nsmall noise limit is described by the sticky particle dynamics introduced by\nBrenier and Grenier (SIAM J. Numer. Anal., 1998), where particles travel at\nconstant velocity between collisions, at which they stick together. In the\ngeneral case of order-based processes, we give a sufficient condition on the\ndrift for all the particles to aggregate into a single cluster, and compute the\nvelocity of this cluster. Our argument consists in turning the study of the\nsmall noise limit into the study of the long time behaviour of a suitably\nrescaled process, and then exhibiting a Lyapunov functional for this rescaled\nprocess.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Jul 2013 19:15:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 Dec 2013 10:33:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 10 Mar 2014 18:55:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-11"}

As of late, it has\ngarnered a lot of interest because experiments with ultracold atomic gases in\noptical lattices could be used as a simulator for phenomena of magnetic\nsystems. A paradigmatic example is the time evolution of a domain-wall state of\na spin-1/2 Heisenberg chain, the so-called domain-wall melting. The model can\nbe implemented by having two species of bosonic atoms with unity filling and\nstrong on-site repulsion U in an optical lattice. In this paper, we study the\ndomain-wall melting in such a setup on the basis of the time-dependent density\nmatrix renormalization group (tDMRG). We are particularly interested in the\neffects of defects that originate from an imperfect preparation of the initial\nstate. Typical defects are holes (empty sites) and flipped spins. We show that\nthe dominating effects of holes on observables like the spatially resolved\nmagnetization can be taken account of by a linear combination of spatially\nshifted observables from the clean case. For sufficiently large U, further\neffects due to holes become negligible. In contrast, the effects of spin flips\nare more severe as their dynamics occur on the same time scale as that of the\ndomain-wall melting itself. It is hence advisable to avoid preparation schemes\nthat are based on spin-flips.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Jul 2013 20:02:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Nov 2014 19:10:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-14"}

Searching for terrestrial planets in the HZ of\nnearby stars is the stated goal of ongoing and planned extrasolar planet\nsurveys. Previous estimates of the inner edge of the HZ were based on\none-dimensional radiative-convective models. The most serious limitation of\nthese models is the inability to predict cloud behavior. Here we use global\nclimate models with sophisticated cloud schemes to show that due to a\nstabilizing cloud feedback, tidally locked planets can be habitable at twice\nthe stellar flux found by previous studies. This dramatically expands the HZ\nand roughly doubles the frequency of habitable planets orbiting red dwarf\nstars. At high stellar flux, strong convection produces thick water clouds near\nthe substellar location that greatly increase the planetary albedo and reduce\nsurface temperatures. Higher insolation produces stronger substellar convection\nand therefore higher albedo, making this phenomenon a stabilizing climate\nfeedback. Substellar clouds also effectively block outgoing radiation from the\nsurface, reducing or even completely reversing the thermal emission contrast\nbetween dayside and nightside. The presence of substellar water clouds and the\nresulting clement surface conditions will therefore be detectable with the\nJames Webb Space Telescope.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Jul 2013 20:07:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-03"}

There is\nevidence of correlation but not a measurable lag between the optical and\ngamma-ray flaring emission.

Protein folding is a case in point. We show that the\naction principle can be applied directly to study the stability of biological\nprocesses. The action principle in classical physics starts with the first\nvariation of the action and leads immediately to the equations of motion. The\nsecond variation of the action leads in a natural way to powerful theorems that\nprovide quantitative treatment of stability and focusing and also explain how\nsome very complex processes can behave as though some seemingly important\nforces drop out. We first apply these ideas to the non-equilibrium states\ninvolved in two-state folding. We treat torsional waves and use the action\nprinciple to talk about critical points in the dynamics. For some proteins the\ntheory resembles TST. We reach several quantitative and qualitative\nconclusions. Besides giving an explanation of why TST often works in folding,\nwe find that the apparent smoothness of the energy funnel is a natural\nconsequence of the putative critical points in the dynamics. These ideas also\nexplain why biological proteins fold to unique states and random polymers do\nnot. The insensitivity to perturbations which follows from the presence of\ncritical points explains how folding to a unique shape occurs in the presence\nof dilute denaturing agents in spite of the fact that those agents disrupt the\nfolded structure of the native state. This paper contributes to the theoretical\narmamentarium by directing attention to the logical progression from first\nphysical principles to the stability theorems related to catastrophe theory as\napplied to folding.

Spectra have been obtained with VIMOS\non the ESO-VLT, integrating 0.75h, 4.5h and 18h for the Wide, Deep, and\nUltra-Deep nested surveys. A total of 1263 galaxies have been re-observed\nindependently within the VVDS, and from the VIPERS and MASSIV surveys. They are\nused to establish the redshift measurements reliability, to assess\ncompleteness, and to provide a weighting scheme taking into account the survey\nselection function. We describe the main properties of the VVDS samples, and\nthe VVDS is compared to other spectroscopic surveys. In total we have obtained\nspectroscopic redshifts for 34594 galaxies, 422 type-I AGN, and 12430 Galactic\nstars. The survey has enabled to identify galaxies up to very high redshifts\nwith 4669 redshifts in 1<=z_{spec}<=2, 561 in 2<=z_{spec}<=3 and 468 with\nz_{spec}>3, and specific populations like LAE have been identified out to\nz=6.62. We show that the VVDS occupies a unique place in the parameter space\ndefined by area, depth, redshift coverage, and number of spectra. The VVDS\nprovides a comprehensive survey of the distant universe, covering all epochs\nsince z, or more than 12 Gyr of cosmic time, with a uniform selection, the\nlargest such sample to date. A wealth of science results derived from the VVDS\nhave shed new light on the evolution of galaxies and AGN, and their\ndistribution in space, over this large cosmic time.

The diffuse thermal emission had been consistently reported in all\nprevious studies of this region, but its physical nature and relation to the\nradio lobe had not been examined in detail. Using the data set covering the\nentire western lobe and the central galaxy NGC 1316, as well as comparison sets\nin the vicinity, we find convincingly the presence of thermal plasma emission\nwith a temperature of ~1 keV in excess of conceivable background and\ncontaminating emission (cosmic X-ray background, Galactic halo, intra-cluster\ngas of Fornax, interstellar gas of NGC 1316, and the ensemble of point-like\nsources). Its surface brightness is consistent with having a spherical\ndistribution peaking at the center of the western lobe with a projected radius\nof ~12 arcmin. If the volume filling factor of the thermal gas is assumed to be\nunity, its estimated total mass amounts to ~10^{10} M_sun, which would be\n~10^{2} times that of the central black hole and comparable to that of the\ncurrent gas mass of the host galaxy. Its energy density is comparable to or\nlarger than those in the magnetic field and non-thermal electrons responsible\nfor the observed radio and X-ray emission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Jul 2013 21:52:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

Many combinatorial structures that arise in mathematics\nand computer science can be represented naturally as graph homomorphisms and as\nweighted sums of graph homomorphisms. In this paper, we study the complexity of\ncounting homomorphisms modulo 2. The complexity of modular counting was\nintroduced by Papadimitriou and Zachos and it has been pioneered by Valiant who\nfamously introduced a problem for which counting modulo 7 is easy but counting\nmodulo 2 is intractable. Modular counting provides a rich setting in which to\nstudy the structure of homomorphism problems. In this case, the structure of\nthe graph H has a big influence on the complexity of the problem. Thus, our\napproach is graph-theoretic. We give a complete solution for the class of\ncactus graphs, which are connected graphs in which every edge belongs to at\nmost one cycle. Cactus graphs arise in many applications such as the modelling\nof wireless sensor networks and the comparison of genomes. We show that, for\nsome cactus graphs H, counting homomorphisms to H modulo 2 can be done in\npolynomial time. For every other fixed cactus graph H, the problem is complete\nfor the complexity class parity-P which is a wide complexity class to which\nevery problem in the polynomial hierarchy can be reduced (using randomised\nreductions). Determining which H lead to tractable problems can be done in\npolynomial time.

Mkn 421 was observed by INTEGRAL and Fermi-LAT in an active state on\n16-21 April 2013. Well sampled optical, soft, and hard X-ray light curves show\nthe presence of two flares. The average flux in the 20-100 keV range is 9.1e-11\nerg/s/cm2 (~4.5 mCrab) and the nuclear average apparent magnitude, corrected\nfor Galactic extinction, is V ~12.2. In the time-resolved X-ray spectra (3.5-60\nkeV), which are described by broken power laws and, marginally better, by\nlog-parabolic laws, we see a hardening that correlates with flux increase, as\nexpected in refreshed energy injections in a population of electrons that later\ncool via synchrotron radiation. The hardness ratios between the JEM-X fluxes in\ntwo different bands and between the JEM-X and IBIS/ISGRI fluxes confirm this\ntrend.

We compare results obtained with the Bruzual &\nCharlot models, a preliminary update of them, and a combination of spectra\nderived from the Granada and MILES models. About 100k CALIFA spectra are used\nin this comparison.\n  Noise and shape-related errors at the level expected for CALIFA propagate to\n0.10-0.15 dex uncertainties in stellar masses, mean ages and metallicities.\nUncertainties in A_V increase from 0.06 mag in the case of random noise to 0.16\nmag for shape errors. Higher order products such as SFHs are more uncertain,\nbut still relatively stable. Due to the large number statistics of datacubes,\nspatial averaging reduces uncertainties while preserving information on the\nhistory and structure of stellar populations. Radial profiles of global\nproperties, as well as SFHs averaged over different regions are much more\nstable than for individual spaxels. Uncertainties related to the choice of base\nmodels are larger than those associated with data and method. Differences in\nmean age, mass and metallicity are ~ 0.15 to 0.25 dex, and 0.1 mag in A_V.\nSpectral residuals are ~ 1% on average, but with systematic features of up to\n4%. The origin of these features is discussed. (Abridged)\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Jul 2013 23:53:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

It shows the factor $c$ is almost unity within the range\n0$< \\delta \\leq$0.002, which supports the previous conclusion. However, it\ndemonstrates that $\\delta$ cannot take a negative value from the normalization\npoint of view. As a result, a stronger constraint on $\\delta$ is defined as\n0$\\leq \\delta \\leq$0.002. The astrophysical implication on the solar neutrino\nfluxes is simply discussed based on a positive $\\delta$ value of 0.003. The\nreduction of the $^7$Be and $^8$B neutrino fluxes expected from the modified\n\\textsf{MBD} can possibly shed alternative light on the solar neutrino problem.\nIn addition, the resonant reaction rates for the $^{14}$N($p$,$\\gamma$)$^{15}$O\nreaction are calculated with a standard \\textsf{MBD} and a modified\n\\textsf{MBD}, respectively.

In addition, heat can be pumped into the hot source by driving\na charge current in the coupled conductor. An optimal configuration is found\nfor structures in which the energy dependence of tunneling maximizes asymmetric\ntransmission with maximal charge-heat cross-correlations. Remarkably, at a\nvoltage that stalls the heat engine we find that in the optimal case the\nnon-equilibrium state is maintained by fluctuations in the heat and charge\ncurrent only.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Jul 2013 06:47:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 9 Dec 2013 13:27:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-10"}

The DLAs and sub-DLAs are\nbelieved to contain a large fraction of neutral gas mass in the Universe. In\nPaper I of the series, we present the results of a search for DLAs and sub-DLAs\nin the ESO-UVES Advanced Data Products dataset of 250 quasars. Here we use an\nunbiased sub-sample of sub-DLAs from this dataset. We build a subset of 122\nquasars ranging from 1.5 <z_em < 5.0, suitable for statistical analysis. The\nstatistical sample is analyzed in conjunction with other sub-DLA samples from\nthe literature. This makes up a combined sample of 89 sub-DLAs over a redshift\npath of $\\Delta z=193$. Redshift evolution of the number density and the line\ndensity are derived for sub-DLAs and compared with the LLSs and DLAs\nmeasurements from the literature. The results indicate that these three classes\nof absorbers are evolving in the redshift interval 1 < z < 5. The column\ndensity distribution, f(N,z), down to the sub-DLA limit is determined. The\nflattening of f_(N,z) in the sub-DLA regime is present in the observations. The\nredshift evolution of f_(N,z) down to sub-DLA regime is also presented,\nindicating the presence of more sub-DLAs at high-redshift as compared to\nlow-redshift. f_(N,z) is further used to determine the neutral gas mass\ndensity, Omega_g, at 1.5 < z < 5.0. The complete sample shows that sub-DLAs\ncontribute 8-20% to the total Omega_g from 1.5 < z < 5.0. In agreement with\nprevious studies, no evolution of Omega_g is seen from low-redshift to\nhigh-redshift, suggesting that star formation solely cannot explain this\nnon-evolution and replenishment of gas and/or recombination of ionized gas is\nneeded.

Many high resolution experimental observations show enormous\nintratumor heterogeneity at molecular, genetic and cellular levels which is\nmade responsible for emerging resistance to therapy. Therefore, researchers\nsearch techniques to influence development of intratumor heterogeneity, which\nrequires understanding its role within the context of integrative, logically\nconsistent, framework, such as evolutionary theory. Although it is agreed that\nintratumor heterogeneity increases probability of the emergence of therapy\nresistant clones, more instructive role of its structure in the process of\ncancer dynamics and metastasis is needed. In the paper, intratumor\nheterogeneity is viewed as a product of two, in general stochastic, processes,\nevolutionary optimization and changing environment, respectively. In\nevolutionary theory, common risk-diversifying strategy displayed by isogenic\npopulations in unpredictably changing environments is bet-hedging. We suggest,\nthat the structure of intratumor heterogeneity is evolutionary trait evolving\nto maximize the clonal fitness in changing (or uncertain) environment and that\nits structure corresponds to bet-hedging strategy.

These states are\nseparated by first-order phase transitions between them. In both gas and liquid\nphases the complete translational and rotational symmetry exist, whereas in a\nsolid phase both symmetries are broken. In intermediate phases between liquid\nand solid, which include liquid crystal and plastic crystal phases, only one of\nthe two symmetries is preserved. Among the fundamental states of matter, the\nliquid state is most poorly understood. We argue that it is crucial for a\nbetter understanding of liquid to recognize that a liquid generally has a\ntendency to have local structural order and its presence is intrinsic and\nuniversal to any liquid. Such structural ordering is a consequence of many body\ncorrelations, more specifically, bond angle correlations, which we believe are\ncrucial for the description of the liquid state. We show that this physical\npicture may naturally explain difficult unsolved problems associated with the\nliquid state, such as anomalies of water-type liquids (water, Si, Ge, ...),\nliquid-liquid transition, liquid-glass transition, crystallization and\nquasicrystal formation, in a unified manner. In other words, we need a new\norder parameter representing low local free-energy configuration, which is bond\norientational order parameter in many cases, in addition to density order\nparameter for the physical description of these phenomena. Here we review our\ntwo-order-parameter model of liquid and consider how transient local structural\nordering is linked to all of the above-mentioned phenomena.

Dark\nradiation, a weakly interacting component of radiation, is one of the important\ningredients in our cosmological model which is testable by Planck and other\nobservational probes. At the moment the possible existence of dark radiation is\nan unsolved question. For instance, the discrepancy between the value of the\nHubble constant, H_0, inferred from the Planck data and local measurements of\nH_0 can to some extent be alleviated by enlarging the minimal LambdaCDM model\nto include additional relativistic degrees of freedom. From a fundamental\nphysics point of view dark radiation is no less interesting. Indeed, it could\nwell be one of the most accessible windows to physics beyond the standard\nmodel. An example of this is that sterile neutrinos, hinted at in terrestrial\noscillation experiments, might also be a source of dark radiation, and\ncosmological observations can therefore be used to test specific particle\nphysics models. Here we review the most recent cosmological results including a\ncomplete investigation of the dark radiation sector in order to provide an\noverview of models that are still compatible with new cosmological\nobservations. Furthermore we update the cosmological constraints on neutrino\nphysics and dark radiation properties focussing on tensions between data sets\nand degeneracies among parameters that can degrade our information or mimic the\nexistence of extra species.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Jul 2013 09:16:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-03"}

After that, the secret\nmessage is hidden inside the 5X5 window as a non-multiples of 5. Since the\nmodulus of non-multiples of 5 are 1,2,3 and 4, therefore; if the reminder is\none of these, then this pixel represents a secret character. The secret key\nthat has to be sent is the window size. The main advantage of this novel\nalgorithm is to keep the size of the cover image constant while the secret\nmessage increased in size. Peak signal-to-noise ratio is captured for each of\nthe images tested. Based on the PSNR value of each images, the stego image has\nhigh PSNR value.

Such measurements can be hindered by the presence\nof extraneous noise sources, the most prominent of which is the coupling of\nfluctuations along different spatial directions, which may affect any optical\ntweezers setup. In this paper we analyze, both from the theoretical and the\nexperimental points of view, the most common source for these couplings in Dual\nTrap Optical Tweezers setups: the misalignment of traps and tether. We give\ncriteria to distinguish different kinds of misalignment, to estimate their\nquantitative relevance and to include them in the data analysis. The\nexperimental data is obtained in a novel dual trap optical tweezers setup which\ndirectly measures forces. In the case in which misalignment is negligible we\nprovide a method to measure the stiffness of traps and tether based on variance\nanalysis. This method can be seen as a calibration technique valid beyond the\nlinear trap region. Our analysis is then employed to measure the persistence\nlength of ds-DNA tethers of three different lengths spanning two orders of\nmagnitude. The effective persistence length of such tethers is shown to\ndecrease with the contour length, in accordance with previous studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Jul 2013 09:38:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-03"}

For distances that are small compared with the lattice constant, the\npressure indeed depends on the inverse distance as predicted by Freund.

We introduce two\nexternal fields acting on the colloidal fluid: a uniform gravitational field\n(body force), and a surface field imposed by pinning a layer of equilibrium\nparticles (rough wall). We show that crystal nucleation is suppressed in\nproximity of the wall due to the slowing down of the dynamics, and that the\nspatial range of this effect is governed by the static length scale of bond\norientational order. For distances from the wall larger than this length scale,\nthe nucleation rate is greatly enhanced by the process of sedimentation, since\nit leads to a higher volume fraction, or a higher degree of supercooling, near\nthe bottom. The nucleation stage is similar to the homogeneous case, with\nnuclei being on average spherical and having crystalline planes randomly\noriented in space.

In contrast to other X-ray transients, the\nquiescent light curves of Swift J1357.2-0933 do not show the secondary star's\nellipsoidal modulation. The optical light curve is dominated by variability\nwith an optical fractional rms of ~35 per cent, a factor of >3 larger than what\nis observed in other systems at similar time-resolution. Optical flare events\nlasting 2-10min with amplitudes of up to ~1.5 mag are seen as well as numerous\nrapid ~0.8 mag dip events which are similar to the optical dips seen in\noutburst. Similarly the infrared J-band light curve is dominated by variability\nwith a fractional rms of ~21 per cent and flare events lasting 10--30 min with\namplitudes of up to ~1.5 mag are observed. The quiescent optical to\nmid-infrared spectral energy distribution in quiescence is dominated by a\nnon-thermal component with a power--law index of -1.4, (the broad-band rms SED\nhas a similar index) which arises from optically thin synchrotron emission most\nlikely originating in a weak jet; the lack of a peak in the spectral energy\ndistribution rules out advection-dominated models. Using the outburst\namplitude--period relation for X-ray transients we estimate the quiescent\nmagnitude of the secondary star to lie in the range V_min=22.7 to 25.6, which\nwhen combined with the absolute magnitude of the expected M4.5 V secondary star\nallows us to constrain to the distance to lie in the range 0.5 to 6.3 kpc.\n(Abridged)\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Jul 2013 10:13:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

We find\nthat SPHS and AMR are in excellent agreement, with both forming a well-defined\nentropy core that rapidly converges with increasing mass and force resolution.\nBy contrast, SPH exhibits rather different behaviour. At low redshift, entropy\ndecreases systematically with decreasing cluster-centric radius, converging on\never lower central values with increasing resolution. At higher redshift, SPH\nis in better agreement with SPHS and AMR but shows much poorer numerical\nconvergence. We trace these discrepancies to artificial surface tension in SPH\nat phase boundaries. At early times, the passage of massive substructures close\nto the cluster centre stirs and shocks gas to build an entropy core. At later\ntimes, artificial surface tension causes low entropy gas to sink artificially\nto the centre of the cluster.\n  We use SPHS to study the contribution of numerical versus physical\ndissipation on the entropy core, and argue that numerical dissipation is\nrequired to ensure single-valued fluid quantities in converging flows. However,\nprovided this dissipation occurs only at the resolution limit, and provided\nthat it does not propagate errors to larger scales, its effect is benign. There\nis no requirement to build `sub-grid' models of unresolved turbulence for\ngalaxy cluster simulations. We conclude that entropy cores in non-radiative\nsimulations of galaxy clusters are physical, resulting from entropy generation\nin shocked gas during cluster assembly, putting to rest the long-standing\npuzzle of cluster entropy cores in AMR simulations versus their apparent\nabsence in classic SPH simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Jul 2013 10:28:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

Each\nparticle is described by a minimal cost resolution which consists on a single\nsmall kernel (bell-shaped function) concomitant to the particle. The main role\nof the particle kernel is to interpolate fluid properties and spread particle\nforces. Here, we extend the kernel functionality to allow for an arbitrary\nparticle compressibility. The particle-fluid force is obtained from an imposed\nno-slip constraint which enforces similar particle and kernel fluid velocities.\nThis coupling is instantaneous and permits to capture the fast, non-linear\neffects underlying the radiation forces on particles. Acoustic forces arise\neither because an excess in particle compressibility (monopolar term) or in\nmass (dipolar contribution) over the fluid values. Comparison with theoretical\nexpressions show that the present generalization of the IC method correctly\nreproduces both contributions.

Recent\nwork has emphasized the difficulty of forming these planets at their observed\nlocations. It has been suggested that these planets formed further out in their\ndiscs and migrated in to locations where they are observed. We examine the\norbital evolution of planets embedded in circumbinary disc models for the three\nsystems Kepler-16, Kepler-34 and Kepler-35. The aims are: to explore the\nplausibility of a formation scenario in which cores form at large distances\nfrom the binaries and undergo inward migration and gas accretion as the gas\ndisc disperses; to determine which sets of disc parameters lead to planets\nwhose final orbits provide reasonable fits to the observed systems. We\nperformed simulations of a close binary system interacting with circumbinary\ndiscs with differing aspect ratios, and viscous stress parameters. Once the\nbinary+disc system reaches quasi-equilibrium we embed a planet in the disc and\nexamine its evolution under the action of binary and disc forces. We consider\nfully-formed planets with masses equal to those inferred from Kepler data, and\nlow-mass cores that migrate and accrete gas while the gas disc is being\ndispersed. A typical outcome for all systems is stalling of inward migration as\nthe planet enters the inner cavity formed by the binary system. The\ncircumbinary disc becomes eccentric and the disc eccentricity forces the planet\ninto a noncircular orbit. For each of the Kepler-16b, Kepler-34b and Kepler-35b\nsystems we obtain planets whose parameters agree reasonably well with the\nobservational data. The simulations presented here provide support for a\nformation scenario in which a core forms, migrates inward and accretes gas, but\naccurate fitting of the observed Kepler systems is likely to require disc\nmodels that are significantly more sophisticated in terms of their input\nphysics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Jul 2013 14:32:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

We contrast the resonant I\n= 1/2 channel with the repulsive non-resonant I = 3/2 channel, where the phase\nis found to be negative and small, in agreement with experiment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Jul 2013 15:57:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 11 Jul 2013 14:56:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 17 Oct 2013 07:35:48 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 12 Aug 2014 06:36:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-13"}

In asexual populations, these mutations must either arise on the\nsame background or compete against each other. In sexual populations,\nrecombination can bring together beneficial alleles from different backgrounds,\nbut tightly linked alleles may still greatly interfere with each other. We show\nfor well-mixed populations that when this interference is strong, the genome\ncan be seen as consisting of many effectively asexual stretches linked\ntogether. The rate at which beneficial alleles fix is thus roughly proportional\nto the rate of recombination, and depends only logarithmically on the mutation\nsupply and the strength of selection. Our scaling arguments also allow to\npredict, with reasonable accuracy, the distribution of effects of fixed\nmutations when new mutations have broadly-distributed effects. We focus on the\nregime in which crossovers occur more frequently than beneficial mutations, as\nis likely to be the case for many natural populations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Jul 2013 15:57:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 14 Dec 2013 04:52:05 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 18 Dec 2013 05:57:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-19"}

In this survey we review major characteristics of human mobility\nstudies including from trajectory-based studies to studies using graph and\nnetwork theory. In trajectory-based studies statistical measures such as jump\nlength distribution and radius of gyration are analyzed in order to investigate\nhow people move in their daily life, and if it is possible to model this\nindividual movements and make prediction based on them. Using graph in mobility\nstudies, helps to investigate the dynamic behavior of the system, such as\ndiffusion and flow in the network and makes it easier to estimate how much one\npart of the network influences another by using metrics like centrality\nmeasures. We aim to study population flow in transportation networks using\nmobility data to derive models and patterns, and to develop new applications in\npredicting phenomena such as congestion. Human Mobility studies with the new\ngeneration of mobility data provided by cellular phone networks, arise new\nchallenges such as data storing, data representation, data analysis and\ncomputation complexity. A comparative review of different data types used in\ncurrent tools and applications of Human Mobility studies leads us to new\napproaches for dealing with mentioned challenges.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Jul 2013 08:33:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-04"}

The setup uses a counter-propagating\ngeometry, which allows momentum measurement on each beam separately. The\nexperimental advantages of this setup include low drift due to all-optical\nmanipulation, and a robust calibration (independent of the features of the\ntrapped object or buffer medium) due to the force measurement method. Although\nthis design does not attain the high-resolution of some co-propagating setups,\nwe show that it can be used to perform different single molecule measurements:\nfluctuation-based molecular stiffness characterization at different forces and\nhopping experiments on molecular hairpins. Remarkably, in our setup it is\npossible to manipulate very short tethers (such as molecular hairpins with\nshort handles) down to the limit where beads are almost in contact. The setup\nis used to illustrate a novel method for measuring the stiffness of optical\ntraps and tethers on the basis of equilibrium force fluctuations, i.e. without\nthe need of measuring the force vs molecular extension curve. This method is of\ngeneral interest for dual trap optical tweezers setups and can be extended to\nsetups which do not directly measure forces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Jul 2013 10:12:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-04"}
