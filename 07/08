In particular, a stochastic\nsubgradient mirror-descent method with weighted iterate-averaging is\ninvestigated and its per-iterate convergence rate is analyzed. The novel part\nof the approach is in the choice of weights that are used to construct the\naverages. Through the use of these weighted averages, we show that the known\noptimal rates can be obtained with simpler algorithms than those currently\nexisting in the literature. Specifically, by suitably choosing the stepsize\nvalues, one can obtain the rate of the order $1/k$ for strongly convex\nfunctions, and the rate $1/\\sqrt{k}$ for general convex functions (not\nnecessarily differentiable). Furthermore, for the latter case, it is shown that\na stochastic subgradient mirror-descent with iterate averaging converges (along\na subsequence) to an optimal solution, almost surely, even with the stepsize of\nthe form $1/\\sqrt{1+k}$, which was not previously known. The stepsize choices\nthat achieve the best rates are those proposed by Paul Tseng for acceleration\nof proximal gradient methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Jul 2013 16:02:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-09"}

Bins with different pallet labels\nhave to be placed on different pallets, bins with the same pallet label have to\nbe placed on the same pallet. After all bins for a pallet have been removed\nfrom the given sequences, the corresponding stack-up place will be cleared and\nbecomes available for a further pallet. The FIFO stack-up problem is to find a\nstack-up sequence such that all pallets can be build-up with the available p\nstack-up places. In this paper, we introduce two digraph models for the FIFO\nstack-up problem, namely the processing graph and the sequence graph. We show\nthat there is a processing of some list of sequences with at most p stack-up\nplaces if and only if the sequence graph of this list has directed pathwidth at\nmost p-1. This connection implies that the FIFO stack-up problem is NP-complete\nin general, even if there are at most 6 bins for every pallet and that the\nproblem can be solved in polynomial time, if the number p of stack-up places is\nassumed to be fixed. Further the processing graph allows us to show that the\nproblem can be solved in polynomial time, if the number k of sequences is\nassumed to be fixed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Jul 2013 21:02:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 21 Sep 2013 13:28:19 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 7 Jun 2014 11:10:25 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 20 Apr 2015 08:38:13 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 2 Oct 2015 13:16:56 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Thu, 15 Oct 2015 09:24:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-16"}

Unfortunately, most methods proposed to reduce the fluctuations in\nchaotic systems are not applicable for real, biological populations. This is\nbecause such methods typically require detailed knowledge of system specific\nparameters and the ability to manipulate them in real time; conditions often\nnot met by most real populations. Moreover, real populations are often noisy\nand extinction-prone, which can sometimes render such methods ineffective. Here\nwe investigate a control strategy, which works by perturbing the population\nsize, and is robust to reasonable amounts of noise and extinction probability.\nThis strategy, called the Adaptive Limiter Control (ALC), has been previously\nshown to increase constancy and persistence of laboratory populations and\nmetapopulations of Drosophila melanogaster. Here we present a detailed\nnumerical investigation of the effects of ALC on the fluctuations and\npersistence of metapopulations. We show that at high migration rates,\napplication of ALC does not require a priori information about the population\ngrowth rates. We also show that ALC can stabilize metapopulations even when\napplied to as low as one-tenth of the total number of subpopulations. Moreover,\nALC is effective even when the subpopulations have high extinction rates:\nconditions under which one other control algorithm has previously failed to\nattain stability. Importantly, ALC not only reduces the fluctuation in\nmetapopulation sizes, but also the global extinction probability. Finally, the\nmethod is robust to moderate levels of noise in the dynamics and the carrying\ncapacity of the environment. These results, coupled with our earlier empirical\nfindings, establish ALC to be a strong candidate for stabilizing real\nbiological metapopulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Jul 2013 21:09:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

For a stream narrow relative to its orbital radius the time of\nstream crossing is sufficiently short that the impact approximation can be used\nto derive the changes in angular momenta and radial actions along the star\nstream. The epicyclic approximation is used to calculate the evolution of the\ndensity of the stream as it orbits around in a galactic potential. Analytic\nexpressions are available for a point mass, however, the general expressions\nare easily numerically evaluated for perturbing objects with arbitrary density\nprofiles. With a simple allowance for the velocity dispersion of the stream,\nmoderately warm streams can be modeled. The predicted evolution agrees well\nwith the outcome of simulations of stellar streams for streams with widths up\nto 1% of the orbital radius of the stream. The angular momentum distribution\nwithin the stream shears out gaps with time, further reducing their visibility,\nalthough the size of the shear effect requires more detailed simulations. An\nillustrative model indicates that shear will limit the persistent gaps to a\nminimum length of a few times the stream width. In general the equations are\nuseful for dynamical insight into the development of stream gaps and their\nmeasurement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Jul 2013 23:56:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

In this respect, the $B$-test family combines favorable\nproperties of previously proposed MMD two-sample tests: B-tests are more\npowerful than a linear time test where blocks are just pairs of samples, yet\nthey are more computationally efficient than a quadratic time test where a\nsingle large block incorporating all the samples is used to compute a\nU-statistic. A further important advantage of the B-tests is their\nasymptotically Normal null distribution: this is by contrast with the\nU-statistic, which is degenerate under the null hypothesis, and for which\nestimates of the null distribution are computationally demanding.

However, the\nrelatively low bandwidth and high latency of the PCI-e bus are usually\nbottleneck issues for co-processing. Recently, coupled CPU-GPU architectures\nhave received a lot of attention, e.g. AMD APUs with the CPU and the GPU\nintegrated into a single chip. That opens up new opportunities for optimizing\nquery co-processing. In this paper, we experimentally revisit hash joins, one\nof the most important join algorithms for main memory databases, on a coupled\nCPU-GPU architecture. Particularly, we study the fine-grained co-processing\nmechanisms on hash joins with and without partitioning. The co-processing\noutlines an interesting design space. We extend existing cost models to\nautomatically guide decisions on the design space. Our experimental results on\na recent AMD APU show that (1) the coupled architecture enables fine-grained\nco-processing and cache reuses, which are inefficient on discrete CPU-GPU\narchitectures; (2) the cost model can automatically guide the design and tuning\nknobs in the design space; (3) fine-grained co-processing achieves up to 53%,\n35% and 28% performance improvement over CPU-only, GPU-only and conventional\nCPU-GPU co-processing, respectively. We believe that the insights and\nimplications from this study are initial yet important for further research on\nquery co-processing on coupled CPU-GPU architectures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Jul 2013 06:23:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-26"}

An [n, k, d] code having all-symbol (r,\n\\delta})-locality, denoted as (r, {\\delta})a, is considered optimal if it also\nmeets the minimum Hamming distance bound. The existing results on the existence\nand the construction of optimal (r, {\\delta})a codes are limited to only the\nspecial case of {\\delta} = 2, and to only two small regions within this special\ncase, namely, m = 0 or m >= (v+{\\delta}-1) > ({\\delta}-1), where m = n mod\n(r+{\\delta}-1) and v = k mod r. This paper investigates the existence\nconditions and presents deterministic constructive algorithms for optimal (r,\n{\\delta})a codes with general r and {\\delta}. First, a structure theorem is\nderived for general optimal (r, {\\delta})a codes which helps illuminate some of\ntheir structure properties. Next, the entire problem space with arbitrary n, k,\nr and {\\delta} is divided into eight different cases (regions) with regard to\nthe specific relations of these parameters. For two cases, it is rigorously\nproved that no optimal (r, {\\delta})a could exist. For four other cases the\noptimal (r, {\\delta})a codes are shown to exist, deterministic constructions\nare proposed and the lower bound on the required field size for these\nalgorithms to work is provided. Our new constructive algorithms not only cover\nmore cases, but for the same cases where previous algorithms exist, the new\nconstructions require a considerably smaller field, which translates to\npotentially lower computational complexity. Our findings substantially enriches\nthe knowledge on (r, {\\delta})a codes, leaving only two cases in which the\nexistence of optimal codes are yet to be determined.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Jul 2013 07:03:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-09"}

For $n=2$ and 3 the model\nis equivalent to the scalar and the O(3)-symmetric vector models, for $n\\ge4$\nit involves two independent interaction terms and two coupling constants. It is\nshown that for $n>4$ the RG equations have no infrared (IR) attractive fixed\npoints and their solutions (RG flows) leave the stability region of the model.\nThis means that fluctuations of the order parameter change the nature of the\nphase transition from the second-order type (suggested by the mean-field\ntheory) to the first-order one. For $n=4$, the IR attractive fixed point exists\nand the IR behaviour is non-universal: if the coupling constants belong to the\nbasin of attraction for the IR point, the phase transition is of the second\norder and the IR critical scaling regime realizes. The corresponding critical\nexponents $\\nu$ and $\\eta$ are presented in the order $\\varepsilon$ and\n$\\varepsilon^{2}$, respectively. Otherwise the RG flows pass outside the\nstability region and the first-order transition takes place.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Jul 2013 09:12:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 Sep 2013 11:11:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-01"}

At high metallicity, we find\nthat the Goldreich-Schubert-Fricke instability, active at the interface between\nthe convective envelope and the rapid rotating core, contaminates the\n13C-pocket (the major neutron source) with 14N (the major neutron poison), thus\nreducing the neutron flux available for the synthesis of heavy elements. As a\nconsequence, the yields of heavy-s elements (Ba, La, Nd, Sm) and, to a less\nextent, those of light-s elements (Sr, Y, Zr) decrease with increasing rotation\nvelocities up to 60 km/s. However, for larger initial rotation velocities, the\nproduction of light-s and, to a less extent, that of heavy-s begins again to\nincrease, due to mixing induced by meridional circulations. At low metallicity,\nthe effects of meridional circulations are important even at rather low\nrotation velocity. The combined effect of Goldreich-Schubert-Fricke instability\nand meridional circulations determines an increase of light-s and, to a less\nextent, heavy-s elements, while lead is strongly reduced. For both\nmetallicities, the rotation-induced instabilities active during the interpulse\nphase reduce the neutrons-to-seeds ratio, so that the spectroscopic indexes\n[hs/ls] and [Pb/hs] decrease by increasing the initial rotation velocity.

For example a proof may be traversed to identify\na minimal reason that led to unsatisfiability, for computing abstractions, or\nfor deriving Craig interpolants. In this paper we focus on two important\naspects that concern efficient handling of proofs of unsatisfiability:\ncompression and manipulation. First of all, since the proof size can be very\nlarge in general (exponential in the size of the input problem), it is indeed\nbeneficial to adopt techniques to compress it for further processing. Secondly,\nproofs can be manipulated as a flexible preprocessing step in preparation for\ninterpolant computation. Both these techniques are implemented in a framework\nthat makes use of local rewriting rules to transform the proofs. We show that a\ncareful use of the rules, combined with existing algorithms, can result in an\neffective simplification of the original proofs.

For stability and efficiency reasons several of the\noperational forecasting centres, in particular the Met Office and the ECMWF in\nthe UK, use semi-implicit semi-Lagrangian time stepping in the dynamical core\nof the model. The additional burden with this approach is that a three\ndimensional elliptic partial differential equation (PDE) for the pressure\ncorrection has to be solved at every model time step and this often constitutes\na significant proportion of the time spent in the dynamical core. To run within\ntight operational time scales the solver has to be parallelised and there seems\nto be a (perceived) misconception that elliptic solvers do not scale to large\nprocessor counts and hence implicit time stepping can not be used in very high\nresolution global models. After reviewing several methods for solving the\nelliptic PDE for the pressure correction and their application in atmospheric\nmodels we demonstrate the performance and very good scalability of Krylov\nsubspace solvers and multigrid algorithms for a representative model equation\nwith more than $10^{10}$ unknowns on 65536 cores on HECToR, the UK's national\nsupercomputer.

An equilibrium is optimal\nfor a player, if her payoff is maximal. A tempting approach to solving this\nproblem is to seek optimal Nash equilibria, the standard form of equilibria\nwhere no player has an incentive to deviate from her strategy. We argue that a\nplayer with the power to define an equilibrium is in a position, where she\nshould not be interested in the symmetry of a Nash equilibrium, and ignore the\nquestion of whether or not her outcome can be improved if the other strategies\nare fixed. That is, she would only have to make sure that the other players\nhave no incentive to deviate. This defines a greater class of equilibria, which\nmay have better (and cannot have worse) optimal equilibria for the designated\npowerful player. We apply this strategy to concurrent bimatrix games and to\nturn based multi-player mean-payoff games. For the latter, we show that such\npolitical equilibria as well as Nash equilibria always exist, and provide\nsimple examples where the political equilibrium is superior.

We construct the\nlargest sample to date of 58 high redshift quasars (z > 0.45) selected from the\nXMM-Newton archive based on a high photon count criterion (> 1800). We measure\nthe optical depth tau at 0.5 keV, and find that 43% of the quasars show\nsignificant absorption. We aim to find which physical parameters of the quasars\ndrive their observed absorption, e.g., redshift, radio luminosity, radio\nloudness, or the X-ray luminosity. We compare the absorption behavior with\nredshift with the pattern expected if the diffuse intergalactic medium (IGM) is\nresponsible for the observed absorption, and with a comparison sample of gamma\nray burst (GRB) X-ray afterglows. Although the z > 2 quasar opacity is\nconsistent with diffuse IGM absorption, many intermediate z (0.45 < z < 2)\nquasars are not sufficiently absorbed for this scenario, and are appreciably\nless absorbed than GRBs. Only 10/37 quasars at z < 2 are absorbed, and only\n5/30 radio quiet quasars are absorbed. We find a weak correlation between tau\nand z, and even a weaker correlation between tau and radio luminosity, which\nleads to the conclusion that although a diffuse IGM origin for the quasar\nabsorption is unlikely, optical depth does seem to increase with redshift,\nroughly as (1+z)^{2.2+-0.6}, tending at high-z to tau ~ 0.4, similar to the\nhigh-z GRB values. This result can be explained by an ionized and clumpy IGM at\nz < 2, and a cold, diffuse IGM at higher redshift. If, conversely, ascribed to\nlocal absorption at the quasar, and owing to the steep L_x ~ (1+z)^{7.1+-0.5}\ncorrelation in the present sample, the host column density scales as N_H ~\nL_x^{0.7+-0.1}.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Jul 2013 12:02:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

Since systems of this type exhibit a clear separation of\ncolloidal and solvent relaxation time scales with typical times of interfacial\ntension measurements in between, they can be expected to be suitable for\nanalogous experimental studies, too. The major finding is that, irrespective of\nhow much the bulk phases differ from two-phase coexistence, the interfacial\nstructure and the interfacial tension approach those at two-phase coexistence\nduring the early-stage relaxation process. This is a surprising observation\nsince it implies that the relaxation towards global equilibrium of the\ninterface is not following but preceding that of the bulk phases.

The optical data are combined with archival\nnear-IR data from the HST Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) G141 grism, covering the\nwavelength range 1.087-1.687 micron, with resolving power R=130. We obtain the\ntransmission spectrum from 0.53-1.687 microns with S/N levels between 3000 and\n11,000 in 0.1 micron bins.

Our measurements rule out TiO features predicted for\na planet of WASP-19b's equilibrium temperature (2050 K) in the transmission\nspectrum at the 2.7-2.9 sigma confidence level, depending on atmospheric model\nformalism. The WFC3 transmission spectrum shows strong absorption features due\nto the presence of H2O, which is detected at the 4 sigma confidence level\nbetween 1.1 and 1.4 microns. The results indicate that WASP-19b is a planet\nwith no or low levels of TiO and without a high C/O ratio. The lack of\nobservable TiO features are possibly due to rainout, breakdown from stellar\nactivity or the presence of other absorbers in the optical.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Jul 2013 13:14:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 11 Jul 2013 19:42:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

We aim\nat a consistent set of parameters for the open clusters investigated in our\nphotometric Delta-a survey of chemically peculiar stars. Special attention is\npaid to expanding our knowledge of cluster metallicities and verifying their\nscale. Making use of a previously developed method based on normalised\nevolutionary grids and photometric data, the distance, age, reddening, and\nmetallicity of open clusters were derived. To transform photometric\nmeasurements into effective temperatures to use as input for our method, a set\nof temperature calibrations for the most commonly used colour indices and\nphotometric systems was compiled. We analysed 58 open clusters in total. Our\nderived metallicity values were in excellent agreement with about 30\nspectroscopically studied targets. The mean value of the absolute deviations\nwas found to be 0.03 dex, with no noticeable offset or gradient.

No significant differences were found\ncompared to grids using the former adopted solar value Z=0.02. Furthermore,\nsome divergent photometric datasets were identified and discussed. The method\nprovides an accurate way of obtaining properly scaled metallicity values for\nopen clusters.

The model ratios are too large and the blue-optical (\\lambda =\n4000-4800\\AA) slopes are too red in both the impulsive and gradual decay phases\nof all twenty flares. This discrepancy implies that further work is needed to\nunderstand the heating at high column mass during dMe flares.

Whenever the whole structure of a network\nis unknown, one must resort to reconstruction methods that identify the least\nbiased ensemble of networks consistent with the partial information available.\nA challenging case, frequently encountered due to privacy issues in the\nanalysis of interbank flows and Big Data, is when there is only local\n(node-specific) aggregate information available. For binary networks, the\nrelevant ensemble is one where the degree (number of links) of each node is\nconstrained to its observed value. However, for weighted networks the problem\nis much more complicated. While the naive approach prescribes to constrain the\nstrengths (total link weights) of all nodes, recent counter-intuitive results\nsuggest that in weighted networks the degrees are often more informative than\nthe strengths. This implies that the reconstruction of weighted networks would\nbe significantly enhanced by the specification of both strengths and degrees, a\ncomputationally hard and bias-prone procedure. Here we solve this problem by\nintroducing an analytical and unbiased maximum-entropy method that works in the\nshortest possible time and does not require the explicit generation of\nreconstructed samples. We consider several real-world examples and show that,\nwhile the strengths alone give poor results, the additional knowledge of the\ndegrees yields accurately reconstructed networks. Information-theoretic\ncriteria rigorously confirm that the degree sequence, as soon as it is\nnon-trivial, is irreducible to the strength sequence.

Computations on systems of various\ncomplexity have shown that convective-RE may increase the number of replica\nround-trips in temperature space with respect to the standard exchange scheme,\nleading to a more effective sampling of energy basins. Moreover, it has been\nshown that the method may prevent the formation of bottlenecks in the diffusive\nwalk of replicas through the space of temperature states.

In detail, these parameters are the variances of the background or\ninput noise, of the initial conditions and of the distribution of the synaptic\nweights. The technique developed in this article can be used to study systems\nwhich are invariant under the exchange of the neural indices and it allows us\nto quantify the correlation structure of the network, in terms of pairwise and\nhigher order correlations between the neurons.

A very\nrich phenomenology (including mechanical, optical and structural effects)\nassociated with the formation of the pipe has been observed in different\nliquids. Actually, the peculiar dynamical evolution of that structure does not\nappear as a trivial manifestation of standard relaxation or spurious effects.\nIn particular we have revealed different time scales during the evolution of\nthe pipe and a non-monotonous decrease of the persistence time with decreasing\nviscosity (with the appearance of at least two different maxima). We put\nforward a microscopic model, consistent with the experimental data, where the\npipe behaves as a \"dielectric shell\" whose time evolution is described through\na simple thermodynamical approach, predicting several properties effectively\nobserved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Jul 2013 00:04:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-10"}

This scheme, directly from\nthermal conduction equation, has been validated as an exact cloak rather than a\nreduced one, and we experimentally confirmed its perfect performance\n(heat-front maintenance and heat protection) in an actual setup.

Transition arcs are labeled with time\nintervals, which specify constraints on the ages of tokens. Furthermore, our\ncost model assigns token storage costs per time unit to places, and firing\ncosts to transitions. This general model strictly subsumes both priced timed\nautomata and unbounded priced Petri nets. We study the cost of computations\nthat reach a given control-state. In general, a computation with minimal cost\nmay not exist, due to strict inequalities in the time constraints. However, we\nshow that the infimum of the costs to reach a given control-state is computable\nin the case where all place and transition costs are non-negative. On the other\nhand, if negative costs are allowed, then the question whether a given\ncontrol-state is reachable with zero overall cost becomes undecidable. In fact,\nthis negative result holds even in the simpler case of discrete time (i.e.,\ninteger-valued clocks).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Jul 2013 19:06:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 9 Nov 2013 22:11:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-01"}

The goal is to explain\nthe underlying concepts in a simple language and give plenty of examples. It is\ntargeted to physicists and engineers and the emphasis is on explanation rather\nthan rigorous proof. The projective model is based on projective geometry and\nClifford algebra. It supplements and enhances vector and matrix algebras. It\nalso subsumes complex numbers and quaternions. Projective geometry augmented\nwith Clifford algebra provides a unified algebraic framework for describing\npoints, lines, planes, etc, and their transformations, such as rotations,\nreflections, projections, and translations. The model is relevant not only to\nEuclidean space but to a variety of homogeneous metric spaces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Jul 2013 08:16:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-12"}
