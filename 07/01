By appropriately tuning\nthe external electric and magnetic fields which determine the Aharonov-Casher\nand Aharonov-Bohm phases, and with some relations between the various hopping\namplitudes and site energies, the interferometer blocks electrons with a\nspecific spin polarization, independent of their energy. The blocked\npolarization and the polarization of the outgoing electrons is controlled\nsolely by the external electric and magnetic fields and do not depend on the\nenergy of the electrons. Furthermore, the spin filtering conditions become\nsimpler in the linear-response regime, in which the electrons have a fixed\nenergy. Unlike the diamond interferometer, spin filtering in the double-dot\ninterferometer does not require high symmetry between the hopping amplitudes\nand site energies of the two branches of the interferometer and thus may be\nmore appealing from an experimental point of view.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Jun 2013 18:16:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-17"}

Many\nconcentrated suspensions of particles exhibit an especially dramatic version,\nknown as Discontinuous Shear Thickening (DST), in which the stress suddenly\njumps with increasing shear rate and produces solid-like behavior. The best\nknown example of such counter-intuitive response to applied stresses occurs in\nmixtures of cornstarch in water. Over the last several years, this\nshear-induced solid-like behavior together with a variety of other unusual\nfluid phenomena has generated considerable interest in the physics of densely\npacked suspensions. In this review, we discuss the common physical properties\nof systems exhibiting shear thickening, and different mechanisms and models\nproposed to describe it. We then suggest how these mechanisms may be related\nand generalized, and propose a general phase diagram for shear thickening\nsystems. We also discuss how recent work has related the physics of shear\nthickening to that of granular materials and jammed systems. Since DST is\ndescribed by models that require only simple generic interactions between\nparticles, we outline the broader context of other concentrated many-particle\nsystems such as foams and emulsions, and explain why DST is restricted to the\nparameter regime of hard-particle suspensions. Finally, we discuss some of the\noutstanding problems and emerging opportunities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Jul 2013 04:32:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

However, conventional ion accelerator tends to\nbe huge in its size and its cost. In this paper a future intense-laser ion\naccelerator is proposed to make the ion accelerator compact. An intense\nfemtosecond pulsed laser was employed to accelerate ions. The issues in the\nlaser ion accelerator include the energy efficiency from the laser to the ions,\nthe ion beam collimation, the ion energy spectrum control, the ion beam\nbunching and the ion particle energy control. In the study particle computer\nsimulations were performed to solve the issues, and each component was designed\nto control the ion beam quality. When an intense laser illuminates a target,\nelectrons in the target are accelerated and leave from the target; temporarily\na strong electric field is formed between the high-energy electrons and the\ntarget ions, and the target ions are accelerated. The energy efficiency from\nthe laser to ions was improved by using a solid target with a fine\nsub-wavelength structure or by a near-critical density gas plasma. The ion beam\ncollimation was realized by holes behind the solid target. The control of the\nion energy spectrum and the ion particle energy, and the ion beam bunching were\nsuccessfully realized by a multi-stage laser-target interaction. The present\nstudy proposed a novel concept for a future compact laser ion accelerator,\nbased on each component study required to control the ion beam quality and\nparameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Jul 2013 07:19:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-02"}

However, fitting high\ndimensional VAR model poses some unique challenges: On one hand, the\ndimensionality, caused by modeling a large number of time series and higher\norder autoregressive processes, is usually much higher than the time series\nlength; On the other hand, the temporal dependence structure in the VAR model\ngives rise to extra theoretical challenges. In high dimensions, one popular\napproach is to assume the transition matrix is sparse and fit the VAR model\nusing the \"least squares\" method with a lasso-type penalty. In this manuscript,\nwe propose an alternative way in estimating the VAR model. The main idea is,\nvia exploiting the temporal dependence structure, to formulate the estimating\nproblem into a linear program. There is instant advantage for the proposed\napproach over the lasso-type estimators: The estimation equation can be\ndecomposed into multiple sub-equations and accordingly can be efficiently\nsolved in a parallel fashion. In addition, our method brings new theoretical\ninsights into the VAR model analysis. So far the theoretical results developed\nin high dimensions (e.g., Song and Bickel (2011) and Kock and Callot (2012))\nmainly pose assumptions on the design matrix of the formulated regression\nproblems. Such conditions are indirect about the transition matrices and not\ntransparent. In contrast, our results show that the operator norm of the\ntransition matrices plays an important role in estimation accuracy. We provide\nexplicit rates of convergence for both estimation and prediction. In addition,\nwe provide thorough experiments on both synthetic and real-world equity data to\nshow that there are empirical advantages of our method over the lasso-type\nestimators in both parameter estimation and forecasting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Jul 2013 07:53:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 25 Nov 2013 22:49:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 29 Oct 2014 02:28:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-30"}

If at least one of the stars has\nevolved off the main sequence (MS), the masses and radii give a strict\nconstraint on the age of the stars. Several dEBs containing a bright K giant\nand a fainter MS star have been discovered by the Kepler satellite. The mass\nand radius of a red giant (RG) star can also be derived from its asteroseismic\nsignal. The parameters determined in this way depend on stellar models and may\ncontain systematic errors. It is important to validate the asteroseismically\ndetermined mass and radius with independent methods. This can be done when\nstars are members of stellar clusters or members of dEBs. KIC 8410637 consists\nof an RG and an MS star. The aim is to derive accurate masses and radii for\nboth components and provide the foundation for a strong test of the\nasteroseismic method and the accuracy of the deduced mass, radius and age. We\nanalyse high-resolution spectra from three different spectrographs. We also\ncalculate a fit to the Kepler light curve and use ground-based photometry to\ndetermine the flux ratios between the component stars in the BVRI passbands. We\nmeasured the masses and radii of the stars in the dEB, and the classical\nparameters Teff, log g and [Fe/H] from the spectra and ground-based photometry.\nThe RG component of KIC 8410637 is most likely in the core helium-burning red\nclump phase of evolution and has an age and composition very similar to the\nstars in the open cluster NGC 6819. The mass of the RG in KIC 8410637 should\ntherefore be similar to the mass of RGs in NGC 6819, thus lending support to\nthe most up-to-date version of the asteroseismic scaling relations. This is the\nfirst direct measurement of both mass and radius for an RG to be compared with\nvalues for RGs from asteroseismic scaling relations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Jul 2013 09:47:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

Based on Monte Carlo (MC) data, we confirm the fact stated earlier\nby Engels and Vogt, that the transverse two-plane correlation function of the\nO(4) model for lattice sizes about L=120 and small external fields h is very\nwell described by a Gaussian approximation. However, we show that fits of not\nlower quality are provided by certain non-Gaussian approximation. We have also\ntested larger lattice sizes, up to L=512. The Fourier-transformed transverse\nand longitudinal two-point correlation functions have Goldstone mode\nsingularities in the thermodynamic limit at k --> 0 and h=+0, i.e., G_perp(k) =\na k^{-lambda_perp} and G_parallel(k) = b k^{-lambda_parallel}, respectively.\nHere a and b are the amplitudes, k is the magnitude of the wave vector. The\nexponents lambda_perp, lambda_parallel and the ratio b M^2/a^2, where M is the\nspontaneous magnetization, are universal according to the GFD (grouping of\nFeynman diagrams) approach. Here we find that the universality follows also\nfrom the standard (Gaussian) theory, yielding b M^2/a^2 = (n-1)/16. Our MC\nestimates of this ratio are 0.06 +/- 0.01 for n=2, 0.17 +/- 0.01 for n=4 and\n0.498 +/- 0.010 for n=10. According to these and our earlier MC results, the\nasymptotic behavior and Goldstone mode singularities are not exactly described\nby the standard theory. This is expected from the GFD theory. We have found\nappropriate analytic approximations for G_perp(k) and G_parallel(k), well\nfitting the simulation data for small k. We have used them to test the\nPatashinski--Pokrovski relation and have found that it holds approximately.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Jul 2013 10:25:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-24"}

A spectral clustering\ntechnique is used to label the noisy observations for each submodel, which\ngenerates estimates of switching time epoches. A total least squares technique\nis used to estimate model parameters and the model input. It is shown that, in\nthe absence of observation noise, the SCS algorithm provides exact parameter\nidentification. At high signal to noise ratios, SCS attains a clairvoyant\nCram\\'{e}r-Rao bound computed by assuming the labeling of observation samples\nis perfect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Jul 2013 10:48:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-02"}

The spectra towards the Sgr B2 star-forming\ncores, B2(M) and B2(N), are characterized by strong CO line emission, emission\nlines from high-density tracers (HCN, HCO+, and H2S), [N II] 205 um emission\nfrom ionized gas, and absorption lines from hydride molecules (OH+, H2O+, H2O,\nCH+, CH, SH+, HF, NH, NH2, and NH3). The rotational population diagrams of CO\nsuggest the presence of two gas temperature components: an extended warm\ncomponent, which is associated with the extended envelope, and a hotter\ncomponent, which is seen towards the B2(M) and B2(N) cores. As observed in\nother Galactic Center clouds, the gas temperatures are significantly higher\nthan the dust temperatures inferred from photometric images.

However, there is only limited work on\nconsistency guarantees for score-based and hybrid algorithms and it has been\nunclear whether consistency guarantees can be proven under weaker conditions\nthan the faithfulness assumption. In this paper, we propose the sparsest\npermutation (SP) algorithm. This algorithm is based on finding the causal\nordering of the variables that yields the sparsest DAG.

Using the\nubiquitous model of a propagating sinusoidal waveform, we identify the limit of\napplicability of the RFT and determine the optimal propulsion gait in terms of\n(i) swimming distance per period of undulation and (ii) hydrodynamic propulsion\nefficiency. The occurrence of the optimal swimming gait maximizing hydrodynamic\nefficiency at finite wavelength in particle-based computations diverges from\nthe prediction of the RFT. To compare the model swimmer powered by sine wave\nundulations to biological undulatory swimmers, we apply the particle-based\napproach to study locomotion of the model organism nematode Caenorhabditis\nelegans using the swimming gait extracted from experiments. The analysis\nreveals that even though the amplitude and the wavenumber of undulations are\nsimilar to those determined for the best performing sinusoidal swimmer, C.\nelegans overperforms the latter in terms of both displacement and hydrodynamic\nefficiency. Further comparison with other undulatory microorganisms reveals\nthat many adopt waveforms with characteristics similar to the optimal model\nswimmer, yet real swimmers still manage to beat the best performing sine-wave\nswimmer in terms of distance covered per period. Overall our results underline\nthe importance of further waveform optimization, as periodic undulations\nadopted by C. elegans and other organisms deviate considerably from a simple\nsine wave.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Jul 2013 13:53:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

The roots of this technology extend back beyond\nMarconi, although the first electronically scanned instrument only appeared in\nthe run-up to World War II. After the war, phased arrays had a major impact in\nmany walks of life, including astronomy and astrophysics. Major progress was\nmade in understanding the nature of the radio sky, including the discovery of\nPulsars. Despite these early successes, parabolic dishes largely replaced\naperture arrays through the 1960's, and right up until the end of the 20th\ncentury. Technological advances in areas such as signal processing, digital\nelectronics, low-power/high performance super-computing and large capacity data\nstorage systems have recently led to a substantial revival in the use of\naperture arrays - especially at frequencies below 300 MHz.

These 46 frequencies range up to 146 c/d. Three years of Kepler data\nreveal distinct sequences of these equidistantly spaced frequencies, including\nthe basic sequence and side lobes associated with other dominant modes (i.e.,\nsmall amplitude modulations). The amplitudes of the basic sequence show a\nhigh-low pattern. The basic sequence follows the equation fm = 2.8519 + m *\n2.81421 c/d with m ranging from 25 to 35. The zero-point offset and the lack of\nlow-order harmonics eliminate an interpretation in terms of a Fourier series of\na non-sinusoidal light curve. The exactness of the spacing eliminates\nhigh-order asymptotic pulsation. The frequency pattern is not compatible with\nsimple hypotheses involving single or multiple spots, even with differential\nrotation. The basic high-frequency sequence is interpreted in terms of prograde\nsectoral modes. These can be marginally unstable, while their corresponding\nlow-degree counterparts are stable due to stronger damping. The measured\nprojected rotation velocity (300 km/s) indicates that the star rotates with\napp. 70% of the Keplerian break-up velocity. This suggests a near equator-on\nview. We qualitatively examine the visibility of prograde sectoral high-degree\ng-modes in integrated photometric light in such a geometrical configuration and\nfind that prograde sectoral modes can reproduce the frequencies and the\nodd-even amplitude pattern of the high-frequency sequence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Jul 2013 14:47:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

In general\nrelativity (GR), radiation pressure from the central luminous star counteracts\ngravitational attraction more strongly than in Newtonian physics. However,\nmotion near the neutron star is very effectively impeded by the radiation\nfield. We discuss coronal ejection in a general relativistic calculation of the\nmotion of a test particle in a spherically symmetric radiation field. At every\nradial distance from the star larger than that of the ISCO, and any initial\nluminosity of the star, there exists a luminosity change which leads to coronal\nejection.
