Two\nsimplifying limits were considered: the weak field limit in which the external\nfield satisfies eB << m^2 (with m being any of the masses involved) and the\nstrong field limit in which the field strength is small in comparison to the\nbottom quark mass (or the B meson mass) squared but it is large compared to the\nmass of the light quarks, i.e., m^2_{u,d} << eB << m^2_{b,B}. We found that m_B\ndecreases with the magnetic field in the both of these limits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Jul 2013 16:04:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-23"}

We show that, due to high\nsurface density of the protoplanetary disk needed for Type III migration, this\nmodel could only lead to planets in a quasi-resonant regime of motion, and thus\nnot consistent with the resonant configuration obtained by Correia et al.\n(2009). Although both resonant and quasi-resonant solutions are statistically\nindistinguishable with respect to radial velocity measurements, their distinct\ndynamical behaviour is intriguing. We use the semi-analytical model to confirm\nthe quantitative difference between two configurations. In order to form a\nsystem evolving inside the 3/2 resonance, we develop a different model. Our\nscenario includes an interaction between different (but slower) planetary\nmigration types, planet growth, and gap formation in the protoplanetary disk.\nThe choice of the described evolutionary path was due to a detailed analysis of\nthe structure of the phase space in the vicinity of the 3/2 MMR employing\ndynamical mapping techniques. The outcomes of our simulations are able to\nreproduce very closely the 3/2 resonant dynamics obtained from the best-fit\npresented by Correia et al. (2009). In addition, varying the strength of the\neccentricity damping, we can also simulate the quasi-resonant configuration\nsimilar to that in Rein et al. (2010).

This work\nintroduces a novel approach for quality estimation by combining learnt\nconfidence scores from a probabilistic inference model based on human\njudgments, with selective linguistic features-based scores, where the proposed\ninference model infers the credibility of given human ranks to solve the\nscarcity and inconsistency issues of human judgments. Experimental results,\nusing challenging language-pairs, demonstrate improvement in correlation with\nhuman judgments over traditional evaluation metrics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Jul 2013 15:04:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-09"}

However, as late as 1985 (see\n\\cite{G}) this hope had not been materialized. The main reason for this is due\nto the lack of controls of the extrinsic properties of the submanifolds by the\nknown intrinsic invariants. In order to overcome such difficulties as well as\nto provide answers to an open question on minimal immersions, we introduced in\nthe early 1990's new types of Riemannian invariants, known as the\n$\\delta$-invariants or the so-called Chen invariants, different in nature from\nthe \"classical\" Ricci and scalar curvatures. At the same time we also able to\nestablish general optimal relations between the new intrinsic invariants and\nthe main extrinsic invariants for Riemannian submanifolds. Since then many\nresults concerning these invariants, inequalities, related subjects, and their\napplications have been obtained by many geometers.\n  The main purpose of this article is thus to provide an extensive and\ncomprehensive survey of results over this very active field of research done\nduring the last fifteen years.

In the standard metric\nformulation of the WCW model, the flatness of the space-time is removed by\nimposing the Weitzenb\\\"{o}ck condition in the Weyl-Cartan geometry, where the\ndynamical variables are the space-time metric, the Weyl vector and the torsion\ntensor, respectively. However, once the Weitzenb\\\"{o}ck condition is imposed on\nthe Weyl-Cartan space-time, the metric is not dynamical, and the gravitational\ndynamics and evolution is completely determined by the torsion tensor. We show\nhow to resolve this difficulty, and generalize the WCW model, by imposing the\nWeitzenb\\\"{o}ck condition on the action of the gravitational field through a\nLagrange multiplier. The gravitational field equations are obtained from the\nvariational principle, and they explicitly depend on the Lagrange multiplier.\nAs a particular model we consider the case of the Riemann-Cartan space-times\nwith zero non-metricity, which mimics the teleparallel theory of gravity.

In addition to its data queues, the SU has an energy queue to\nstore the harvested energy packets. The secondary energy packets are used for\nprimary packets decoding and data packets transmission.
