In addition HD 8801 is a rare pulsating metallic line (Am)\nstar. We determined the astrophysical fundamental parameters to locate HD 8801\nin the HR diagram. We analyzed the element abundances, paying close attention\nto the errors involved, and confirm the nature of HD 8801 as a metallic line\n(Am) star. We also determined an upper limit on the magnetic field strength.\nOur abundance analysis is based on classical techniques, but uses for the final\nstep a model atmosphere calculated with the abundances determined by us. We\nalso discuss spectropolarimetric observations obtained for HD 8801. This object\nis remarkable in several respects. It is a non-magnetic metallic line (Am)\nstar, pulsating simultaneously in p- and g-modes, but also shows oscillations\nwith periods in between these two domains, whose excitation requires\nexplanation. Overall, the pulsational incidence in unevolved classical Am stars\nis believed to be quite low; HD 8801 does not conform to this picture. Finally,\nabout 75% of Am stars are located in short-period binaries, but there is no\nevidence that HD 8801 has a companion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Jul 2013 16:00:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-15"}

In particular, we demonstrate that a series of\nindividual peaks can be assigned either to the optically allowed discrete\ntransitions or to ionization of particular molecular orbitals of the system.\nThe analysis performed gives a detailed information on the nature of numerous\nfeatures in the photoabsorption spectrum of C$_{60}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Jul 2013 17:05:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Oct 2013 15:39:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-07"}

To disentangle different models requires detailed comparisons\nbetween theoretical predictions and multi-wavelength observations. Our previous\nsimulations have demonstrated that the primary features of the Fermi bubbles\ncould be successfully reproduced by recent jet activity from the central active\ngalactic nucleus (AGN). In this work, we generate gamma-ray and microwave maps\nand spectra based on the simulated properties of cosmic rays (CRs) and magnetic\nfields in order to examine whether the observed bubble and haze emission could\nbe explained by leptons contained in the AGN jets. We also investigate the\nmodel predictions of the polarization properties of the Fermi bubbles. We find\nthat: (1) The same population of leptons can simultaneously explain the bubble\nand haze emission given that the magnetic fields within the bubbles are very\nclose to the exponentially distributed ambient field, which can be explained by\nmixing in of the ambient field followed by turbulent field amplification; (2)\nThe centrally peaked microwave profile suggests CR replenishment, which is\nconsistent with the presence of a more recent second jet event; (3) The bubble\ninterior exhibits a high degree of polarization because of ordered radial\nmagnetic field lines stretched by elongated vortices behind the shocks;\nhighly-polarized signals could also be observed inside the draping layer; (4)\nEnhancement of rotation measures could exist within the shock-compressed layer\nbecause of increased gas density and more amplified and ordered magnetic\nfields.

In\naddition to the generic naturalness argument, light higgsinos are well\nmotivated from a top-down perspective.

In the present analysis, we\nstudy two benchmark points which have been derived in the framework of such a\nmodel, which exhibit mass differences of O(GeV) in the higgsino sector.

Since the effect of\nFR is strong due to the large wavelength nature of redshifted 21 cm signal, the\ninitial E-mode signal carried by 21 cm photons is modified in its entirety.

Likewise,\nthe number of stimuli encoded--the capacity--can be enhanced by similarly large\nfactors.

TWR is possible when two nodes exchange data\nsimultaneously through a relay. In cellular systems, data exchange between base\nstation (BS) and users is usually not simultaneous e.g., a user (TUE) has\nuplink data to transmit during multiple access (MAC) phase, but does not have\ndownlink data to receive during broadcast (BC) phase. This non-simultaneous\ndata exchange will reduce TWR to spectrally-inefficient conventional\nhalf-duplex relaying. With infrastructure relays, where multiple users\ncommunicate through a relay, a new transmission protocol is proposed to recover\nthe spectral loss. The BC phase following the MAC phase of TUE is now used by\nthe relay to transmit downlink data to another user (RUE). RUE will not be able\nto cancel the back-propagating interference. A structured precoder is designed\nat the multi-antenna relay to cancel this interference. With multiple-input\nmultiple-output (MIMO) nodes, the proposed precoder also triangulates the\ncompound MAC and BC phase MIMO channels. The channel triangulation reduces the\nweighted sum-rate optimization to power allocation problem, which is then cast\nas a geometric program.

Mutation of Huntingtin (HTT) which causes\nHuntington's disease (HD) and mutations to TP53 which is associated with\ndifferent cancers are studied as two example cases. We construct the PPIN of\nwild type and mutant proteins separately and identify the structural modules of\neach of the networks. The functional role of these modules are then assessed by\nGene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis for biological processes (BPs). We find\nthat a large number of significantly enriched (p<0.0001) GO terms in mutant\nPPIN were absent in the wild type PPIN indicating the gain of BPs due to\nmutation. Similarly some of the GO terms enriched in wild type PPIN cease to\nexist in the modules of mutant PPIN, representing the loss. GO terms common in\nmodules of mutant and wild type networks indicate both loss and gain of BPs. We\nfurther assign relevant biological function(s) to each module by classifying\nthe enriched GO terms associated with it. It turns out that most of these\nbiological functions in HTT networks are already known to be altered in HD and\nthose of TP53 networks are altered in cancers. We argue that gain of BPs, and\nthe corresponding biological functions, are due to new interacting partners\nacquired by mutant proteins.
