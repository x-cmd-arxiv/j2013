Linear, cubic, and quintic\nsusceptibilities, considered simultaneously with the dressing effect, are\nincluded in the analysis. Generally, the beams slowly expand during propagation\nand new vortices are induced, commonly appearing in oppositely charged pairs.\nWe demonstrate that not only the form and the topological charge of the\nincident beam, but also its growing size in the medium greatly affect the\nformation and evolution of vortices. We formulate common rules for finding the\nnumber of induced vortices and the corresponding rotation directions, stemming\nfrom the initial conditions of various incident beams, as well as from the\ndynamical aspects of their propagation. The net topological charge of the\nvortex is conserved during propagation, as it should be, but the total number\nof charges is not necessarily same as the initial number, because of the\ncomplex nature of the system. When the EIT condition is lifted, an enhancement\nregion of beam dynamics if reached, in which the dynamics and the expansion of\nthe beam greatly accelerate. In the end, we discuss the liquid like behavior of\nlight evolution in this dissipative system and propose a potential experimental\nscheme for observing such a behavior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Jul 2013 16:38:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-08"}

Recent research efforts\nhave been aimed at developing wide- area control strategies that involve\ncommunication of remote signals. In conventional wide-area control, the control\nstructure is fixed a priori typically based on modal criteria. In contrast,\nhere we employ the recently-introduced paradigm of sparsity- promoting optimal\ncontrol to simultaneously identify the optimal control structure and optimize\nthe closed-loop performance. To induce a sparse control architecture, we\nregularize the standard quadratic performance index with an l1-penalty on the\nfeedback matrix. The quadratic objective functions are inspired by the classic\nslow coherency theory and are aimed at imitating homogeneous networks without\ninter-area oscillations. We use the New England power grid model to demonstrate\nthat the proposed combination of the sparsity-promoting control design with the\nslow coherency objectives performs almost as well as the optimal centralized\ncontrol while only making use of a single wide-area communication link.

A first step is to stabilize a non-equilibrium state of a\nsimple quantum system such as a qubit or a cavity mode in the presence of\ndecoherence. Several groups have recently accomplished this goal using\nmeasurement-based feedback schemes. A next step is to prepare and stabilize a\nstate of a composite system. Here we demonstrate the stabilization of an\nentangled Bell state of a quantum register of two superconducting qubits for an\narbitrary time. Our result is achieved by an autonomous feedback scheme which\ncombines continuous drives along with a specifically engineered coupling\nbetween the two-qubit register and a dissipative reservoir. Similar autonomous\nfeedback techniques have recently been used for qubit reset and the\nstabilization of a single qubit state, as well as for creating and stabilizing\nstates of multipartite quantum systems. Unlike conventional, measurement-based\nschemes, an autonomous approach counter-intuitively uses engineered dissipation\nto fight decoherence, obviating the need for a complicated external feedback\nloop to correct errors, simplifying implementation. Instead the feedback loop\nis built into the Hamiltonian such that the steady state of the system in the\npresence of drives and dissipation is a Bell state, an essential building-block\nstate for quantum information processing.

This includes structure functions and their exponents, flatness curves\nand correlation functions. In these works, the dependence of structure function\nexponents ($\\zeta_p$) of the order of the structure functions ($\\it{p}$) was\nmodeled using a non-intermittent K41 model. It is now well known that the ARs\nare highly turbulent and are associated with strong intermittent events. In\nthis paper we compare some of the observations from Abramenko et al (2003) with\nthe log-Poisson model (Biskamp 2003) used for modeling intermittent MHD\nturbulent flows. Next, we analyze the structure function data obtained from the\ndirect numerical simulations (DNS) of homogeneous, incompressible 3D-MHD\nturbulence in three cases: sustained by forcing, freely decaying and a flow\ninitially driven and later allowed to decay (case 3). The respective DNS\nreplicate the properties seen in the plots of $\\zeta_p$ against $\\it{p}$ of\nARs. We also reproduce the trends and changes observed in intermittency in\nflatness [Abramenko and Yurchyshyn (2010)] and correlation functions [Abramenko\net al (2003)] of ARs. It is suggested from this analysis that an AR in the\nonset phase of a flare can be treated as a forced 3D-MHD turbulent system in\nits simplest form and that the flaring stage is representative of decaying\n3D-MHD turbulence. It is also inferred that significant changes in\nintermittency from the initial onset phase of a flare to its final peak flaring\nphase, are related to the time taken by the system to reach the initial onset\nphase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Jul 2013 19:01:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-17"}

The slope of A(k) in\nturn reflects the level of conduction. In a non-conductive medium, subsonic\nstirring motions advect density with a similar nearly Kolmogorov cascade.\nIncreasing conduction (via magnetic suppression f = 0.001-1) progressively\nsteepens the spectrum towards the Burgers-like regime. The turbulent Prandtl\nnumber defines the dynamic similarity of the flow; at scales where Pt < 100,\nthe spectrum develops a significant decay. The transition is gentle for highly\nsuppressed conduction, f < 0.001, while sharp in the opposite regime. For\nstrong conductivity (f > 0.1), Pt ~ 100 occurs on spatial scales larger than\nthe injection scale. The velocity spectrum is instead not much affected by\nconduction.

Owing to\ncomputational limitations, the environment is often modeled with simple\nfunctional forms, with a few parameters fit to experiment to yield\nsemi-quantitative results. Growing computational resources have enabled the\nconstruction of more realistic bath models from molecular dynamics (MD)\nsimulations. In this paper, we develop a numerical technique to construct these\natomistic bath models with better accuracy and decreased cost. We apply a novel\nsignal processing technique, known as super-resolution, combined with a\ndictionary of physically-motivated bath modes to derive spectral densities from\nMD simulations.

Here we directly evaluate the effect of the\ncomposition of the core-shell interface on single- and multi-exciton dynamics\nvia side-by-side measurements of individual core-shell CdSe-CdS nanocrystals\nwith a sharp vs. smooth (graded) interface. To realize the latter type of\nstructures, we incorporate a CdSexS1-x alloy layer of controlled composition\nand thickness between the CdSe core and the CdS shell. We observe that while\nhaving essentially no effect on single-exciton decay, the interfacial alloy\nlayer leads to a systematic increase in biexciton lifetimes. This observation\nprovides direct experimental evidence that in addition to the size of the\nquantum dot, its interfacial properties also significantly affect the rate of\nAuger recombination, which governs biexciton decay. These findings help\nrationalize previous observations of a significant heterogeneity in the\nbiexciton lifetimes across similarly sized quantum dots and should facilitate\nthe development of Auger-recombination-free colloidal nanostructures for a\nrange of applications from lasers and light-emitting diodes to photodetectors\nand solar cells.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Jul 2013 21:34:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 Sep 2013 00:17:28 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 20 Sep 2013 20:25:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-24"}

A central notion of parameterized complexity is fixed-parameter\ntractability which extends the classical notion of polynomial-time tractability\nby utilizing the effect of structural properties of the problem input.\n  We draw a detailed map of the parameterized complexity landscape of several\nvariants of problems that arise in the context of case-based planning. In\nparticular, we consider the problem of reusing an existing plan, imposing\nvarious restrictions in terms of parameters, such as the number of steps that\ncan be added to the existing plan to turn it into a solution of the planning\ninstance at hand.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Jul 2013 22:35:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-18"}

These\nprocesses require high-fidelity state preparation as well as minimizing the\ndecoherence that inevitably arises from coupling between the system and the\nenvironment and imperfect control of the system parameters. Here, on the\ncontrary, we combine unitary processes with engineered dissipation to\ndeterministically produce and stabilize an approximate Bell state of two\ntrapped-ion qubits independent of their initial state. While previous works\nalong this line involved the application of sequences of multiple\ntime-dependent gates [3] or generated entanglement of atomic ensembles\ndissipatively but relied on a measurement record for steady-state entanglement\n[4], we implement the process in a continuous time-independent fashion,\nanalogous to optical pumping of atomic states. By continuously driving the\nsystem towards steady-state, the entanglement is stabilized even in the\npresence of experimental noise and decoherence. Our demonstration of an\nentangled steady state of two qubits represents a step towards dissipative\nstate engineering, dissipative quantum computation, and dissipative phase\ntransitions [5-7]. Following this approach, engineered coupling to the\nenvironment may be applied to a broad range of experimental systems to achieve\ndesired quantum dynamics or steady states. Indeed, concurrently with this work,\nan entangled steady state of two superconducting qubits was demonstrated using\ndissipation [8].\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Jul 2013 22:50:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-27"}

The channel\nresources allocation in multi-carrier multi-access channel, which can greatly\nimprove the system throughput with QoS assurance, thus attracted much attention\nfrom both academia and industry. There lacks, however, an analytic framework\nwith a comprehensive performance metric, such that it is difficult to fully\nexploit the potentials of channel allocation. This paper will propose an\nanalytic coded fmatching framework, where the outage exponent region (OER) will\nbe defined as the performance metric. The OER determines the relationship of\nthe outage performance among all of the users in the full SNR range, and\nconverges to the diversity-multiplexing region (DMR) when SNR tends to\ninfinity. To achieve the optimal OER and DMR, the random bipartite graph (RBG)\napproach, only depending on 1 bit CSI, will be proposed to formulate this\nproblem. Based on the RBG formulation, the optimal frequency-domain coding\nbased maximum f-matching method is then proposed. By analyzing the\ncombinatorial structure of the RBG based coded f-matching with the help of\nsaddlepoint approximation, the outage probability of each user, OER, and DMR\nwill be derived in closed-form formulas. It will be shown that all of the users\nshare the total multiplexing gain according to their rate requirements, while\nachieving the full frequency diversity, i.e., the optimal OER and DMR. Based on\nthe principle of parallel computations, the parallel vertices expansion &\nrandom rotation based Hopcroft-Karp (PVER2HK) algorithm, which enjoys a\nlogarithmic polynomial complexity, will be proposed. The simulation results\nwill not only verify the theoretical derivations, but also show the significant\nperformance gains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Jul 2013 01:03:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-18"}

In this paper, we study a different\nformalism, called Priced Resource-Bounded Alternating-time Temporal Logic\n(PRBATL), whose main novelty consists in moving the notion of resources from a\nsyntactic level (part of the formula) to a semantic one (part of the model).\nThis allows us to track the evolution of the resource availability along the\ncomputations and provides us with a formalisms capable to model a number of\nreal-world scenarios. Two relevant aspects are the notion of global\navailability of the resources on the market, that are shared by the agents, and\nthe notion of price of resources, depending on their availability. In a\nprevious work of ours, an initial step towards this new formalism was\nintroduced, along with an EXPTIME algorithm for the model checking problem. In\nthis paper we better analyze the features of the proposed formalism, also in\ncomparison with previous approaches. The main technical contribution is the\nproof of the EXPTIME-hardness of the the model checking problem for PRBATL,\nbased on a reduction from the acceptance problem for Linearly-Bounded\nAlternating Turing Machines. In particular, since the problem has multiple\nparameters, we show two fixed-parameter reductions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Jul 2013 01:43:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-18"}

Such a scenario has been\ndiscussed as a viable model for light (~ 10 GeV) neutralino dark matter as\nexplanation of possible DAMA and CoGeNT direct detection signals. Here we give\nphysical and analytical arguments showing that the sbottom resonance may\nactually not be there. In particular, we show analytically that the one-loop\ngluon-neutralino scattering amplitude has no pole at m_sbottom=m_chi+m_b, while\nby analytic continuation to the regime m_sbottom<m_chi, it develops a pole at\nm_sbottom=m_chi-m_b. In the limit of vanishing gluon momenta, this pole\ncorresponds to the only cut of the neutralino self-energy diagram with a quark\nand a squark running in the loop, when the decay process chi->squark+quark\nbecomes kinematically allowed. The pole can be interpreted as the formation of\na sbottom-antibottom-qqq or antisbottom-bottom qqq resonant state (where qqq\nare the nucleon valence quarks), which is kinematically not accessible if the\nneutralino is the LSP. Our analysis shows that the common practice of\nestimating the neutralino-nucleon cross section by introducing an ad-hoc pole\nat m_sbottom=m_chi+m_b into the effective four-fermion interaction (including\nhigher-twist effects) should be discouraged, since it corresponds to adding a\nspurious pole to the scattering process at the center-of-mass energy sqrt(s)\nm_chi m_sbottom-m_b. Our considerations can be extended from the specific case\nof supersymmetry to other cases in which the dark matter particle scatters off\nnucleons through the exchange of a b-flavored state almost degenerate to its\nmass, such as in theories with extra dimensions and in other mass-degenerate\ndark matter scenarios recently discussed in the literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Jul 2013 01:45:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-26"}

In this compact\nreview we present some clarifications, corrections and further developments of\nthe approach, and provide a brief account of results previously discussed but\nnot reported in the literature. The cross symmetry compound nucleus $S$-matrix\ncorrelations are obtained (i) starting from the unitary $S$-matrix\nrepresentation, (ii) by explicitly taking into account a process of energy\nequilibration, and (iii) without taking the thermodynamic limit of an infinite\nnumber of particles in the thermalized system. It is conjectured that the long\nphase memory is due to the exponentially small total spin off-diagonal\nresonance intensity correlations. This manifestly implies that the strong\nangular asymmetry intimately relates to extremely small deviations of the\neigenfunction distribution from Gaussian law. The spin diagonal resonance\nintensity correlations determine a new time/energy scale for a validity of\nrandom matrix theory. Its definition does not involve overlaps of the many-body\ninteracting configurations with shell model non-interacting states and thus is\nconceptually different from the physical meaning (inverse energy relaxation\ntime) of the spreading widths introduced by Wigner.

When data consist of feature vectors, a\nlarge body of work has focused on learning a Mahalanobis distance. Less work\nhas been devoted to metric learning from structured objects (such as strings or\ntrees), most of it focusing on optimizing a notion of edit distance. We\nidentify two important limitations of current metric learning approaches.\nFirst, they allow to improve the performance of local algorithms such as\nk-nearest neighbors, but metric learning for global algorithms (such as linear\nclassifiers) has not been studied so far. Second, the question of the\ngeneralization ability of metric learning methods has been largely ignored. In\nthis thesis, we propose theoretical and algorithmic contributions that address\nthese limitations. Our first contribution is the derivation of a new kernel\nfunction built from learned edit probabilities. Our second contribution is a\nnovel framework for learning string and tree edit similarities inspired by the\nrecent theory of (e,g,t)-good similarity functions. Using uniform stability\narguments, we establish theoretical guarantees for the learned similarity that\ngive a bound on the generalization error of a linear classifier built from that\nsimilarity. In our third contribution, we extend these ideas to metric learning\nfrom feature vectors by proposing a bilinear similarity learning method that\nefficiently optimizes the (e,g,t)-goodness. Generalization guarantees are\nderived for our approach, highlighting that our method minimizes a tighter\nbound on the generalization error of the classifier. Our last contribution is a\nframework for establishing generalization bounds for a large class of existing\nmetric learning algorithms based on a notion of algorithmic robustness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Jul 2013 06:42:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Jul 2013 17:42:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-25"}

It is useful in visualization of the different objects\npresent in the image. In spite of the several methods available in the\nliterature, image segmentation still a challenging problem in most of image\nprocessing applications. The challenge comes from the fuzziness of image\nobjects and the overlapping of the different regions. Detection of edges in an\nimage is a very important step towards understanding image features. There are\nlarge numbers of edge detection operators available, each designed to be\nsensitive to certain types of edges. The Quality of edge detection can be\nmeasured from several criteria objectively. Some criteria are proposed in terms\nof mathematical measurement, some of them are based on application and\nimplementation requirements. Since edges often occur at image locations\nrepresenting object boundaries, edge detection is extensively used in image\nsegmentation when images are divided into areas corresponding to different\nobjects. This can be used specifically for enhancing the tumor area in\nmammographic images. Different methods are available for edge detection like\nRoberts, Sobel, Prewitt, Canny, Log edge operators. In this paper a novel\nalgorithms for edge detection has been proposed for mammographic images. Breast\nboundary, pectoral region and tumor location can be seen clearly by using this\nmethod.

GCs could also constitute a new class of sources in the\nvery-high-energy (VHE, E>100 GeV) \\gamma-ray regime, judging from the recent\ndetection of emission from the direction of Terzan 5 with the H.E.S.S.\ntelescope array.\n  To search for VHE \\gamma-ray sources associated with other GCs, and to put\nconstraints on leptonic emission models, we systematically analyzed the\nobservations towards 15 GCs taken with H.E.S.S. We searched for individual\nsources of VHE \\gamma-rays from each GC in our sample and also performed a\nstacking analysis combining the data from all GCs to investigate the hypothesis\nof a population of faint emitters. Assuming IC emission as the source of\nemission from Terzan 5, we calculated the expected \\gamma-ray flux for each of\nthe 15 GCs, based on their number of millisecond pulsars, their optical\nbrightness and the energy density of background photon fields.\n  We did not detect significant emission from any of the 15 GCs. The obtained\nflux upper limits allow to rule out the simple IC/msPSR scaling model for NGC\n6388 and NGC 7078. The upper limits derived from the stacking analyses are\nfactors between 2 and 50 below the flux predicted by the simple leptonic model,\ndepending on the assumed source extent and the dominant target photon fields.\nTherefore, Terzan 5 still remains exceptional among all GCs, as the VHE\n\\gamma-ray emission either arises from extra-ordinarily efficient leptonic\nprocesses, or from a recent catastrophic event, or is even unrelated to the GC\nitself.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Jul 2013 09:50:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-14"}

In order to\nrealise the full potential of recent hardware advances, a mixed-mode between\nshared-memory programming techniques and inter-node message passing can be\nadopted which provides high-levels of parallelism with minimal overheads. For\nscientific applications this entails that not only the simulation code itself,\nbut the whole software stack needs to evolve. In this paper, we evaluate the\nmixed-mode performance of PETSc, a widely used scientific library for the\nscalable solution of partial differential equations. We describe the addition\nof OpenMP threaded functionality to the library, focusing on sparse\nmatrix-vector multiplication. We highlight key challenges in achieving good\nparallel performance, such as explicit communication overlap using task-based\nparallelism, and show how to further improve performance by explicitly load\nbalancing threads within MPI processes. Using a set of matrices extracted from\nFluidity, a CFD application code which uses the library as its linear solver\nengine, we then benchmark the parallel performance of mixed-mode PETSc across\nmultiple nodes on several modern HPC architectures.

In this paper sets of such response\nfunctions for three different stellar evolutionary stages are tested with new\nempirical [Mg/Fe] abundance data for the MILES stellar spectral library.

We first\nidentify a necessary and sufficient condition for the uniqueness of least\n$\\ell_1$-norm solutions to linear systems. From this condition, we deduce that\na sparsest solution coincides with the unique least $\\ell_1$-norm solution to a\nlinear system if and only if the so-called \\emph{range space property} (RSP)\nholds at this solution. This yields a broad understanding of the relationship\nbetween $\\ell_0$- and $\\ell_1$-minimization problems.

The variability of the\nother 10 mCP candidates is too low to be detectable by their V and I OGLE\nphotometry. The relatively low amplitude variability of the studied LMC mCP\ncandidates sample can be explained by the absence of photometric spots of\noverabundant optically active chemical elements.

In\nparticular they do admit the bitvector frameworks, monotone frameworks, as well\nas idempotent semirings. We show that the algorithms are sound under mild\nassumptions on the flow algebras, mainly that the set of properties constitutes\na join semi-lattice, and complete provided that the transfer functions are\nsuitably distributive (but not necessarily strict).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Jul 2013 11:36:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-18"}

In PNC, multiple users\ntransmit to a relay simultaneously. PNC channel decoding is different from\nconventional multi-user channel decoding: specifically, the PNC relay aims to\ndecode a network-coded message rather than the individual messages of the\nusers. Although prior work has shown that PNC can significantly improve the\nthroughput of a relay network, the improvement is predicated on the\navailability of accurate channel estimates. Channel estimation in PNC, however,\ncan be particularly challenging because of 1) the overlapped signals of\nmultiple users; 2) the correlations among data symbols induced by channel\ncoding; and 3) time-varying channels. We combine the expectation-maximization\n(EM) algorithm and belief propagation (BP) algorithm on a unified factor-graph\nframework to tackle these challenges. In this framework, channel estimation is\nperformed by an EM subgraph, and channel decoding is performed by a BP subgraph\nthat models a virtual encoder matched to the target of PNC channel decoding.\nIterative message passing between these two subgraphs allow the optimal\nsolutions for both to be approached progressively.

As the analytic\nstructure of the non-singular part is usually very well known (physical cuts\nwith branch points at inelastic thresholds, and unphysical cuts in the negative\nenergy plane), we find that one Pietarinen series per cut represents the\nanalytic structure fairly reliably. The number of terms in each Pietarinen\nseries is determined by the quality of the fit. The method is tested in two\nways: on a toy model constructed from two known poles, various background\nterms, and two physical cuts, and on several sets of realistic piN elastic\nenergy-dependent partial-wave amplitudes (GWU/SAID - [1, 2], and\nDubna-Mainz-Taipei - [3, 4]).

Endocytic vesicle formation depends on the timed production of\nspecific phosphoinositides and their interactions with various endocytic\nproteins. Recently, it has been found that\nphosphatidylinositol-3,4-bisphosphate (PI(3,4)P2) produced by the class II\nphosphatidylinositol 3-kinase C2alpha plays a key role in the recruitment of\nthe PX-BAR domain protein SNX9, which is proposed to play a role in the\nconstriction of the endocytic vesicle neck [Posor et al, Nature 499, p233\n(2013)]. Interestingly, SNX9 and its close paralog SNX18 are not fully specific\nto PI(3,4)P2 but can also bind other phospholipids, in particular to PI(4,5)P2,\nan abundant plasma membrane lipid required for the recruitment of many\nendocytic proteins. In order to understand the dynamical interplay between\nphospholipids and endocytic proteins, we developed a computational model of the\ntemporal changes in the population of the phosphoinositide-associated endocytic\nproteins and their spatial distribution at a clathrin-coated pit (CCP). The\nmodel resolves single molecules in time and space, and incorporates the complex\ninterplay of proteins and lipids, as well as their movement within the CCP. We\nfind that the comparably small differences in lipid binding affinities of\nendocytic proteins are amplified by competition among them, allowing for the\nselective enrichment of SNX9 at late stage CCPs as a result of timed PI(3,4)P2\nproduction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Jul 2013 13:21:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-19"}

Here we investigate requirements that MOAO operation places\non deformable mirrors (DMs) using a full end-to-end Monte-Carlo AO simulation\ncode. By taking into consideration a prior global ground-layer (GL) correction,\nwe show that actuator density for the MOAO DMs can be reduced with little\nperformance loss. We note that this reduction is only possible with the\naddition of a GL DM, whose order is greater than or equal to that of the\noriginal MOAO mirrors. The addition of a GL DM of lesser order does not affect\nsystem performance (if tip/tilt star sharpening is ignored). We also quantify\nthe maximum mechanical DM stroke requirements (3.5 $\\mu$m desired) and provide\ntolerances for the DM alignment accuracy, both lateral (to within an eighth of\na sub-aperture) and rotational (to within 0.2$^\\circ$). By presenting results\nover a range of laser guide star asterism diameters, we ensure that these\nresults are equally applicable for laser tomographic AO systems. We provide the\nopportunity for significant cost savings to be made in the implementation of\nMOAO systems, resulting from the lower requirement for DM actuator density.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Jul 2013 13:27:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

While the two-flavor effective models may be sufficient\nto describe the phenomenon of pion condensation, it is interesting to study the\nroles of the strangeness degree of freedom and the U$_{\\rm A}(1)$ anomaly. In\nthis paper, we present a systematic study of the three-flavor\nNambu--Jona-Lasinio model with a Kobayashi-Maskawa-'t Hooft (KMT) term that\nmimics the U$_{\\rm A}(1)$ anomaly at finite isospin chemical potential. In the\nmean-field approximation, the model predicts a phase transition from the vacuum\nto the pion superfluid phase, which takes place at $\\mu_{\\rm I}$ equal to the\npion mass $m_\\pi$. Due to the U$_{\\rm A}(1)$ anomaly, the strangeness degree of\nfreedom couples to the light quark degrees of freedom and the strange quark\neffective mass depends on the pion condensate. However, the strange quark\ncondensate and the strange quark effective mass change slightly in the pion\nsuperfluid phase, which verifies the validity of the two-flavor models. The\neffective four-fermion interaction of the Kobayashi-Maskawa-'t Hooft term in\nthe presence of the pion condensation is constructed. Due to the U$_{\\rm A}(1)$\nanomaly, the pion condensation generally induces scalar-pseudoscalar\ninteraction. The Bethe-Salpeter equation for the mesonic excitations is\nestablished and the meson mass spectra are obtained at finite isospin chemical\npotential and temperature. Finally, the general expression for the topological\nsusceptibility $\\chi$ at finite isospin chemical potential $\\mu_{\\rm I}$ is\nderived. In contrast to the finite temperature effect which suppresses $\\chi$,\nthe isospin density effect leads to an enhancement of $\\chi$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Jul 2013 13:33:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Sep 2013 20:37:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-19"}

In single stars, stellar aggression towards planetary atmospheres\ncauses mass-loss, which is especially detrimental for late-type stars, because\nhabitable zones are very close and activity is long lasting. In binaries, tidal\nrotational breaking reduces magnetic activity, thus reducing harmful levels of\nXUV radiation and stellar mass-loss that are able to erode planetary\natmospheres. We study this mechanism for all confirmed circumbinary (p-type)\nplanets. We find that main sequence twins provide minimal flux variation and in\nsome cases improved environments, if the stars rotationally synchronize within\nthe first Gyr. Solar-like twins, like Kepler 34 and Kepler 35, provide low\nhabitable zone XUV fluxes and stellar wind pressures. These wide, moist,\nhabitable zones may potentially support multiple habitable planets. Solar-type\nstars with lower mass companions, like Kepler 47, allow for protected planets\nover a wide range of secondary masses and binary periods. Kepler 38 and related\nbinaries are marginal cases. Kepler 64 and analogues have dramatically reduced\nstellar aggression due to synchronization of the primary, but are limited by\nthe short lifetime. Kepler 16 appears to be inhospitable to planets due to\nextreme XUV flux. These results have important implications for estimates of\nthe number of stellar systems containing habitable planets in the Galaxy and\nallow for the selection of binaries suitable for follow-up searches for\nhabitable planets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Jul 2013 13:37:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-29"}

Contrary to available approaches, we\nsuggest, that a strategy of prediction should be based on the fact, that there\nare several kinds of AMP which are vary in mechanisms of action, structure,\nmode of interaction with membrane etc. According to our suggestion for each\nkind of AMP a particular approach has to be developed in order to get high\nefficacy. Consequently in this paper a particular but the biggest class of AMP\n- linear cationic antimicrobial peptides (LCAP) - has been considered and a\nnewly developed simple method of LCAP prediction described. The aim of this\nstudy is the development of a simple method of discrimination of AMP from\nnon-AMP, the efficiency of which will be determined by efficiencies of selected\ndescriptors only and comparison the results of the discrimination procedure\nwith the results obtained by more complicated discriminative methods. As\ndescriptors the physicochemical characteristics responsible for capability of\nthe peptide to interact with an anionic membrane were considered. The following\ncharacteristics such as hydrophobicity, amphiphaticity, location of the peptide\nin relation to membrane, charge, propensity to disordered structure were\nstudied. On the basis of these characteristics a new simple algorithm of\nprediction is developed and evaluation of efficacies of the characteristics as\ndescriptors performed. The results show that three descriptors: hydrophobic\nmoment, charge and location of the peptide along the membranes can be used as\ndiscriminators of LCAPs.

As often implemented in control practice, we replace unavailable\nderivatives with approximate differentiation. Our contribution consists in\nestablishing uniform global asymptotic stability in closed-loop, for Lagrangian\nsystems without dissipative forces (friction) using only position feedback.\nFirstly, for fully-actuated relative-degree-two systems, the controller is\nreminiscent of passivity-based controllers for robot manipulators and consists\nin a linear dynamic system together with a globally-Lipschitz control law.\nEstablishing a global uniform result, all the more with such a simple\ncontroller, is particularly valuable relatively to the literature of\noutput-feedback control of systems with non-globally-Lipschitz nonlinearities\nin the unmeasured variables. This first contribution solves a long-standing\nopen problem and, as a matter of fact, recasted in a general context this\nresult is at the edge of what is achievable -see [24].

In order to understand the fluid dynamics of GTRF\nand to build an archival database of turbulence statistics for various\nconfigurations, implicit large-eddy simulations of time-dependent single-phase\nturbulent flow have been performed in 3x3 and 5x5 rod bundles with a single\ngrid spacer. To assess the computational mesh and resolution requirements, a\nmethod for quantitative assessment of unstructured meshes with no-slip walls is\ndescribed. The calculations have been carried out using Hydra-TH, a\nthermal-hydraulics code developed at Los Alamos for the Consortium for Advanced\nSimulation of Light water reactors, a United States Department of Energy\nInnovation Hub. Hydra-TH uses a second-order implicit incremental projection\nmethod to solve the single-phase incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. The\nsimulations explicitly resolve the large scale motions of the turbulent flow\nfield using first principles and rely on a monotonicity-preserving numerical\ntechnique to represent the unresolved scales. Each series of simulations for\nthe 3x3 and 5x5 rod-bundle geometries is an analysis of the flow field\nstatistics combined with a mesh-refinement study and validation with available\nexperimental data. Our primary focus is the time history and statistics of the\nforces loading the fuel rods. These hydrodynamic forces are believed to be the\nkey player resulting in rod vibration and GTRF wear, one of the leading causes\nfor leaking nuclear fuel which costs power utilities millions of dollars in\npreventive measures. We demonstrate that implicit large-eddy simulation of\nrod-bundle flows is a viable way to calculate the excitation forces for the\nGTRF problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Jul 2013 14:49:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-18"}

In this\nmodel, the emergence of a non-monotonic dependence of T_1 on the external\nmagnetic field is attributed to the Rashba spin-orbit coupling-induced\nanticrossing of opposite spin states. A rapid decrease of T_1 occurs when the\nspin and orbital relaxation rates become comparable in the vicinity of the\nspin-mixing energy-level anticrossing.

Simultaneous measurements\nincluded the sampling of a full planetary rotation, a relevant timescale to\ninvestigate auroral emissions driven by processes internal to the\nmagnetosphere.

Therefore, the\ntransmission between two states of different parity exhibits the AB\noscillations with a \\pi-phase shift, compared to the case of states of same\nparity. On this basis, it is shown that interesting effects such as giant (both\npositive and negative) magnetoresistance and strong negative differential\nconductance can be achieved in this structure. Our study thus presents a new\nproperty of the AB interference, which could be helpful to further understand\nthe transport properties of graphene mesoscopic-systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Jul 2013 15:51:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-02"}
