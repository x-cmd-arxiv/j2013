Here, we take a combined experimental and theoretical\napproach to demonstrate that elastic strain-gradient can be created\ncontrollably and reversibly in ZnO micro/nanowires.

An interesting question in this context is how to\nprepare entanglement and realize quantum information transfer between qubits\nlocated at different cavities, which are important in large-scale quantum\ninformation processing. In this paper, we consider a physical system consisting\nof two cavities and three qubits. Two of the qubits are placed in two different\ncavities while the remaining one acts as a coupler, which is used to connect\nthe two cavities. We propose an approach for generating quantum entanglement\nand implementing quantum information transfer between the two\nspatially-separated intercavity qubits. The quantum operations involved in this\nproposal are performed by a virtual photon process, and thus the cavity decay\nis greatly suppressed during the operations. In addition, to complete the\npresent tasks, only one coupler qubit and one operation step are needed.\nMoreover, there is no need of applying classical pulses, so that the\nengineering complexity is much reduced and the operation procedure is greatly\nsimplified. Finally, our numerical results illustrate that high-fidelity\nimplementation of this proposal using superconducting phase qubits and\none-dimenstion transmision line resonators is feasible for current circuit QED\nimplementations. This proposal can also be applied to other types of\nsuperconducting qubits, including flux and charge qubits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Jul 2013 16:02:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

This answers, in the negative, an open problem posed by\nLokshtanov (PhD Thesis, 2009).\n  Our proof uses the machinery for deriving lower bounds on the size of kernels\ndeveloped by Dell and van Melkebeek (STOC 2010). It has two main ingredients:\nWe first show, by reduction from Vertex Cover, that PLC---conditionally---has\nno kernel of total size $O(k^{2-\\epsilon})$ bits. This does not directly imply\nthe claimed lower bound on the number of points, since the best known\npolynomial-time encoding of a PLC instance with $n$ points requires\n$\\omega(n^{2})$ bits. To get around this we build on work of Goodman et al.\n(STOC 1989) and devise an oracle communication protocol of cost $O(n\\log n)$\nfor PLC; its main building block is a bound of $O(n^{O(n)})$ for the order\ntypes of $n$ points that are not necessarily in general position, and an\nexplicit algorithm that enumerates all possible order types of n points. This\nprotocol and the lower bound on total size together yield the stated lower\nbound on the number of points.\n  While a number of essentially tight polynomial lower bounds on total sizes of\nkernels are known, our result is---to the best of our knowledge---the first to\nshow a nontrivial lower bound for structural/secondary parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Jul 2013 17:25:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-10"}

The multi-frequency behavior indicates that the\nlower frequency events are co-spatial with the \\gamma-ray outbursts, although\nthe \\gamma-ray emission varies on the shortest timescales. We determine that\nthe variability from UV to IR wavelengths during an outburst results from a\nsingle synchrotron component whose properties do not change significantly over\nthe different outbursts. Despite a general increase in the degree of optical\nlinear polarization during an outburst, the polarization drops significantly at\nthe peak of the \\gamma-ray event, which suggests that both shocks and turbulent\nprocesses are involved. We detect two disturbances (knots) with superluminal\napparent speeds in the parsec-scale jet associated with the outbursts in 2009\nAutumn and 2010 Autumn. The kinematic properties of the knots can explain the\ndifference in amplitudes of the \\gamma-ray events, while their millimeter-wave\npolarization is related to the optical polarization during the outbursts. We\ninterpret the multi-frequency behavior within models involving either a system\nof standing conical shocks or magnetic reconnection events located in the\nparsec-scale millimeter-wave core of the jet. We argue that \\gamma-ray\noutbursts with variability timescales as short as ~ 3 hr can occur on parsec\nscales if flares take place in localized regions such as turbulent cells.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Jul 2013 17:29:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

Each shipment\ninvolves transporting goods from the supplier to the warehouse, at a fixed cost\nC, followed by a redistribution of these goods from the warehouse to the\nretailers that ordered them, where transporting goods to a retailer $\\rho$ has\na fixed cost $c_\\rho$. In addition, retailers incur waiting costs for each\norder. The objective is to minimize the overall cost of satisfying all orders,\nnamely the sum of all shipping and waiting costs.\n  JRP has been well studied in Operations Research and, more recently, in the\narea of approximation algorithms. For arbitrary waiting cost functions, the\nbest known approximation ratio is 1.8. This ratio can be reduced to 1.574 for\nthe JRP-D model, where there is no cost for waiting but orders have deadlines.\nAs for hardness results, it is known that the problem is APX-hard and that the\nnatural linear program for JRP has integrality gap at least 1.245. Both results\nhold even for JRP-D. In the online scenario, the best lower and upper bounds on\nthe competitive ratio are 2.64 and 3, respectively.

In particular, Fulling et al. used the finite energy-momentum-stress\ntensor in the presence of a perfectly conducting wedge, calculated many years\nago by Deutsch and Candelas, to compute the torque on one of the wedge\nboundaries, where the latter was cutoff by integrating the torque density down\nto minimum lower radius greater than zero. They observed that that torque is\nnot equal to the negative derivative of the energy obtained by integrating the\nenergy density down to the same minimum radius. This motivated a calculation of\nthe torque and energy in an annular sector obtained by the intersection of the\nwedge with two coaxial cylinders. In a previous paper we showed that for the\nanalogous scalar case, which also exhibited a torque anomaly in the absence of\nthe cylindrical boundaries, the point-split regulated torque and energy indeed\nexhibit an anomaly, unless the point-splitting is along the axis direction. In\nany case, because of curvature divergences, no unambiguous finite part can be\nextracted. However, that ambiguity is linear in the wedge angle; if the\ncondition is imposed that the linear term be removed, the resulting torque and\nenergy is finite, and exhibits no anomaly. In this paper, we demonstrate the\nsame phenomenon takes place for the electromagnetic field, so there is no\ntorque anomaly present here either. This is a nontrivial generalization, since\nthe anomaly found by Fulling et al. is linear for the Dirichlet scalar case,\nbut nonlinear for the conducting electromagnetic case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Jul 2013 18:23:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-29"}

First, the\ninfluence of the orbicularis oris (OO) anatomical implementation was analyzed\nby assessing how changes in depth (from epidermis to the skull) and\nperipheralness (proximity to the lip horn center) affected lip shaping. Second,\nthe capability of the lip/jaw system to generate protrusion and rounding, or\nlabial closure, was evaluated for different jaw heights. Results: Results\nshowed that a peripheral and moderately deep OO implementation is most\nappropriate for protrusion and rounding; a superficial implementation\nfacilitates closure; protrusion and rounding require a high jaw position; and\nclosure is achievable for various jaw heights. Conclusions: Models provide\nobjective information regarding possible links between anatomical and speech\nproduction variability across humans.

The network control\nprotocol is such that within each group agents get to share the resource and\nacross groups they contest for it. A prototypical example is the allocation of\ndata rate on a network with multicast/multirate architecture. Compared to the\nunicast architecture (which is a special case), the multicast/multirate\narchitecture can result in substantial bandwidth savings. However, design of a\nmarket mechanism in such a scenario requires dealing with both private and\npublic good problems as opposed to just private goods in unicast.\n  The mechanism proposed in this work ensures that social welfare maximizing\nallocation on such a network is realized at all Nash equilibria (NE) i.e., full\nimplementation in NE. In addition it is individually rational, i.e., agents\nhave an incentive to participate in the mechanism. The mechanism, which is\nconstructed in a quasi-systematic way starting from the dual of the centralized\nproblem, has a number of useful properties. Specifically, due to a novel\nallocation scheme, namely \"radial projection\", the proposed mechanism results\nin feasible allocation even off equilibrium. This is a practical necessity for\nany realistic mechanism since agents have to \"learn\" the NE through a dynamic\nprocess.

This\npaper considers a new system model that incorporates general transceiver\nhardware impairments at both the BSs (equipped with large antenna arrays) and\nthe single-antenna user equipments (UEs). As opposed to the conventional case\nof ideal hardware, we show that hardware impairments create finite ceilings on\nthe channel estimation accuracy and on the downlink/uplink capacity of each UE.\nSurprisingly, the capacity is mainly limited by the hardware at the UE, while\nthe impact of impairments in the large-scale arrays vanishes asymptotically and\ninter-user interference (in particular, pilot contamination) becomes\nnegligible. Furthermore, we prove that the huge degrees of freedom offered by\nmassive MIMO can be used to reduce the transmit power and/or to tolerate larger\nhardware impairments, which allows for the use of inexpensive and\nenergy-efficient antenna elements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Jul 2013 20:05:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Jan 2014 13:16:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 2 Sep 2014 19:05:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-10"}

In particular, we adopt\npublished photoevaporation prescriptions and examine whether the\nphotoevaporative loss alone, coupled with a range of initial angular momenta of\nthe protostellar cloud, can explain the observed decline of the frequency of\noptically-thick dusty disks with increasing age. In the parameter space we\nexplore, disks have accreting and/or non-accreting transitional phases lasting\nof $\\lesssim20 %$ of their lifetime, which is in reasonable agreement with\nobserved statistics. Assuming that photoevaporation controls disk clearing, we\nfind that initial angular momentum distribution of clouds needs to be weighted\nin favor of slowly rotating protostellar cloud cores. Again, assuming inner\ndisk dispersal by photoevaporation, we conjecture that this skewed angular\nmomentum distribution is a result of fragmentation into binary or multiple\nstellar systems in rapidly-rotating cores. Accreting and non-accreting\ntransitional disks show different evolutionary paths on the $\\dot{M}-R_{\\rm\nwall}$ plane, which possibly explains the different observed properties between\nthe two populations. However, we further find that scaling the photoevaporation\nrates downward by a factor of 10 makes it difficult to clear the disks on the\nobserved timescales, showing that the precise value of the photoevaporative\nloss is crucial to setting the clearing times.

Here we present a\ncomprehensive dataset of the 5500(+/-800) Msun infrared dark cloud\nSDC335.579-0.272 (hereafter SDC335) which exhibits a network of cold, dense,\nparsec-long filaments. Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) Cycle 0\nobservations reveal two massive star-forming cores, MM1 and MM2, sitting at the\ncentre of SDC335 where the filaments intersect. With a gas mass of\n545(+770,-385) Msun contained within a source diameter of 0.05pc, MM1 is one of\nthe most massive, compact protostellar cores ever observed in the Galaxy. As a\nwhole, SDC335 could potentially form an OB cluster similar to the Trapezium\ncluster in Orion.

As an alternative and\nimprovement of tensor product real-valued wavelets and dual tree complex\nwavelet transform, recently tensor product complex tight framelets with\nincreasing directionality have been introduced in [8] and applied to image\ndenoising in [13]. Despite several desirable properties, the directional tensor\nproduct complex tight framelets constructed in [8,13] are bandlimited and do\nnot have compact support in the space/time domain. Since compactly supported\nwavelets and framelets are of great interest and importance in both theory and\napplication, it remains as an unsolved problem whether there exist compactly\nsupported tensor product complex tight framelets with directionality.

In Phase I of the experiment eight semi-coaxial and five BEGe type\ndetectors have been deployed. The latter type is used in this field of research\nfor the first time. All detectors are made from material with enriched ^{76}Ge\nfraction. The experimental sensitivity can be improved by analyzing the pulse\nshape of the detector signals with the aim to reject background events. This\npaper documents the algorithms developed before the data of Phase I were\nunblinded. The double escape peak (DEP) and Compton edge events of 2.615 MeV\n\\gamma\\ rays from ^{208}Tl decays as well as 2\\nu\\beta\\beta\\ decays of ^{76}Ge\nare used as proxies for 0\\nu\\beta\\beta\\ decay.

Previous HIFI H2O\nobservations (E_u=53-249 K) and complementary Spitzer mid-IR H2 data are also\nused, with the aim of deriving a complete picture of the excitation conditions.\nAt all selected spots a close spatial association between H2O, mid-IR H2, and\nhigh-J CO emission is found, whereas the low-J CO emission traces either\nentrained ambient gas or a remnant of an older shock.

The [CII] luminosities of the LIRGs in GOALS range from ~10^7 to\n2x10^9 Lsun. We find that LIRGs show a tight correlation of [CII]/FIR with\nfar-IR flux density ratios, with a strong negative trend spanning from ~10^-2\nto 10^-4, as the average temperature of dust increases. We find correlations\nbetween the [CII]/FIR ratio and the strength of the 9.7um silicate absorption\nfeature as well as with the luminosity surface density of the mid-IR emitting\nregion (Sigma_MIR), suggesting that warmer, more compact starbursts have\nsubstantially smaller [CII]/FIR ratios. Pure star-forming (SF) LIRGs have a\nmean [CII]/FIR ~ 4x10^-3, while galaxies with low 6.2um PAH equivalent widths\n(EWs), indicative of the presence of active galactic nuclei (AGN), span the\nfull range in [CII]/FIR.

Moreover, even in LIRGs in\nwhich we detect an AGN in the mid-IR, the majority (2/3) of galaxies show\n[CII]/FIR >= 10^-3 typical of high 6.2um PAH EW sources, suggesting that most\nAGNs do not contribute significantly to the far-IR emission. We provide an\nempirical relation between the [CII]/FIR and the specific SFR (SSFR) for SF\nLIRGs. Finally, we present predictions for the starburst size based on the\nobserved [CII] and far-IR luminosities which should be useful for comparing\nwith results from future surveys of high-redshift galaxies with ALMA and CCAT.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Jul 2013 00:22:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

In addition, the radioactive decay of elements produced in NS\nbinary mergers may result in transients visible in the optical and infrared\nwith peak luminosities on hours-days timescales. Simultaneous observations of\nthe inspiral GWs and signatures in the electromagnetic band may allow us to\ndirectly and independently determine both the luminosity distance and redshift\nto a binary. These standard sirens (the GW analog of standard candles) have the\npotential to provide an accurate measurement of the low-redshift Hubble flow.\nIn addition, these systems are absolutely calibrated by general relativity, and\ntherefore do not experience the same set of astrophysical systematics found in\ntraditional standard candles, nor do the measurements rely on a distance\nladder.

We show that the GRB blast wave in the wind should emit a\nbright GeV flash. It is produced by inverse Compton cooling of the thermal\nplasma behind the forward shock wave. The main part of the flash is shaped by\nscattering of the prompt MeV radiation (emitted at smaller radii) which streams\nthrough the external blast wave. The inverse-Compton flash is bright due to the\nhuge e+- enrichment of the external medium. At late times, the blast wave\nswitches to normal synchrotron-self-Compton cooling. The mechanism is\ndemonstrated by a detailed transfer simulation. The observed prompt MeV\nradiation is taken as an input of the simulation; we use GRB 080916C as an\nexample. The result reproduces the GeV flash observed by the Fermi telescope.\nIt explains the delayed onset, the steep rise, the peak flux, the time of the\npeak, the long smooth decline, and the spectral slope of GeV emission.

In this work, we explore a secondary benefit of caching\nin this architecture through the lens of index coding. We assume a system with\nn users and constant number of caching helpers.

This paradox is related to\nthe role of 'bias' in Cramer-Rao bounds, and is only partially ameliorated via\niterative implementations of the proposed schemes. The results are based on new\ninformation-theoretic bounds for the average information gain and error of any\nphase estimation scheme, and generalise to estimates of shifts generated by any\noperator having discrete eigenvalues.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Jul 2013 06:10:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-11"}

A framed polyhedron is then parametrized by N\nspinors living in C^2 satisfying suitable closure constraints and defines a\nusual convex polyhedron plus a phase for each face. We show that there is an\naction of the unitary group U(N) on this phase space, which changes the shape\nof faces and allows to map any polyhedron onto any other with the same total\narea. This realizes the isomorphism of the space of framed polyhedra with the\nGrassmannian space U(N)/SU(2)*U(N-2). We show how to write averages and\ncorrelations of geometrical observables over the ensemble of polyhedra as\npolynomial integrals over U(N) and we use the Itzykson-Zuber formula from\nmatrix models as the generating function for them. In the quantum case, a\ncanonical quantization of the framed polyhedron phase space leads to the\nHilbert space of SU(2) intertwiners. The individual face areas are quantized as\nhalf-integers (spins) and the Hilbert spaces for fixed total area form\nirreducible representations of U(N). We define coherent intertwiner states\npeaked on classical framed polyhedra and transforming consistently under U(N)\ntransformations. The U(N) character formula can be considered as an extension\nof the Itzykson-Zuber to the quantum level and generates the traces of all\npolynomial observables over the Hilbert space of intertwiners.

In all the cases, first step of\nunfolding is found to be similar, i.e. separation of the cluster formed by\nthree hydrophobic (phenylalanine) residues, namely Phe-7, Phe-11 and Phe-18,\nwhich constitute the hydrophobic core, thereby initiating melting of helix-2 of\nthe protein.

In addition, we searched for a periodic pattern in the frequency\nspectra with the goal of using it to determine the mean density of the star.\nFirst, we extracted the frequency content from the CoRoT light curve. Then, we\nderived the physical parameters of HD174966 and carried a mode identification\nout from the spectroscopic and photometric observations. We used this\ninformation to look for the models fulfilling all the conditions and discussed\nthe inaccuracies of the method because of the rotation effects. In a final\nstep, we searched for patterns in the frequency set using a Fourier transform,\ndiscussed its origin and studied the possibility of using the periodicity to\nobtain information about the physical parameters of the star. A total of 185\npeaks were obtained from the Fourier analysis of the CoRoT light curve, being\nalmost all reliable pulsating frequencies. From the spectroscopic observations,\n18 oscillation modes were detected and identified, and the inclination angle\n($62.5^{\\circ}$$^{+7.5}_{-17.5}$) and the rotational velocity of the star (142\nkm/s) were estimated. From the multi-colour photometric observations, 3\nfrequencies were detected, which correspond to the main ones in the CoRoT light\ncurve. We looked for periodicities within the 185 frequencies and found a\nperiodic pattern ~64 \\mu Hz. Using the inclination angle, the rotational\nvelocity and an Echelle diagram, showing a double comb outside the asymptotic\nregime, we concluded that the periodicity corresponds to a large separation\nstructure. The periodic pattern allowed us to discriminate models from a grid,\nfinding that the value of the mean density is achieved with a 6% uncertainty.\nSo, the pattern could be used as a new observable for A-F type stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Jul 2013 10:07:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

The imaging and timing properties of {\\gamma}-ray emission from\nelectromagnetic cascades initiated by very-high-energy (VHE) {\\gamma}-rays in\nthe intergalactic medium depend on the strength B and correlation length\n{\\lambda}B of intergalactic magnetic fields (IGMF). Aims. We study the\npossibility of measuring both B and {\\lambda}B via observations of the cascade\nemission with {\\gamma}-ray telescopes. Methods. For each measurement method, we\nfind two characteristics of the cascade signal, which are sensitive to the IGMF\nB and {\\lambda}B values in different combinations. For the case of IGMF\nmeasurement using the observation of extended emission around extragalactic VHE\n{\\gamma}-ray sources, the two characteristics are the slope of the surface\nbrightness profile and the overall size of the cascade source. For the case of\nIGMF measurement from the time delayed emission, these two characteristics are\nthe initial slope of the cascade emission light curve and the overall duration\nof the cascade signal. Results. We show that measurement of the slope of the\ncascade induced extended emission and/or light curve can both potentially\nprovide measure of the IGMF correlation length, provided it lies within the\nrange 10 kpc< {\\lambda}B <1 Mpc. For correlation lengths outside this range,\ngamma-ray observations can provide upper or lower bound on {\\lambda}B.

In the case of pure external\nshear stress, we demonstrate that this is a 2-dimensional triangular lattice of\nsimilar elementary events. It is shown that this lattice is arranged on a\nplane, that, similarly to the 2-D case, makes an angle of 45 degrees with\nrespect to the principal stress axis. This solution is energetically favorable\nonly if the external strain exceeds a yield-strain value, which is determined\nby the strain parameters of the elementary events and the Poisson ratio.

Beyond\ncharacterizing precise quality of service (QoS) requirements that accurately\nreflect the UEs' application usage, our proposed cell association approach\naccounts for the devices' hardware type (e.g., smartphone, tablet, laptop).\nThis approach has the practical benefit of enabling the small cells to make\nbetter informed cell association decisions that handle practical\ndevice-specific QoS characteristics. We formulate the problem as a matching\ngame between small cell base stations (SBSs) and UEs. In this game, the SBSs\nand UEs rank one another based on well-designed utility functions that capture\ncomposite QoS requirements, extracted from the context features (i.e.,\napplication in use, hardware type). We show that the preferences used by the\nnodes to rank one another are interdependent and influenced by the existing\nnetwork-wide matching. Due to this unique feature of the preferences, we show\nthat the proposed game can be classified as a many-to-one matching game with\nexternalities. To solve this game, we propose a distributed algorithm that\nenables the players (i.e., UEs and SBSs) to self-organize into a stable\nmatching that guarantees the required applications' QoS. Simulation results\nshow that the proposed context-aware cell association scheme yields significant\ngains, reaching up to 52% improvement compared to baseline context-unaware\napproaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Jul 2013 12:00:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-11"}

Here\nwe demonstrate that the sound excited by helical particles on surfaces of\ntopological insulators has several exotic properties fundamentally different\nfrom sound propagating in non-helical or even isotropic helical systems.\nSpecifically, the sound may have strictly forward propagation absent for\nisotropic helical states. Its dependence on the anisotropy of the realistic\nsurface-states is of distinguished behavior which may be used as an alternative\nexperimental tool to measure the anisotropy strength. Fascinating from the\nfundamental point of view backward, or anomalous, Cherenkov sound is excited\nabove the critical angle $\\pi/2$ when the anisotropy exceeds a critical value.\nStrikingly, at strong anisotropy the sound localizes into a few forward and\nbackward beams propagating along specific directions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Jul 2013 12:51:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 Nov 2013 12:39:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-08"}

The most characteristic examples of such systems are\nthe volunteer computing and the crowdsourcing platforms. In both examples end\nusers are offering over the Internet their computing power or their human\nintelligence to solve tasks either voluntarily or under payment. While the main\nadvantage of these systems is the inexpensive computational power provided, the\nmain drawback is the untrustworthy nature of the end users. Generally, this\ntype of systems are modeled under the \"master-worker\" setting. A \"master\" has a\nset of tasks to compute and instead of computing them locally she sends these\ntasks to available \"workers\" that compute and report back the task results. We\ncategorize these workers in three generic types: altruistic, malicious and\nrational. Altruistic workers that always return the correct result, malicious\nworkers that always return an incorrect result, and rational workers that\ndecide to reply or not truthfully depending on what increases their benefit. We\ndesign a reinforcement learning mechanism to induce a correct behavior to\nrational workers, while the mechanism is complemented by four reputation\nschemes that cope with malice. The goal of the mechanism is to reach a state of\neventual correctness, that is, a stable state of the system in which the master\nalways obtains the correct task results. Analysis of the system gives provable\nguarantees under which truthful behavior can be ensured. Finally, we observe\nthe behavior of the mechanism through simulations that use realistic system\nparameters values. Simulations not only agree with the analysis but also reveal\ninteresting trade-offs between various metrics and parameters. Finally, the\nfour reputation schemes are assessed against the tolerance to cheaters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Jul 2013 13:18:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 Sep 2013 15:38:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 2 Oct 2013 14:48:40 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 19 Mar 2018 13:10:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-20"}

During the deposition in high vacuum, about 60% of the particles, which\nare uncapped, form larger crystals through oriented attachment. In the present\nconditions of deposition, no selective direction for the oriented attachment is\nnoticed. To probe the driving force of the oriented attachment, and more\nspecifically the possible influence of the dipolar interaction between\nparticles, we have deposited the same nanocrystals in the presence of a\nconstant electric field. The expected effect was to enhance the fraction of\ndomains resulting from the oriented attachment due to the increased interaction\nof the particle dipoles with the electric field. The multiscale analytical and\nstatistical analysis (TEM coupled to XRD) shows no significant influence of the\nelectric field on the organization of the particles. We therefore conclude that\nthe dipolar interaction between nanocrystals is not the prominent driving force\nin the process.

While this design appealed to the gambling\ninstinct, it is a suboptimal way to manage longevity risk during retirement.\nThis is why fair life annuities making constant payments -- where the insurance\ncompany is exposed to the longevity risk -- induces greater lifetime utility.\nHowever, tontines do not have to be designed using a winner-take-all approach\nand insurance companies do not actually sell fair life annuities, partially due\nto aggregate longevity risk.\n  In this paper we derive the tontine structure that maximizes lifetime\nutility, but doesn't expose the sponsor to any longevity risk. We examine its\nsensitivity to the size of the tontine pool; individual longevity risk\naversion; and subjective health status. The optimal tontine varies with the\nindividual's longevity risk aversion $\\gamma$ and the number of participants\n$n$, which is problematic for product design. That said, we introduce a\nstructure called a natural tontine whose payout declines in exact proportion to\nthe (expected) survival probabilities, which is near-optimal for all $\\gamma$\nand $n$. We compare the utility of optimal tontines to the utility of loaded\nlife annuities under reasonable demographic and economic conditions and find\nthat the life annuity's advantage over tontines, is minimal.\n  We also review and analyze the first-ever mortality-derivative issued by the\nBritish government, known as King Williams's tontine of 1693. We shed light on\nthe preferences and beliefs of those who invested in the tontines vs. the\nannuities and argue that tontines should be re-introduced and allowed to\nco-exist with life annuities.

Though edge singularities\nare ubiquitous and play a fundamental role in two-dimensional problems, tensor\nproduct real-valued wavelets are known to be only sub-optimal since they can\nonly capture edges well along the coordinate axis directions. The dual tree\ncomplex wavelet transform (DTCWT), proposed by Kingsbury [16] and further\ndeveloped by Selesnick et al. [24], is one of the most popular and successful\nenhancements of the classical tensor product real-valued wavelets. The\ntwo-dimensional DTCWT is obtained via tensor product and offers improved\ndirectionality with 6 directions. In this paper we shall further enhance the\nperformance of DTCWT for the problem of image denoising. Using framelet-based\napproach and the notion of discrete affine systems, we shall propose a family\nof tensor product complex tight framelets TPCTF_n for all integers n>2 with\nincreasing directionality, where n refers to the number of filters in the\nunderlying one-dimensional complex tight framelet filter bank. For dimension\ntwo, such tensor product complex tight framelet TPCTF_n offers (n-1)(n-3)/2+4\ndirections when n is odd, and (n-4)(n+2)/2+6 directions when n is even. In\nparticular, TPCTF_4, which is different to DTCWT in both nature and design,\nprovides an alternative to DTCWT. Indeed, TPCTF_4 behaves quite similar to\nDTCWT by offering 6 directions in dimension two, employing the tensor product\nstructure, and enjoying slightly less redundancy than DTCWT. When TPCTF_4 is\napplied to image denoising, its performance is comparable to DTCWT. Moreover,\nbetter results on image denoising can be obtained by using TPCTF_6. Moreover,\nTPCTF_n allows us to further improve DTCWT by using TPCTF_n as the first stage\nfilter bank in DTCWT.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Jul 2013 15:21:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-11"}

This quantity is believed to play a key role in\nsolar activity due to its conservation property. Helicity is continuously\ninjected into the corona during the evolution of active regions (ARs). To\nbetter understand and quantify the role of magnetic helicity in solar activity,\nthe distribution of magnetic helicity flux in ARs needs to be studied. The\nhelicity distribution can be computed from the temporal evolution of\nphotospheric magnetograms of ARs such as the ones provided by SDO/HMI and\nHinode/SOT. Most recent analyses of photospheric helicity flux derive an\nhelicity flux density proxy based on the relative rotation rate of photospheric\nmagnetic footpoints. Although this proxy allows a good estimate of the\nphotospheric helicity flux, it is still not a true helicity flux density\nbecause it does not take into account the connectivity of the magnetic field\nlines. For the first time, we implement a helicity density which takes into\naccount such connectivity. In order to use it for future observational studies,\nwe test the method and its precision on several types of models involving\ndifferent patterns of helicity injection. We also test it on more complex\nconfigurations - from magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulations - containing\nquasi-separatrix layers. We demonstrate that this connectivity-based helicity\nflux density proxy is the best to map the true distribution of photospheric\nhelicity injection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Jul 2013 15:38:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-11"}

More generally, V_0(r) may be replaced by the standardized\nRiesz pair-energy V_s(r)= (r^{-s} -1)/s, which becomes - ln r in the limit s to\n0, and the sphere may be replaced by other compact manifolds. This paper\ninquires into the concavity of the map from the integers N>1 into the minimal\naverage standardized Riesz pair-energies v_s(N) of the N-point configurations\non the 2-sphere for various real s. It is known that v_s(N) is strictly\nincreasing for each real s, and for s<2 also bounded above, hence \"overall\nconcave.\" It is (easily) proved that v_{-2}(N) is even locally strictly\nconcave, and that so is v_s(2n) for s<-2. By analyzing computer-experimental\ndata of putatively minimal average Riesz pair-energies v_s^x(N) for s in\n{-1,0,1,2,3} and N in {2,...,200}, it is found that {v}_{-1}^x(N) is locally\nstrictly concave, while v_s^x(N) is not always locally strictly concave for s\nin {0,1,2,3}: concavity defects occur whenever N in C^{x}_+(s) (an s-specific\nempirical set of integers).

The\nintegers in C^{x}_+(0) are few and far between, forming a curious sequence of\nnumbers, reminiscent of the \"magic numbers\" in nuclear physics.
