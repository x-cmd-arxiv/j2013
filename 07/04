The proton distributions and the\nwave dispersions are related through the condition that no further\nion-cyclotron resonant particle scattering or wave growth/damping may take\nplace. The thermal anisotropy of the protons in these states therefore defines\nthe threshold value for triggering the proton-cyclotron anisotropy instability.\nA number of recent papers have noted that the anisotropy of solar wind protons\nat 1 AU does not seem to be limited by the proton-cyclotron anisotropy\nthreshold, even at low plasma beta. However, this puzzle seems to be due solely\nto the estimation of this anisotropy threshold under the assumption that the\nprotons have a bi-Maxwellian distribution. We note that bi-Maxwellian\ndistributions are never marginally stable to the resonant cyclotron\ninteraction, so these estimates do not represent physically valid thresholds.\nThe threshold anisotropies obtained from our marginally stable states are much\nlarger, as a function of proton parallel beta, than the bi-Maxwellian\nestimates, and we show that the measured data remains below these more rigorous\nthresholds. Thus, the results of this paper resolve the apparent contradiction\npresented by the solar wind anisotropy observations at 1 AU: The bi-Maxwellian\nanisotropies are not rigorous thresholds, and so do not limit the proton\ndistributions in the solar wind.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Jul 2013 16:05:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

Collective excitations at magnetic QCPs\ngive rise to metallic properties that strongly deviate from the expectations of\nLandau's Fermi liquid description, the standard theory of electron correlations\nin metals. Central to this theory is the notion of quasiparticles, electronic\nexcitations which possess the quantum numbers of the bare electrons. Here we\nreport measurements of thermal and electrical transport across the\nfield-induced magnetic QCP in the heavy-fermion compound YbRh$_2$Si$_2$. We\nshow that the ratio of the thermal to electrical conductivities at the\nzero-temperature limit obeys the Wiedemann-Franz (WF) law above the critical\nfield, $B_c$. This is also expected at $B < B_c$, where weak antiferromagnetic\norder and a Fermi liquid phase form below 0.07 K ($B = 0$). However, at the\ncritical field the low-temperature electrical conductivity suggests a\nnon-Fermi-liquid ground state and exceeds the thermal conductivity by about\n10%. This apparent violation of the WF law provides evidence for an\nunconventional type of QCP at which the fundamental concept of Landau\nquasiparticles breaks down. These results imply that Landau quasiparticles\nbreak up, and that the origin of this disintegration is inelastic scattering\nassociated with electronic quantum critical fluctuations.

The thesis is divided in three parts. The first one concerns\nthe case when $G$ is a diagonalizable group scheme and it essentially coincides\nwith arxiv:1106.2347. In the second part I deal with the general case. Assuming\nthat the base S is affine and given an $S$-scheme $T$, I interpret $G$-covers\nof $T$ as particolar (lax) monoidal functors from the category of finite,\n$G$-equivariant locally free sheaves over $S$ to the category of finite locally\nfree sheaves over $T$, extending the classical Tannakian correspondence between\n$G$-torsors and strong monoidal functors as above. Using this point of view, I\nprove that $G$-Cov is always reducible if $G$ is a non-abelian linearly\nreductive group. When $G$ is constant and tame I also give a criterion to\ndetect when a $G$-cover of a regular in codimension one, integral scheme has\nregular in codimension one total space in terms of the functor associated with\nthe cover. In the last part I focus on the case $G=S_3$, prove that $S_3$-Cov\nhas exactly two irreducible components and describe the principal one. I also\ndescribe particular open loci of $S_3$-Cov, that is particular families of\n$S_3$-covers, classify $S_3$-covers of regular schemes whose total space is\nregular and compute the invariants of $S_3$-covers of smooth surfaces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Jul 2013 19:27:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-04"}

The \"green\" 5247-5250 line pair\nis unique because it allows the magnetic-field effects to be isolated from the\nthermodynamic effects. No other line pair with this property has since been\nidentified. In recent years much of the magnetic-field diagnostics has been\nbased on the \"red\" Fe I 6301.5 and 6302.5 {\\AA} line pair, since it was chosen\nin the design of the Hinode space observatory. Although thermodynamic effects\nseverely contaminate the magnetic-field signatures for this line ratio, it is\nstill possible to use it to extract information on intrinsic magnetic fields,\nbut only after it has been \"renormalized\", since otherwise it produces\nfictitious, superstrong fields everywhere. In the present work we explore the\njoint behavior of these two line ratios to determine how the \"contaminated\" red\nline ratio can be translated into the corresponding green line ratio, which\nthen allows for a direct interpretation in terms of intrinsic magnetic fields.\nOur observations are mainly based on recordings with the ZIMPOL-3\nspectro-polarimeter at IRSOL in Locarno, Switzerland, complemented by data from\nthe STOP telescope at the Sayan solar observatory (Irkutsk, Russia). The IRSOL\nobservations are unique by allowing both the green and red line pairs to be\nrecorded simultaneously on the same CCD sensor. We show how the line ratios\ndepend on both the measured flux densities and on the heliocentric distance\n(the \\mu\\ value on the solar disk), and finally derive the calibration function\nthat enables the red line ratio to be translated to the green ratio for each\n\\mu\\ value.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Jul 2013 19:34:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

From a well controlled and consecutive\nin-situ intercalation and high temperature de-intercalation approach the\nresponse of each stage up to stage VI is identified. The positions of the G and\n2D lines as a function of staging depend on the charge transfer from K to the\ngraphite layers and on the lattice expansion. Ab-initio calculations of the\ndensity and the electronic band-structure demonstrate that most (but not all)\nof the transferred charge remains on the graphene sheets adjacent to the\nintercalant layers. This leads to an electronic decoupling of these \"outer\"\nlayers from the ones sandwiched between carbon layers and consequently to a\ndecoupling of the corresponding Raman spectra. Thus higher stage GICs offer the\npossibility to measure the vibrations of single, double, and multi-layer\ngraphene under conditions of biaxial strain. This strain can additionally be\ncorrelated to the in-plane lattice constants of GICs determined by x-ray\ndiffraction.

We measure the mid-infrared Butcher-Oemler effect over the\nredshift range 0.0-0.4, finding rapid evolution in the fraction (f_SF) of\nmassive (M_K<-23.1) cluster galaxies within r200 with SFRs>3M_sun/yr, of the\nform f_SF (1+z)^7.6. We dissect the origins of the Butcher-Oemler effect,\nrevealing it to be due to the combination of a ~3x decline in the mean\nspecific-SFRs of star-forming cluster galaxies since z~0.3 with a ~1.5x\ndecrease in number density. Two-thirds of this reduction in the specific-SFRs\nof star-forming cluster galaxies is due to the steady cosmic decline in the\nspecific-SFRs among those field galaxies accreted into the clusters. The\nremaining one-third reflects an accelerated decline in the star formation\nactivity of galaxies within clusters. The slow quenching of star-formation in\ncluster galaxies is consistent with a gradual shut down of star formation in\ninfalling spiral galaxies as they interact with the intra-cluster medium via\nram-pressure stripping or starvation mechanisms. We find no evidence for the\nbuild-up of cluster S0 bulges via major nuclear star-burst episodes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Jul 2013 20:01:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

A method for implementing such an interface between dissimilar qubits\nis quantum teleportation, which has attracted considerable interest not only as\na versatile quantum-state-transfer method but also as a quantum computational\nprimitive. Here, we experimentally demonstrate transfer of quantum information\ncarried by a photonic qubit to a quantum dot spin qubit using quantum\nteleportation. In our experiment, a single photon in a superposition state of\ntwo colors -- a photonic qubit is generated using selective resonant excitation\nof a neutral quantum dot. We achieve an unprecedented degree of\nindistinguishability of single photons from different quantum dots by using\nlocal electric and magnetic field control. To teleport a photonic qubit, we\ngenerate an entangled spin-photon state in a second quantum dot located 5\nmeters away from the first and interfere the photons from the two dots in a\nHong-Ou-Mandel set-up. A coincidence detection at the output of the\ninterferometer heralds successful teleportation, which we verify by measuring\nthe resulting spin state after its coherence time is prolonged by an optical\nspin-echo pulse sequence.

We\nfocus on the case when the driving noise is a fractional Brownian motion, which\nis a common continuous-time modeling device for capturing long-range memory.\nSince the likelihood is intractable, we proceed via data augmentation, adapting\na familiar discretization and missing data approach developed for the white\nnoise case. In addition to the other SDE parameters, we take the Hurst index to\nbe unknown and estimate it from the data. Posterior sampling is performed via a\nHybrid Monte Carlo algorithm on both the parameters and the missing data\nsimultaneously so as to improve mixing. We point out that, due to the\nlong-range correlations of the driving noise, careful discretization of the\nunderlying SDE is necessary for valid inference.

Here we examine X-ray and rest-frame UV spectra of\n8 mini-BAL quasars with outflow speeds in the range 0.1c to 0.2c to test\nwhether extreme speeds require a strong shield.

We use\nphotoionization models to show that this amount of shielding is too weak to\ncontrol the outflow ionizations and, therefore, it is not important for the\nacceleration. Shielding in complex geometries also seems unlikely because the\nalleged shield would need to extinguish the ionizing far-UV flux while avoiding\ndetection in X-rays and the near-UV.\n  We argue that the outflow ionizations are kept moderate, instead, by high gas\ndensities in small clouds.

In the case of a web\nsearch engine this assessment amounts to determining the current size of the\nweb, the growth rate of the web, and the quantity of computing resource\nnecessary to search it, and projecting the historical growth of this into the\nfuture. Method: The over 20 year history of the web makes it possible to make\nshort-term projections on future growth. The longer history of hard disk drives\n(and smart phone memory card) makes it possible to make short-term hardware\nprojections. Analysis: Historical data on Internet uptake and hardware growth\nis extrapolated. Results: It is predicted that within a decade the storage\ncapacity of a single hard drive will exceed the size of the index of the web at\nthat time. Within another decade it will be possible to store the entire\nsearchable text on the same hard drive. Within another decade the entire\nsearchable web (including images) will also fit. Conclusion: This result raises\nquestions about the future architecture of search engines. Several new models\nare proposed. In one model the user's computer is an active part of the\ndistributed search architecture. They search a pre-loaded snapshot (back-file)\nof the web on their local device which frees up the online data centre for\nsearching just the difference between the snapshot and the current time.\nAdvantageously this also makes it possible to search when the user is\ndisconnected from the Internet. In another model all changes to all files are\nbroadcast to all users (forming a star-like network) and no data centre is\nneeded.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Jul 2013 00:38:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-05"}

In this class of memories, a\nsystem can learn multiple driving inputs, nearly all of which are eventually\nforgotten despite their continual input. If sufficient noise is present, the\nsystem regains plasticity so that it can continue to learn new memories\nindefinitely. Recently, Keim & Nagel showed how multiple transient memories\ncould be generalized to a generic driven disordered system with noise, giving\nas an example simulations of a simple model of a sheared non-Brownian\nsuspension.

For the highly bright electron\nbeams, the plasma effect is found to be non-trivial in the development of the\ninstability. In this paper, starting from the Vlasov and Poisson equations in\nthe multiple-dimensional phase space, we perform the straightforward analysis\nof the microbunching instability based on the explicit formula of the\nlongitudinal electric field introduced by the density perturbation in the\nlongitudinal direction, in such a way to be highly comparable to the\nwell-developed method for higher energy beams. This method generally applies in\nboth the cases with and without acceleration and independent of lattice\ncomponents. The results show that for a electron beam with small transverse\nemittance at low energies, which is always the case in the injector of a free\nelectron laser device, the plasma effect results in the oscillation of the\nlongitudinal electric field in the modified plasma frequency that depends on\nthe transverse size of the beam, and the Landau damping effect in the\nlongitudinal electric field due to the uncorrelated longitudinal velocity\nspread during the beam transportation. These two effects both play important\nroles in the development of the instability. As the result, the energy\nmodulation driven by the LSC impedance differs from the regular value\nsignificantly and the discrepancy leads to the noticeable change of the final\ngain of the instability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Jul 2013 03:01:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 Jul 2013 04:36:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 30 Sep 2013 01:53:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-01"}

Defining, identifying and measuring such a\nlength is a subtle and non-trivial problem. Recently, two proposals, based on\nvery different insights regarding the relevant physics, were put forward. One\napproach is based on the point-to-set correlation technique and the other on\nthe scale where the lowest eigenvalue of the Hessian matrix becomes sensitive\nto disorder. In this Letter we present numerical evidence that the two\napproaches might result in the same identical length scale. This provides\nfurther mutual support to their relevance and, at the same time, raise\ninteresting theoretical questions, discussed in the conclusion, concerning the\nfundamental reason for their relationship.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Jul 2013 05:50:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-29"}

We solve the few-electron Schr\\\"odinger\nequation with the exact diagonalization approach and evaluate the energy maps\nin function of the probe position. Next, from the energy maps we try to\nreproduce the charge density distribution using an integral equation given by\nthe perturbation theory. The reproduced density maps are confronted with the\noriginal ones. The present study covers two-dimensional quantum dots of various\ngeometries and profiles with the one-dimensional (1D) quantum dot as a limit\ncase. We concentrate on large quantum dots for which strong electron-electron\ncorrelations appear. For circular dots the correlations lead to formation of\nWigner molecules that in the presence of the tip appear in the laboratory\nframe. The unperturbed rotationally-symmetric charge density is surprisingly\nwell reproduced by the mapping. We find in general that the size of the\nconfined droplet as well as the spatial extent of the charge density maxima is\nunderestimated for repulsive tip potential and overestimated for the attractive\ntip. In lower-symmetry quantum dots the Wigner molecules with single-electron\nislands nucleate for some electron numbers even in the absence of the tip.\nThese charge densities are well resolved by the mapping. The single-electron\nislands appear in the laboratory frame provided that classical point charge\ndensity distribution is unique, in the 1D limit of confinement in particular.\nWe demonstrate that for electron systems which possess a few equivalent\nclassical configurations the repulsive probe switches between the\nconfigurations. In consequence the charge density evades mapping by the\nrepulsive probe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Jul 2013 06:04:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-26"}

The objective of the present article was to understand and quantify\nphysical mechanisms explaining pharyngeal mucosa coating. An elastohydrodynamic\nmodel of swallowing was developed for Newtonian liquids that focused on the\nmost occluded region of the pharyngeal peristaltic wave. The model took\nlubrication by a saliva film and mucosa deformability into account. Food bolus\nflow rate and generated load were predicted as functions of three dimensionless\nvariables: the dimensionless saliva flow rate, the viscosity ratio between\nsaliva and the food bolus, and the elasticity number. Considering physiological\nconditions, the results were applied to predict aroma release kinetics. Two\nsets of conditions were distinguished. The first one was obtained when the\nsaliva film is thin, in which case food bolus viscosity has a strong impact on\nmucosa coating and on flavour release. More importantly, we demonstrated the\nexistence of a second set of conditions. It was obtained when the saliva film\nis thick and the food bolus coating the mucosa is very diluted by saliva during\nthe swallowing process and the impact of its viscosity on flavour release is\nweak. This last phenomenon explains physically in vivo observations for\nNewtonian food products found in the literature.

If the absence of pulsations is interpreted as evidence for the\nemitting surface area being the entire neutron star surface, the assumption of\nthe measured flux being due to a blackbody emission translates into a source\ndistance that is inconsistent with current estimates of the remnant's distance.\nAims: With the best available observational data, we extended the pulse period\nsearch down to a sub-millisecond time scale and used a carbon atmosphere model\nto describe the X-ray spectrum of the CCO and to estimate geometrical\nparameters of the neutron star. Methods: To search for pulsations we used data\nof an observation of the source with XMM-Newton performed in timing mode. For\nthe spectral analysis, we used earlier XMM-Newton observations performed in\nimaging mode, which permits a more accurate treatment of the background. The\ncarbon atmosphere models used to fit the CCO spectrum are computed assuming\nhydrostatic and radiative equilibria and take into account pressure ionization\nand the presence of spectral lines. Results: Our timing analysis did not reveal\nany pulsations with a pulsed fraction above ~8% down to 0.2 ms. This finding\nfurther supports the hypothesis that the emitting surface area is the entire\nneutron star surface. The carbon atmosphere model provides a good fit to the\nCCO spectrum and leads to a normalization consistent with the available\ndistance estimates of the remnant. The derived constraints on the mass and\nradius of the source are consistent with reasonable values of the neutron star\nmass and radius.

The\nfraction of the length of the plumes that undergoes merging decreases with\nincrease in $Ra_w$ as, $L_{pm}/L_p \\sim Ra_w^{-0.04} Pr^{0.1}$. The plumes\nmerge with a constant velocity during their merging cycle, however, the values\nof these constant velocities depend on the location and the time of\nmeasurement.

Observations of polarized radio emission show that large-scale\n(regular) magnetic fields in spiral galaxies are not axisymmetric, but\ngenerally stronger in interarm regions. In some nearby galaxies such as NGC\n6946 they are organized in narrow magnetic arms situated between the material\nspiral arms. Aims. The phenomenon of magnetic arms and their relation to the\noptical spiral arms (the material arms) call for an explanation in the\nframework of galactic dynamo theory. Several possibilities have been suggested\nbut are not completely satisfactory; here we attempt a consistent\ninvestigation. Methods. We use a 2D mean-field dynamo model in the no-z\napproximation and add injections of small-scale magnetic field, taken to result\nfrom supernova explosions, to represent the effects of dynamo action on smaller\nscales. This injection of small scale field is situated along the spiral arms,\nwhere star-formation mostly occurs. Results. A straightforward explanation of\nmagnetic arms as a result of modulation of the dynamo mechanism by material\narms struggles to produce pronounced magnetic arms, at least with realistic\nparameters, without introducing new effects such as a time lag between Coriolis\nforce and {\\alpha}-effect. In contrast, by taking into account explicitly the\nsmall-scale magnetic field that is injected into the arms by the action of the\nstar forming regions that are concentrated there, we can obtain dynamo models\nwith magnetic structures of various forms that can be compared with magnetic\narms. (abbrev). Conclusions. We conclude that magnetic arms can be considered\nas coherent magnetic structures generated by large-scale dynamo action, and\nassociated with spatially modulated small-scale magnetic fluctuations, caused\nby enhanced star formation rates within the material arms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Jul 2013 10:13:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

Moreover, binarity in an eclipsing system constrains the physical\nparameters of the pulsating star. CoRot ID 100866999 is a relatively\nlarge-amplitude hybrid gDor - dSct star with two clearly distinct frequency\ndomains. The large number of detected frequencies allows a detailed study of\nthe interaction between them. In addition, we can derive the fundamental\nparameters of both components from the study of the eclipsing light curve.\nAfter removing the eclipsing phases, we analyzed the data with the Period04\npackage up to S/N=4. The light curve was then prewhitened with these\noscillation frequencies to derive the fundamental parameters of the two\ncomponents. The eclipsing light curve analysis results in a (1.8+1.1)\\,Mo\nsystem, both components being main sequence stars. We detect 124 frequencies\nrelated to luminosity variations of the primary.

These interactions between g- and p-modes confirm the phenomenon\nwe detected in another CoRoT star. The amplitude and the phase of the main\nfrequency F shows a double-wave modulation along the orbital phase, giving rise\nto series of combination frequencies.

The variability of Solar Spectral Irradiance over the rotational\nperiod and its trend over the solar activity cycle are important for\nunderstanding the Sun-Earth connection as well as for observational constraints\nfor solar models. Recently the SIM experiment on SORCE has published an\nunexpected negative correlation with Total Solar Irradiance of the visible\nspectral range. It is compensated by a strong and positive variability of the\nnear UV range. Aims. We aim to verify whether the anti-correlated\nSIM/SORCE-trend in the visible can be confirmed by independent observations of\nthe VIRGO experiment on SOHO. The challenge of all space experiments measuring\nsolar irradiance are sensitivity changes of their sensors due to exposure to\nintense UV radiation, which are difficult to assess in orbit. Methods. We\nanalyze a 10-year time series of VIRGO sun photometer data between 2002 and\n2012. The variability of Spectral Solar Irradiance is correlated with the\nvariability of the Total Solar Irradiance, which is taken as a proxy for solar\nactivity. Results. Observational evidence indicates that after six years only\none single long-term process governs the degradation of the backup sun\nphotometer in VIRGO which is operated once in a month. This degradation can be\nwell approximated by a linear function over ten years. The analysis of the\nresiduals from the linear trend yield robust positive correlations of spectral\nirradiance at 862, 500 and 402 nm with total irradiance. In the analysis of\nannual averages of these data the positive correlations change into weak\nnegative correlations, but of little statistical significance, for the 862 nm\nand 402 nm data. At 500 nm the annual spectral data are still positively\ncorrelated with Total Solar Irradiance. The persisting positive correlation at\n500 nm is in contradiction to the SIM/SORCE results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Jul 2013 11:54:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

The\nshapes of the normal outbursts were characteristic of the outside-in type.\nDuring the rising phase of a normal outburst, the light curve showed periodic\nmodulations with a period of ${\\sim}$ 0.048111(354) d, but the origin of this\npeirod was unclear. We examined daily averaged color-color diagram and found\nthat two cycles exist. This implies that the thermal limit cycle in SU UMa is\ncomplicated. We newly discovered that $g'-R_{\\rm c}$ becomes red about 3 days\nprior to an outburst. Although the working mechanism on this reddening is\nunclear, we propose two possibilities: one is that the inner portion of the\naccretion disk is filled by matter and obscures the central white dwarf, and\nthe other is that the stagnation effect works in the outer region of the\naccretion disk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Jul 2013 12:12:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

The transition is semiclassically\ncalculable at small S^1 size L, occurs as the soft mass m_soft and L vary, and\nis driven by a competition between perturbative effects and nonperturbative\ntopological molecules. These are correlated instanton--anti-instanton tunneling\nevents, whose constituents are monopole-instantons \"bound\" by attractive\nlong-range forces. The mechanism driving the transition is universal for all\nsimple gauge groups, with or without a center, such as SU(N) or G_2. Here, we\nconsider theories with fundamental quarks. We examine the role topological\nobjects play in determining the fate of the (exact or approximate)\ncenter-symmetry in SU(2) SQCD, with or without soft-breaking terms.

We calculate the phase diagram, metallization pressure, phonon\nspectrum, and proton zero-point energy using three popular exchange-correlation\nfunctionals: the local density approximation (LDA), the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof\n(PBE) generalized gradient approximation, and the semi-local\nBecke-Lee-Yang-Parr (BLYP) functional. We focus on the solid molecular\nP$6_3$/m, C2/c, Cmca-12, and Cmca structures in the pressure range from\n$100<P<500$ GPa over which phases I, II and III are observed experimentally. At\nthe static level of theory, in which proton zero-point energy is ignored, the\nLDA, PBE and BLYP functionals give very different structural transition and\nmetallization pressures, with the BLYP phase diagram in better agreement with\nexperiment. Nevertheless, all three functionals provide qualitatively the same\ninformation about the band gaps of the four structures and the phase\ntransitions between them. Going beyond the static level, we find that the\nfrequencies of the vibron modes observed above 3000 cm$^{-1}$ depend strongly\non the choice of exchange-correlation functional, although the low-frequency\npart of the phonon spectrum is little affected. The largest and smallest values\nof the proton zero-point energy, obtained using the BLYP and LDA functionals,\nrespectively, differ by more than 10 meV/proton. Including the proton\nzero-point energy calculated from the phonon spectrum within the harmonic\napproximation improves the agreement of the BLYP and PBE phase diagrams with\nexperiment. Taken as a whole, our results demonstrate the inadequacy of\nmean-field-like density functional calculations of solid molecular hydrogen in\nphases I, II and III and emphasize the need for more sophisticated methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Jul 2013 14:32:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

We present a\ncomprehensive complexity classification of these problems, which strongly links\ngraph-theoretic properties of A to the complexity of the corresponding\nhomomorphism problem. In particular, we define a binary relation on graph\nclasses, which is a preorder, and completely describe the resulting hierarchy\ngiven by this relation. This relation is defined in terms of a notion which we\ncall graph deconstruction and which is a variant of the well-known notion of\ntree decomposition. We then use this hierarchy of graph classes to infer a\ncomplexity hierarchy of homomorphism problems which is comprehensive up to a\ncomputationally very weak notion of reduction, namely, a parameterized version\nof quantifier-free first-order reduction.

The fractions of both ellipticals\nand disks decrease with increasing lookback time at z>1, such that at redshifts\nz=2.5-2.7 and above, the Hubble types cannot be identified, and most galaxies\nare classified as irregular. The quantitative morphological analysis shows\nthat, at 1<z<3, morphological parameters are not as effective in distinguishing\nthe different morphological Hubble types as they are at low redshift.

But comparing both\ncome up a problem of interpretation of the interface density profiles obtained,\nfor example, with the Density Functional Theory (DFT). As a consequence emerge\nthe question of how the surface fluctuations are included on traditional\ndensity profiles (usually named equilibrium density profiles). Last years, new\ninsights on the role of capillary waves were possible by analyzing X-ray\nreflectivity experiments and performing computer simulations of liquids with\nlow melting temperature. In particular, the density profile exhibits a layering\nstructure which is considered a key property to elucidate a new interpretation\nof those profiles as intrinsic density profiles. This dissertation aims to\ninvestigate these questions within the DFT using simple fluids with a pairwise\ninteractions that reproduce important phase-diagram properties of liquid\nmetals. Two generics questions were explored: the relevance of Fisher-Widom\nline and the role of capillary waves on the nature of interface obtained with\napproximations WDA and FMT. It hypothesized the existence of a density profile\nwith strong layering properties whose structure is reduced by capillary waves.\nThen the effect of surface fluctuations is described by introducing an\neffective transversal size which imposes a limitation of the spectrum of\nsurface fluctuations incorporated on the DFT. However, an explicit methodology\nto unfreeze the capillary waves over a postulated intrinsic profile exempt of\nsurface fluctuations was proven still a challenge. As a consequence it\nsuggested that other previous results describing the liquid surface using the\nequilibrium DFT may conduct to unphysical properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Jul 2013 20:07:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-24"}
