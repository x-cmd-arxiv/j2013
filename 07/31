Following the\nmulti-line detections of O2 with low abundances in the Orion and rho Oph A\nmolecular clouds with Herschel, it is important to investigate other\nenvironments, and we here quantify the O2 abundance near a solar-mass\nprotostar. Observations of O2, at 487 GHz toward a deeply embedded low-mass\nClass 0 protostar, NGC 1333-IRAS 4A, are presented, using the HIFI instrument\non the Herschel Space Observatory. Complementary data of the chemically related\nNO and CO molecules are obtained as well. The high spectral resolution data are\nanalysed using radiative transfer models to infer column densities and\nabundances, and are tested directly against full gas-grain chemical models. The\ndeep HIFI spectrum fails to show O2 at the velocity of the dense protostellar\nenvelope, implying one of the lowest abundance upper limits of O2/H2 at\n<6x10^-9 (3 sigma). However, a tentative (4.5 sigma) detection of O2 is seen at\nthe velocity of the surrounding NGC 1333 molecular cloud, shifted by 1 km/s\nrelative to the protostar. For the protostellar envelope, pure gas-phase models\nand gas-grain chemical models require a long pre-collapse phase (~0.7-1x10^6\nyears), during which atomic and molecular oxygen are frozen out onto dust\ngrains and fully converted to H2O, to avoid overproduction of O2 in the dense\nenvelope. The same model also reproduces the limits on the chemically related\nNO molecule. The tentative detection of O2 in the surrounding cloud is\nconsistent with a low-density PDR model with small changes in reaction rates.\nThe low O2 abundance in the collapsing envelope around a low-mass protostar\nsuggests that the gas and ice entering protoplanetary disks is very poor in O2.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Jul 2013 16:11:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-31"}

We suggest a\nspectral classification scheme that separates ULXs into three classes: a\nbroadened disc class, and two-component hard and soft ultraluminous regimes. At\nthe lowest luminosities the ULX population is dominated by sources with\nbroadened disc spectra, whilst two component spectra are seen at higher\nluminosities, suggestive of a distinction between ~ Eddington and\nsuper-Eddington accretion modes. We find high levels of variability are limited\nto ULXs with soft ultraluminous spectra, and a few broadened disc sources.\nFurthermore, the variability is strongest at high energies, suggesting it\noriginates in the harder spectral component. These properties are consistent\nwith current models of super-Eddington emission, where a wind forms a funnel\naround the central regions of the accretion flow. As the wind provides the soft\ncomponent this suggests that inclination is the key determinant in the observed\nX-ray spectra, which is very strongly supported by the variability results if\nthis originates due to clumpy material at the edge of the wind intermittently\nobscuring our line-of-sight to the central regions of the ULX. The pattern of\nspectral variability with luminosity in two ULXs that straddle the hard/soft\nultraluminous regime boundary is consistent with the wind increasing at higher\naccretion rates, and thus narrowing the opening angle of the funnel. Hence,\nthis work suggests that most ULXs can be explained as stellar-mass black holes\naccreting at and above the Eddington limit, with their observed characteristics\ndominated by two variables: accretion rate and inclination.

Proposed methods are mainly\nbased on the use of graphical Gaussian models for observational wild-type data\nand provide undirected graphs that are not able to accurately highlight the\ncausal relationships among genes. In the present work, we seek to improve\nestimation of causal effects among genes by jointly modeling observational\ntranscriptomic data with intervention data obtained by performing knock-outs or\nknock-downs on a subset of genes. By examining the impact of such expression\nperturbations on other genes, a more accurate reflection of regulatory\nrelationships may be obtained than through the use of wild-type data alone.\nResults: Using the framework of Gaussian Bayesian networks, we propose a Markov\nchain Monte Carlo algorithm with a Mallows model and an analytical likelihood\nmaximization to sample from the posterior distribution of causal node\norderings, and in turn, to estimate causal effects. The main advantage of the\nproposed algorithm over previously proposed methods is that it has the\nflexibility to accommodate any kind of intervention design, including partial\nor multiple knock-out experiments. Methods were compared on simulated data as\nwell as data from the DREAM 2007 challenge. Conclusions: The simulation study\nconfirmed the impossibility of estimating causal orderings of genes with\nobservation data only. The proposed algorithm was found, in most cases, to\nperform better than the previously proposed methods in terms of accuracy for\nthe estimation of causal effects. In addition, multiple knock-outs proved to\nbring valuable additional information compared to single knock-outs. The choice\nof optimal intervention design therefore appears to be a crucial aspect for\ncausal inference and an interesting challenge for future research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Jul 2013 16:59:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-31"}

The\nmost numerous and most easily identifiable systems are those in which the main\nsequence companion is an M star, since even if the systems are unresolved the\nwhite dwarf either dominates or is at least competitive with the luminosity of\nthe companion at optical wavelengths. Harder to identify are systems where the\nnon-degenerate component has a spectral type earlier than M0 and the white\ndwarf becomes the less luminous component. Taking Sirius as the prototype,\nthese latter systems are referred to here as Sirius-Like. There are currently\n98 known Sirius-Like systems. Studies of the local white dwarf population\nwithin 20 parsecs indicate that approximately 8 per cent of all white dwarfs\nare members of Sirius-Like systems, yet beyond 20 parsecs the frequency of\nknown Sirius-Like systems declines to between 1 and 2 per cent, indicating that\nmany more of these systems remain to be found. Estimates are provided for the\nlocal space density of Sirius- Like systems and their relative frequency among\nboth the local white dwarf population and the local population of A to K main\nsequence stars. The great majority of currently unidentified Sirius-Like\nsystems will likely turn out to be closely separated and unresolved binaries.\nWays to observationally detect and study these systems are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Jul 2013 17:03:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Aug 2013 20:26:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

We examine the combination of two highly correlated probes of\nlate-time structure growth: (i) weak gravitational lensing from a survey with\nphotometric redshifts and (ii) galaxy clustering and redshift space distortions\nfrom a survey with spectroscopic redshifts. We choose generic survey designs so\nthat our results are applicable to a range of current and future photometric\nredshift (e.g. KiDS, DES, HSC, Euclid) and spectroscopic redshift (e.g. DESI,\n4MOST, Sumire) surveys. Combining the surveys greatly improves their power to\nmeasure both dark energy and modified gravity. An independent, non-overlapping\ncombination sees a dark energy figure of merit more than 4 times larger than\nthat produced by either survey alone. The powerful synergies between the\nsurveys are strongest for modified gravity, where their constraints are\northogonal, producing a non-overlapping joint figure of merit nearly 2 orders\nof magnitude larger than either alone. Our projected angular power spectrum\nformalism makes it easy to model the cross-correlation observable when the\nsurveys overlap on the sky, producing a joint data vector and full covariance\nmatrix. We calculate a same-sky improvement factor, from the inclusion of these\ncross-correlations, relative to non-overlapping surveys. We find nearly a\nfactor of 4 for dark energy and more than a factor of 2 for modified gravity.\nThe exact forecast figures of merit and same-sky benefits can be radically\naffected by a range of forecasts assumption, which we explore methodically in a\nsensitivity analysis.

This paper observes that the NOAA and\nLUMCON have now published errant predictions of possible record size areas of\ntemporary bottom water hypoxia (\"dead zones\") three times since 2005, in 2008,\n2011, and 2013 and that the LUMCON predictions of the area of hypoxic bottom\nwater average 31% higher than the actual measured hypoxic areas from 2006 to\n2014. These systematically high predictions depend on the assumption that the\nsusceptibility of the Gulf of Mexico to forming hypoxic areas in response to\nnutrient loading has been relatively constant since 2001, though the\nsusceptibility has been occasionally adjusted upward in different models. It\nhas been previously suggested that tropical storms in a given year that occur\non the Louisiana-Texas shelf between the peak nutrient loading in spring and\nformation of the hypoxic zone in summer can mitigate the size of the hypoxic\nzone that year through mixing of stratified well oxygenated lighter and warmer\nsurface layers and oxygen depleted heavier and cooler bottom layers.

In this paper, we study the $\\nu=2/k$ FQH-superconductor\nheterostructure and find the superconducting analogue of the $Z_k$ parafermion\nFQH state. Our main tool is the mapping of the FQH into coupled one-dimensional\n(1D) chains each with a pair of counter-propagating modes. We show that by\ninducing intra-chain pairing and charge preserving backscattering with\nidentical couplings, the 1D chains flow into gapless $Z_{k}$ parafermions when\n$k< 4$. By studying the effect of inter-chain coupling, we show that every\nparafermion mode becomes massive except for the two outermost ones. Thus, we\nachieve a fractional topological superconductor whose chiral edge state is\ndescribed by a $Z_k$ parafermion conformal field theory.

One set of modes, that we call \"zero-damping\nmodes\", has vanishing imaginary part in the extremal limit, and exists for all\ncorotating perturbations (i.e., modes with azimuthal index m being\nnonnegative). The other set (the \"damped modes\") retains a finite decay rate\neven for extremal Kerr black holes, and exists only for a subset of corotating\nmodes. As the angular momentum approaches its extremal value, the frequency\nspectrum bifurcates into these two distinct branches when both types of modes\nare present. We discuss the physical reason for the mode branching by\ndeveloping and using a bound-state formulation for the perturbations of generic\nKerr black holes.

However,\nproducing an unambiguous test that can distinguish this model from\nalternatives, such as circumstellar interaction, has proven challenging. After\nthe supernova explosion, the pulsar wind inflates a hot cavity behind the\nexpanding stellar ejecta: the nascent millisecond pulsar wind nebula.\nElectron/positron pairs injected by the wind cool through inverse Compton\nscattering and synchrotron emission, producing a pair cascade and hard X-ray\nspectrum inside the nebula. These X-rays ionize the inner exposed side of the\nejecta, driving an ionization front that propagates outwards with time. Under\nsome conditions this front can breach the ejecta surface within months after\nthe optical supernova peak, allowing ~0.1-1 keV photons to escape the nebula\nunattenuated with a characteristic luminosity L_X ~ 1e43-1e45 erg/s. This\n\"ionization break-out\" may explain the luminous X-ray emission observed from\nthe transient SCP 06F, providing direct evidence that this SLSN was indeed\nengine-powered. Luminous break-out requires a low ejecta mass and that the\nspin-down time of the pulsar be comparable to the photon diffusion timescale at\noptical maximum, the latter condition similar to that required for a supernova\nwith a high optical fluence. These relatively special requirements may explain\nwhy most SLSNe-I are not accompanied by detectable X-ray emission. Global\nasymmetry of the supernova ejecta increases the likelihood of an early\nbreak-out along the direction of lowest density. Atomic states with lower\nthreshold energies are more readily ionized at earlier times near optical\nmaximum, allowing UV break-out across a wider range of pulsar and ejecta\nproperties than X-ray break-out, possibly contributing to the blue/UV colors of\nSLSNe-I.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Jul 2013 20:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

For the explosion\nmodels we use the well-known W7 deflagration model and the delayed detonation\nmodel that was previously shown to provide good fits to the X-ray emission of\nTycho's SNR.\n  Our simulations confirm that a uniform ambient density cannot simultaneously\nreproduce the dynamical and X-ray emission properties of Tycho. In contrast,\nmodels that considered that the remnant was evolving in a dense, but small,\nwind bubble reproduce reasonably well both the measured X-ray emission spectrum\nand the expansion parameter of Tycho's SNR.

The method is particularly\nsuited to study systems that are inhomogeneous, and/or have a boundary. As a\nproof of concept, we use the density matrix renormalization group to solve the\nequivalent one-dimensional problem. The resulting dimensional reduction\ntranslates into a reduction of the scaling of the entanglement entropy by a\nfactor $L^{d-1}$, where L is the linear dimension of the original d-dimensional\nlattice. This allows one to calculate the ground state of a magnetic impurity\nattached to an LxL square lattice and an LxLxL cubic lattice with L up to 140\nsites.

In the case of zigzag\nribbons, the decay of the spin correlations depends on the position of the\nimpurity.

Both sources\nhave previously been observed Lx (2-3)E39 erg/s, at the lower end of the ULX\nluminosity range. The new observations allow us to study these sources in the\nluminosity regime frequented by the Galactic black hole X-ray binaries (BH\nXBs). We present the recent lightcurves of both ULXs. 1RXH J132519.8-430312\n(ULX1) was observed at Lx ~ 1E38 erg/s, while CXOU J132518.2-430304 (ULX2)\ndeclined to Lx ~ 2E37 erg/s and then lingered at this luminosity for hundreds\nof days. We show that a reasonable upper limit for both duty cycles is 0.2,\nwith a lower limit of 0.12 for ULX2. This duty cycle is larger than anticipated\nfor transient ULXs in old stellar populations. By fitting simple spectral\nmodels in an observation with ~50 counts we recover properties consistent with\nGalactic BH XBs, but inconclusive as to the spectral state. We utilise quantile\nanalyses to demonstrate that the spectra are generally soft, and that in one\nobservation the spectrum of ULX2 is inconsistent with a canonical hard state at\n>95% confidence. This is contrary to what would be expected of an accreting\nIMBH primary, which we would expect to be in the hard state at these\nluminosities. We discuss the paucity of transient ULXs discovered in early-type\ngalaxies and excogitate explanations. We suggest that the number of transient\nULXs scales with the giant and sub-giant populations, rather than the total\nnumber of XBs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Jul 2013 22:08:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

Doing so automatically\nallows for regular and systematic testing. A key question is how to generate\nthe attacks. This is naturally formulated as planning under uncertainty, i.e.,\nunder incomplete knowledge about the network configuration. Previous work uses\nclassical planning, and requires costly pre-processes reducing this uncertainty\nby extensive application of scanning methods. By contrast, we herein model the\nattack planning problem in terms of partially observable Markov decision\nprocesses (POMDP). This allows to reason about the knowledge available, and to\nintelligently employ scanning actions as part of the attack. As one would\nexpect, this accurate solution does not scale. We devise a method that relies\non POMDPs to find good attacks on individual machines, which are then composed\ninto an attack on the network as a whole. This decomposition exploits network\nstructure to the extent possible, making targeted approximations (only) where\nneeded. Evaluating this method on a suitably adapted industrial test suite, we\ndemonstrate its effectiveness in both runtime and solution quality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Jul 2013 01:03:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-06"}

Rotation curves are the major tool for determining the\ndynamical mass distribution in the Milky Way and spiral galaxies. The\nphotometric (statistical) method utilizes luminosity profiles from optical and\ninfrared observations, and assumes empirical values of the mass-to-luminosity\n(M/L) ratio to convert the luminosity to mass. In this chapter the dynamical\nmethod is described in detail, and rotation curves and mass distribution in the\nMilky Way and nearby spiral galaxies are presented. The dynamical method is\ncategorized into two methods: the decomposition method and direct method. The\nformer fits the rotation curve by calculated curve assuming several mass\ncomponents such as a bulge, disk and halo, and adjust the dynamical parameters\nof each component. Explanations are given of the mass profiles as the de\nVaucouleurs law, exponential disk, and dark halo profiles inferred from\nnumerical simulations. Another method is the direct method, with which the mass\ndistribution can be directly calculated from the data of rotation velocities\nwithout employing any mass models. Some results from both methods are\npresented, and the Galactic structure is discussed in terms of the mass.\nRotation curves and mass distributions in external galaxies are also discussed,\nand the fundamental mass structures are shown to be universal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Jul 2013 03:35:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

A hyperelliptic curve determines a measure on the\ndiscrete space of rank two bundles on the projective line: the mass of a given\nvector bundle is the number of line bundles whose pushforward it is. In a\nsequence of hyperelliptic curves whose genera tend to infinity, these measures\ntend to the natural measure on the space of rank two bundles. This is a\nfunction field analogue of Duke's theorem on the equidistribution of Heegner\npoints, and can be proven similarly: it follows from a manipulation of zeta\nfunctions, plus the Riemann Hypothesis for curves.\n  Likewise, a sequence of hyperelliptic curves equipped with line bundles gives\nrise to a sequence of measures on the space of pairs of rank 2 bundles.

If this efficiency is achieved, photon-number errors in the\nSPDC sources are sufficiently low as to guarantee correct boson-sampling most\nof the time. In this scheme the required detector efficiency must increase\nexponentially in the photon number.

Whether the stochastic scaling laws used as warning signs are also\npresent in social networks that anticipate a-priori {\\it unknown} events in\nsociety is an exciting open problem, to which at present only highly\nspeculative answers can be given.

Study of the properties of HYbrid MOrphology Radio\nSources (HYMORS) may bring crucial information and lead to a step forward in\nunderstanding the origin of FRI/FRII dichotomy. HYMORS are a rare class of\ndouble-lobed radio sources where each of the two lobes clearly exhibits a\ndifferent FR morphology. This article describes follow-up high resolution VLBA\nobservations of the five discovered by us HYMORS. The main aim of the\nobservations was to answer the questions of whether the unusual radio\nmorphology is connected to the orientation of objects towards the observer. We\nobtained the high resolution radio maps of five hybrid radio morphology objects\nwith the VLBA at C-band and L-band. Two of them revealed milliarcsecond\ncore-jet structures, the next two objects showed hints of parsec-scale jets,\nand the last one remained point-like at both frequencies. We compared\nproperties of observed milliarcsecond structures of hybrid sources with the\nlarger scale ones previously detected with the VLA. We find that on both scales\nthe fluxes of their central components are similar, which may indicate the lack\nof additional emission in the proximity of the nucleus. This suggests that jets\npresent on the 1-10 kpc scale in those objects are FRII-like. When possible,\nthe detected core-jet structures were used for estimating the core's spatial\norientation. The result is that neither the FRI-like nor the FRII-like side is\npreferred, which may suggest that no specific spatial orientation of HYMORS is\nrequired to explain their radio morphology. Their estimated viewing angles\nindicate they are unbeamed objects. The 178 MHz luminosity of observed HYMORS\nexceed the traditional FRI/FRII break luminosity, indicating they have radio\npowers similar to FRIIs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Jul 2013 09:03:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

In this paper, as an\napplication of Helly's theorem, by taking a constant size sample from $S$, we\npresent a testing algorithm for $(k,G)$-clustering, i.e., to distinguish\nbetween two cases: when $S$ is $(k,G)$-clusterable, and when it is\n$\\epsilon$-far from being $(k,G)$-clusterable. A set $S$ is $\\epsilon$-far\n$(0<\\epsilon\\leq1)$ from being $(k,G)$-clusterable if at least $\\epsilon n$\npoints need to be removed from $S$ to make it $(k,G)$-clusterable.

Typically, small-angle neutron scattering\ninstruments are used to investigate a wide range of samples and may often be\nused in a number of configurations. Appropriate standard samples are useful to\ntest different aspects of the performance of hardware as well as that of the\ndata reduction and analysis software. Measurements on a number of instruments\nwith different intrinsic characteristics and designs in a round robin can not\nonly better characterise the performance for a wider range of conditions but\nalso, perhaps more importantly, reveal the limits of the current state of the\nart of small-angle scattering. The exercise, followed by detailed analysis,\ntests the limits of current understanding as well as uncovers often forgotten\nassumptions, simplifications and approximations that underpin the current\npractice of the technique. This paper describes measurements of polystyrene\nlatex, radius 72 nm with a number of instruments. Scattering from monodisperse,\nuniform spherical particles is simple to calculate and displays sharp minima.\nSuch data test the calibrations of intensity, wavelength and resolution as well\nas the detector response. Smoothing due to resolution, multiple scattering and\npolydispersity has been determined. Sources of uncertainty are often related to\nsystematic deviations and calibrations rather than random counting errors. The\nstudy has prompted development of software to treat modest multiple scattering\nand to better model the instrument resolution. These measurements also allow\nchecks of data reduction algorithms and have identified how they can be\nimproved. The reproducibility and the reliability of instruments and the\naccuracy of parameters derived from the data are described.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Jul 2013 12:08:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-11"}

They are also ideal platforms to test\nquantum transport theories that are required to describe charge and energy\ntransfer in novel functional nanodevices. Recent work has successfully probed\nelectric and thermoelectric phenomena in atomic-scale junctions. However, heat\ndissipation and transport in atomic-scale devices remain poorly characterized\ndue to experimental challenges. Here, using custom-fabricated scanning probes\nwith integrated nanoscale thermocouples, we show that heat dissipation in the\nelectrodes of molecular junctions, whose transmission characteristics are\nstrongly dependent on energy, is asymmetric, i.e. unequal and dependent on both\nthe bias polarity and the identity of majority charge carriers (electrons vs.\nholes). In contrast, atomic junctions whose transmission characteristics show\nweak energy dependence do not exhibit appreciable asymmetry. Our results\nunambiguously relate the electronic transmission characteristics of\natomic-scale junctions to their heat dissipation properties establishing a\nframework for understanding heat dissipation in a range of mesoscopic systems\nwhere transport is elastic. We anticipate that the techniques established here\nwill enable the study of Peltier effects at the atomic scale, a field that has\nbeen barely explored experimentally despite interesting theoretical\npredictions.

We assume that distributed nodes observe sparse signals\nwhich share the same sparsity pattern and each node obtains measurements via a\nlow dimensional linear operator. When the measurements are collected at\ndistributed nodes in a communication network, it is often required that joint\nsparse recovery be performed under inherent resource constraints such as\ncommunication bandwidth and transmit/processing power.\n  We present two approaches to take the communication constraints into account\nwhile performing common sparsity pattern recovery.

One of the equivalent definitions\nof PCA is that it seeks the subspaces that maximize the sum of squared pairwise\ndistances between data projections. This definition opens up more flexibility\nin the analysis of principal components which is useful in enhancing PCA. In\nthis paper we introduce scales into PCA by maximizing only the sum of pairwise\ndistances between projections for pairs of datapoints with distances within a\nchosen interval of values [l,u].

Cluster analysis of\nthese projectors reveals the structures in the data at various scales. Each\nstructure is described by the eigenvectors at the medoid point of the cluster\nwhich represent the structure. We also use the distortion of projections as a\ncriterion for choosing an appropriate scale especially for data with outliers.\nThis method was tested on both artificial distribution of data and real data.\nFor data with multiscale structures, the method was able to reveal the\ndifferent structures of the data and also to reduce the effect of outliers in\nthe principal component analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Jul 2013 14:46:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

In 2008, Stembridge identified some common features of the\nKazhdan-Lusztig graphs and gave a combinatorial characterization of all\nW-graphs that have these features. He conjectured, and checked up to n=9, that\nall such A_n-cells are Kazhdan-Lusztig cells. The current paper provides a\nfirst step toward a potential proof of the conjecture. More concretely, we\nprove that the connected subgraphs of A_n-cells consisting of simple (i.e.\ndirected both ways) edges are the same as in the Kazhdan-Lusztig cells.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Jul 2013 15:23:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-01"}

Each telescope comprises a large\nreflector, of order 10 m diameter, made of many mirror facets, and a camera\nconsisting of a matrix of photomultiplier pixels. Differences in the total\nthroughput between nominally identical telescopes, due to aging of the mirrors\nand PMTs and other effects, should be monitored to reduce possible systematic\nerrors. One way to directly measure the throughput of such telescopes is to\ntrack bright stars and measure the photocurrents produced by their light\nfalling on camera pixels. We have developed such a procedure using the four\ntelescopes in the VERITAS array. We note the technique is general, however, and\ncould be applied to other imaging Cherenkov experiments. For this measurement,\na raster scan is performed on a single star such that its image is swept across\nthe central pixels in the camera, thus providing a statistically robust set of\nmeasurements in a short period of time to reduce time-dependent effects on the\nthroughput. Photocurrents are measured using the starlight-induced baseline\nfluctuations of the pixel outputs, as recorded by the standard readout\nelectronics.

The 3D cutting force components experimentally\nmeasured during stainless steel turning are analyzed, and the parameters of\ntheir stochastic dynamics are estimated. Our analysis shows that the system\ninitially exhibiting regular vibrations associated with spindle rotation\nbecomes unstable to high-frequency noisy oscillations (chatter) at larger\ncutting depths. We suggest that the chatter may be attributed to frictional\nstick-and-slip interactions between the contact surfaces of cutting tool and\nworkpiece. We compare our findings with previously reported results obtained by\nstatistical, recurrence, multifractal, and wavelet methods. We discuss the\npotential of FNS in monitoring the turning process in manufacturing practice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Jul 2013 02:37:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

Unfortunately, with\ncomputer simulations it is not possible to completely check that a design\ntransformation is correct in a reasonable amount of time, as the number of test\npatterns required to do so increase exponentially with the number of system\nstate variables. In this paper, we propose a methodology for the verification\nof conformance of models generated at higher levels of abstraction in the\ndesign process to the design specifications. We model the system behavior using\nsequence of recurrence equations. We then use symbolic simulation together with\nequivalence checking and property checking techniques for design verification.\nUsing our proposed method, we have verified the equivalence of three WiMax\nsystem models at different levels of design abstraction, and the correctness of\nvarious system properties on those models. Our symbolic modeling and\nverification experiments show that the proposed verification methodology\nprovides performance advantage over its numerical counterpart.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Jul 2013 03:28:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-02"}

The results based on the linear regression approach\nindicate that some 66% variability of the UK electricity demand can be\nexplained by the quarterly GDP variations, while only 11% of the quarterly\nchanges of the UK electricity demand are caused by seasonal air temperature\nvariations. WTC however, can detect the period of time when GDP and air\ntemperature significantly correlate with electricity demand and the results of\nthe wavelet correlation at different time scales indicate that a significant\ncorrelation is to be found on a long-term basis for GDP and on an annual basis\nfor seasonal air-temperature variations. This approach provides an insight into\nthe properties of the impact of the main factors on power consumption on the\nbasis of which the power system development or operation planning and\nforecasting the power consumption can be improved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Jul 2013 06:51:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-27"}
