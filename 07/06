These maneouvres carry little to no extra energy\ncost, and in previous work it has been shown that a single Voyager-like probe\nexploring the galaxy does so 100 times faster when carrying out these\nslingshots than when navigating purely by powered flight (Forgan et al. 2012).\nWe expand on these results by repeating the experiment with self-replicating\nprobes. The probes explore a box of stars representative of the local Solar\nneighbourhood, to investigate how self-replication affects exploration\ntimescales when compared with a single non-replicating probe.\n  We explore three different scenarios of probe behaviour: i) standard powered\nflight to the nearest unvisited star (no slingshot techniques used), ii) flight\nto the nearest unvisited star using slingshot techniques, and iii) flight to\nthe next unvisited star that will give the maximum velocity boost under a\nslingshot trajectory.\n  In all three scenarios we find that as expected, using self-replicating\nprobes greatly reduces the exploration time, by up to three orders of magnitude\nfor scenario i) and iii) and two orders of magnitude for ii). The second case\n(i.e. nearest-star slingshots) remains the most time effective way to explore a\npopulation of stars. As the decision-making algorithms for the fleet are\nsimple, unanticipated \"race conditions\" amongst probes are set up, causing the\nexploration time of the final stars to become much longer than necessary. From\nthe scaling of the probes' performance with star number, we conclude that a\nfleet of self-replicating probes can indeed explore the Galaxy in a\nsufficiently short time to warrant the existence of the Fermi Paradox.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Jul 2013 16:05:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-08"}

From a modern point of view neutron stars are compact objects\nmaintained by the equilibrium between gravity and the degeneracy pressure of\nthe fermions together with a strong nuclear repulsion force due to the high\ndensity reached in their interior. While the physics in the vicinity of nuclear\nsaturation density is well know from phenomenology, the physics of ultra-dense\nnuclear matter is still an open puzzle. In this work we study dense nuclear\nmatter within a relativistic model, allowing hyperons to be present through\nbeta equilibrium. The presence of hyperons is justifiable since the\nconstituents of neutron stars are fermions. So, according to the Pauli\nprinciple, as the baryon density increases, so do the Fermi momentum and the\nFermi energy. On the other hand, this hyperonic matter softens the equation of\nstate (EoS) and a recent measurement of pulsar PSR J1614-2230 implies that the\nEoS has to be stiff enough to produce a 2.0 $M_{\\odot}$ pulsar.

The aim is to characterise this component in terms of excitation\nconditions and physical origin. A velocity component with an offset of ~10 km/s\ndetected in spectra of the H2O 110-101 557 GHz transition towards six low-mass\nprotostars in the 'Water in star-forming regions with Herschel' (WISH)\nprogramme is also seen in higher-excited H2O lines. The emission from this\ncomponent is quantified and excitation conditions are inferred using 1D slab\nmodels. Data are compared to observations of hydrides (high-J CO, OH+, CH+, C+,\nOH) where the same component is uniquely detected. The velocity component is\ndetected in all 6 targeted H2O transitions (Eup~50-250K), and in CO 16-15\ntowards one source, Ser SMM1. Inferred excitation conditions imply that the\nemission arises in dense (n~5x10^6-10^8 cm^-3) and hot (T~750K) gas. The H2O\nand CO column densities are ~10^16 and 10^18 cm^-2, respectively, implying a\nlow H2O abundance of 10^-2 with respect to CO. The high column densities of\nions such as OH+ and CH+ (both ~10^13 cm^-2) indicate an origin close to the\nprotostar where the UV field is strong enough that these species are abundant.\nThe estimated radius of the emitting region is 100AU. This component likely\narises in dissociative shocks close to the protostar, an interpretation\ncorroborated by a comparison with models of such shocks. Furthermore, one of\nthe sources, IRAS4A, shows temporal variability in the offset component over a\nperiod of two years which is expected from shocks in dense media. High-J CO gas\ndetected with Herschel-PACS with Trot~700K is identified as arising in the same\ncomponent and traces the part of the shock where H2 reforms. Thus, H2O reveals\nnew dynamical components, even on small spatial scales in low-mass protostars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Jul 2013 20:10:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

Tree similarity metrics such\nas a tree edit distance can be used to group changes in order to identify\ngroupings that may represent a single class of change (e.g., adding a parameter\nto a function call). By applying antiunification within each group we are able\nto generalize from families of concrete changes to patterns of structural\nchange. Studying patterns of change at the structural level, instead of\nline-by-line, allows us to gain insight into the evolution of software.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Jul 2013 21:07:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-09"}

A gold standard of the orientation paradigm is the hypothesis\nthat radio galaxies and radio-loud quasars are intrinsically the same, but are\nobserved over different ranges of viewing angles. Historically, strong support\nfor this model was provided by the projected sizes of radio structure in\nluminous radio galaxies, which were found to be significantly larger than those\nof quasars, as predicted due to simple geometric projection. Recently, this\ntest of the simplest prediction of orientation-based models has been revisited\nwith larger samples that cover wider ranges of fundamental properties---and no\nclear difference in projected sizes of radio structure is found. Cast solely in\nterms of viewing angle effects, these results provide convincing evidence that\nunification of these objects solely through orientation fails. However, it is\npossible that conflicting results regarding the role orientation plays in our\nview of radio sources simply result from insufficient sampling of their\nintrinsic size distribution. We test this possibility using Monte-Carlo\nsimulations constrained by real sample sizes and properties. We develop models\nfor the real intrinsic size distribution of radio sources, simulate\nobservations by randomly sampling intrinsic sizes and viewing angles, and\nanalyze how likely each sample is to support or dispute unification by\norientation. We find that, while it is possible to reconcile conflicting\nresults purely within a simple, orientation-based framework, it is very\nunlikely. We analyze the effects that sample size, relative numbers of radio\ngalaxies and quasars, the critical angle that separates the two subclasses, and\nthe shape of the intrinsic size distribution have on this type of test.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Jul 2013 22:27:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

Here we study the dynamics of\ntwo competing pathogens in a structured host population and assess the impact\nof the mobility pattern of hosts on the pathogen competition. We model the\nspatial structure of the host population in terms of a metapopulation network\nand focus on two strains imported locally in the system and having the same\ntransmission potential but different infectious periods. We find different\nscenarios leading to competitive success of either one of the strain or to the\ncodominance of both strains in the system. The dominance of the strain\ncharacterized by the shorter or longer infectious period depends exclusively on\nthe structure of the population and on the the mobility of hosts across\npatches.

Scans might be\nacquired at different times, with patient movement between scans, or with\ndifferent equipment, resulting in multiple datasets that need to be registered.\nFor this issue, we introduce a registration method using anatomical\nfeature-guided mutual information. Prostate scans of the same patient taken in\nthree different orientations are first aligned for the accurate detection of\nanatomical features in 3D. Then, our pipeline allows for multiple modalities\nregistration through the use of anatomical features, such as the interior\nurethra of prostate and gland utricle, in a bijective way. The novelty of this\napproach is the application of anatomical features as the pre-specified\ncorresponding landmarks for prostate registration. We evaluate the registration\nresults through both artificial and clinical datasets.

Embedded within this topography is a fluvial network that is\nsensitive to variations in horizontal and vertical motions. The notion that a\nriver acts as a 'tape recorder' for vertical perturbations suggests that\nchanges in spatial and temporal characteristics of surface uplift can be\ndeduced through the analysis of longitudinal river profiles. We analyse 20\nlongitudinal river profiles around the Australian continent. Concave upward\nprofiles in northeast Australia indicate an absence of recent surface uplift.\nIn contrast, the major knickzones within longitudinal profiles of rivers in\nsouthwest Australia suggest recent surface uplift. Given the lack of recent\nlarge-scale tectonic activity in that region, this uplift requires an\nexplanation. Applying an inverse algorithm to river profiles of south Western\nAustralia reveals that this surface uplift started in the Eocene and culminated\nin the mid-late Neogene. The surface uplift rates deduced from this river\nprofile analysis generally agree with independent geological observations\nincluding preserved shallow-marine sediment outcrops across the Eucla Basin and\nsouth Western Australia.

Advanced LIGO will be sensitive to the inspiral of a $1.4\\,\nM_\\odot$ neutron star into a $10\\,M_\\odot$ black hole to a maximum distance of\n$\\sim 900$ Mpc. Achieving this sensitivity and extracting the physics imprinted\nin observed signals requires accurate modeling of the binary to construct\ntemplate waveforms. In a NSBH binary, the black hole may have significant\nangular momentum (spin), which affects the phase evolution of the emitted\ngravitational waves. We investigate the ability of post-Newtonian (PN)\ntemplates to model the gravitational waves emitted during the inspiral phase of\nNSBH binaries. We restrict the black hole's spin to be aligned with the orbital\nangular momentum and compare several approximants. We examine restricted\namplitude waveforms that are accurate to 3.5PN order in the orbital dynamics\nand complete to 2.5PN order in the spin dynamics. We also consider PN waveforms\nwith the recently derived 3.5PN spin-orbit and 3PN spin-orbit tail corrections.\nWe compare these approximants to the effective-one-body model. For all these\nmodels, large disagreements start at low to moderate black hole spins,\nparticularly for binaries where the spin is anti-aligned with the orbital\nangular momentum. We show that this divergence begins in the early inspiral at\n$v \\sim 0.2$ for $\\chi_{BH} \\sim 0.4$. PN spin corrections beyond those\ncurrently known will be required for optimal detection searches and to measure\nthe parameters of neutron star--black hole binaries. While this complicates\nsearches, the strong dependence of the gravitational-wave signal on the spin\ndynamics will make it possible to extract significant astrophysical\ninformation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Jul 2013 06:50:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 May 2014 18:18:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-21"}

For a connected graph $G$ with vertex connectivity $k\n(k \\geq 1)$, the connectivity augmentation refers to a set $S$ of edges whose\naugmentation to $G$ increases its vertex connectivity by one. A minimum\nconnectivity augmentation of $G$ is the one in which $S$ is minimum. In this\npaper, we focus our attention on connectivity augmentation of trees. Towards\nthis end, we present a new sequential algorithm for biconnectivity augmentation\nin trees by simplifying the algorithm reported in \\cite{nsn}. The simplicity is\nachieved with the help of edge contraction tool. This tool helps us in getting\na recursive subproblem preserving all connectivity information. Subsequently,\nwe present a parallel algorithm to obtain a minimum connectivity augmentation\nset in trees. Our parallel algorithm essentially follows the overall structure\nof sequential algorithm. Our implementation is based on CREW PRAM model with\n$O(\\Delta)$ processors, where $\\Delta$ refers to the maximum degree of a tree.\nWe also show that our parallel algorithm is optimal whose processor-time\nproduct is O(n) where $n$ is the number of vertices of a tree, which is an\nimprovement over the parallel algorithm reported in \\cite{hsu}.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Jul 2013 12:18:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-09"}

Due to\nmany applications, e.g. in data mining, map labeling and admission control, the\nproblem has received a lot of attention by various research communities. We\npresent the first (1+epsilon)-approximation algorithm for the MWISR problem\nwith quasi-polynomial running time 2^{poly(log n/epsilon)}. In contrast, the\nbest known polynomial time approximation algorithms for the problem achieve\nsuperconstant approximation ratios of O(log log n) (unweighted case) and O(log\nn / log log n) (weighted case).\n  Key to our results is a new geometric dynamic program which recursively\nsubdivides the plane into polygons of bounded complexity. We provide the\ntechnical tools that are needed to analyze its performance. In particular, we\npresent a method of partitioning the plane into small and simple areas such\nthat the rectangles of an optimal solution are intersected in a very controlled\nmanner. Together with a novel application of the weighted planar graph\nseparator theorem due to Arora et al. this allows us to upper bound our\napproximation ratio by (1+epsilon).\n  Our dynamic program is very general and we believe that it will be useful for\nother settings. In particular, we show that, when parametrized properly, it\nprovides a polynomial time (1+epsilon)-approximation for the special case of\nthe MWISR problem when each rectangle is relatively large in at least one\ndimension. Key to this analysis is a method to tile the plane in order to\napproximately describe the topology of these rectangles in an optimal solution.\nThis technique might be a useful insight to design better polynomial time\napproximation algorithms or even a PTAS for the MWISR problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Jul 2013 12:41:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-09"}

By weakly coupling the CFT to an auxiliary system, such a\nblack hole can be made to evaporate. In a case where the auxiliary system is a\nsecond identical CFT, it is possible (for specific initial states) that the\nsystem evolves to precisely the thermofield double state as the original black\nhole evaporates. In this case, the dual geometry should include the \"late-time\"\npart of the eternal AdS black hole spacetime which includes smooth spacetime\nbehind the horizon of the original black hole. Thus, we can say that the\nfirewall evaporates. This provides a specific realization of the recent ideas\nof Maldacena and Susskind that the existence of smooth spacetime behind the\nhorizon of an evaporating black hole can be enabled by maximal entanglement\nwith a Hawking radiation system (in our case the second CFT) rather than\nprevented by it. For initial states which are not finely-tuned to produce the\nthermofield double state, the question of whether a late-time infalling\nobserver experiences a firewall translates to a question about the gravity dual\nof a typical high-energy state of a two-CFT system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Jul 2013 15:52:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

The starting\nobservation was that the well-known clash between point-localized gauge\ntheories and the Hilbert space, which hitherto has been solved by using a Krein\nspace setting, can also be solved by preserving the Hilbert space setting; in\nthis case the theory selects the tightest covariant localization which is\nconsistent with the Hilbert space positivity. The resulting semiinfinite\nspacelike string-localization for all (m=0,s>1/2) representations does not only\nlead to a new insight into the origin of infrared problems (including\nconfinement), but also improves the short-distance behavior of massive s>1/2\nfields to the extend that the power-counting criterion admits candidates for\nrenormalizable interactions for arbitrary high spins. In this work the new\nsituation is exemplified for the interaction of massive vectormesons with\nscalar charged- and neutral- (Higgs) matter, for which the new \"adiabatic\nequivalence principle\" leads to a local relation between a renormalizable\nstringlike and a nonrenormalizable (but nevertheless finite-parametric)\npointlike interaction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Jul 2013 19:02:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 Jul 2013 15:42:46 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 8 Jul 2014 15:08:14 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 27 Aug 2014 12:11:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-28"}
