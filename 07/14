To investigate the fine-scale structure of these filaments, we\nperform a depth-dependent inversion of spectropolarimetric data of a sunspot\nvery close to solar disk center obtained by Hinode (SOT/SP). We have used a\nrecently developed spatially coupled 2D inversion scheme which allows us to\nanalyze the fine structure of individual penumbral filaments up to the\ndiffraction limit of the telescope. Filaments of different sizes in all parts\nof penumbra display very similar magnetic field strengths, inclinations and\nvelocity patterns. The similarities allowed us to average all these filaments\nand to extract the physical properties common to all of them. This average\nfilament shows upflows associated with an upward pointing field at its inner,\numbral end and along its axis, downflows along the lateral edge and strong\ndownflows in the outer end associated with a nearly vertical, strong and\ndownward pointing field. The upflowing plasma is significantly hotter than the\ndownflowing plasma. The hot, tear-shaped head of the averaged filament can be\nassociated with a penumbral grain. The central part of the filament shows\nnearly horizontal fields with strengths of ~1kG. The field above the filament\nconverges, whereas a diverging trend is seen in the deepest layers near the\nhead of the filament. We put forward a unified observational picture of a\nsunspot penumbral filament. It is consistent with such a filament being a\nmagneto-convective cell, in line with recent MHD simulations. The uniformity of\nits properties over the penumbra sets constraints on penumbral models and\nsimulations. The complex and inhomogeneous structure of the filament provides a\nnatural explanation for a number of long-running controversies in the\nliterature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Jul 2013 18:32:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

At the same time, a large dynamic range and high\nresolution of low-amplitude signals in a single readout channel per pixel is\nachieved using compression of high amplitude signals in the preamplifier and\nsignal processing in the FPGA. The readout of the front-end modules into a\ncamera server is Ethernet-based using standard Ethernet switches. In its\ncurrent implementation, data transfer and backend processing rates of ~3.8\nGBytes/sec have been achieved. Together with the dead-time-free front end event\nbuffering on the FPGAs, this permits the cameras to operate at trigger rates of\nup to several tens of kHz.\n  In the horizontal architecture of FlashCam, the photon detector plane (PDP),\nconsisting of photon detectors, preamplifiers, high voltage-, control-, and\nmonitoring systems, is a self-contained unit, which is interfaced through\nanalogue signal transmission to the digital readout system. The horizontal\nintegration of FlashCam is expected not only to be more cost efficient, it also\nallows PDPs with different types of photon detectors to be adapted to the\nFlashCam readout system. This paper describes the FlashCam concept, its\nverification process, and its implementation for a 12 m class CTA telescope\nwith PMT-based PDP.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Jul 2013 20:53:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-15"}

The 30Dor-10 cloud north of R136 was mapped in 12CO 2-1, 13CO 2-1, C18O\n2-1, 1.3mm continuum, the H30alpha recombination line, and two H2CO 3-2\ntransitions. Most 12CO emission is associated with small filaments and clumps\n(<1pc, ~1000 Msun at the current resolution). Some clumps are associated with\nprotostars, including \"pillars of creation\" photoablated by intense radiation\nfrom R136. Emission from molecular clouds is often analyzed by decomposition\ninto approximately beam-sized clumps. Such clumps in 30 Doradus follow similar\ntrends in size, linewidth, and surface density to Milky Way clumps. The 30\nDoradus clumps have somewhat larger linewidths for a given size than predicted\nby Larson's scaling relation, consistent with pressure confinement. They extend\nto higher surface density at a given size and linewidth compared to clouds\nstudied at 10pc resolution. These trends are also true of clumps in Galactic\ninfrared-dark clouds; higher resolution observations of both environments are\nrequired. Consistency of clump masses calculated from dust continuum, CO, and\nthe virial theorem reveals that the CO abundance in 30 Doradus clumps is not\nsignificantly different from the LMC mean, but the dust abundance may be\nreduced by ~2. There are no strong trends in clump properties with distance\nfrom R136; dense clumps are not strongly affected by the external radiation\nfield, but there is a modest trend towards lower dense clump filling fraction\ndeeper in the cloud.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Jul 2013 21:28:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

While this may be true at\nhigh redshifts, at lower redshifts and for the most massive black holes mergers\nthemselves might add significantly to the mass budget. We evolve SMBHs from $4\n> z > 0$ using merger trees derived from hydrodynamical cosmological\nsimulations of a cluster and void region, scaled to the observed value of the\nstellar mass fraction to account for overcooling. Mass gains from gas accretion\nproportional to bulge growth and BH-BH mergers are tracked, as are black holes\nthat remain \"orbiting\" due to insufficient dynamical friction in a merger\nremnant, as well as those that are ejected due to gravitational recoil. We find\nthat gas accretion remains the dominant source of mass accumulation in almost\nall SMBHs; mergers contribute $2.5\\pm0.1\\%$ for all SMBHs in the cluster and\n$1.0\\pm0.1\\%$ in the void since $z = 4$. However, mergers are significant for\nmassive SMBHs. The fraction of mass accumulated from mergers for central BHs\ngenerally increases for larger values of the host bulge mass: in the void, the\nfraction is $2\\%$ at $M_{*, bul} = 10^{10} M_{\\odot}$, increasing to $4\\%$ at\n$M_{*, bul} \\gtrsim 10^{11} M_{\\odot}$, and in the cluster it is $4\\%$ at\n$M_{*, bul} = 10^{10} M_{\\odot}$ and $23\\%$ at $10^{12} M_{\\odot}$. We find\nthat $40\\%$ of SMBHs and $\\approx 8\\%$ of the total SMBH mass is found orbiting\nin the cluster region at $z = 0$. The existence of orbiting and ejected SMBHs\nrequires modification of the Soltan argument. We estimate this correction to\nthe integrated accreted mass density of SMBHs to be in the range $6-21\\%$, with\na mean value of $11\\pm3\\%$.

In the proposed downlink framework, every active user\nreports the post-processing signal-to-interference-plus-noise-power-ratio\n(post-SINR) or the receiver specific mutual information (MI) to its own\ntransmitter using a feedback channel. The combination of scheduling and\nmulti-antenna receiver processing leads to substantial interference suppression\ngain. Specifically, we show that opportunistic scheduling exploits spatial\ninterference alignment (SIA) property inherent to a multi-user system for\neffective interference mitigation. We obtain bounds for the outage probability\nand the sum outage capacity for single stream and multi stream SM employing\nreal or complex encoding for a symmetric interference channel model.\n  The techniques considered in this paper are optimal in different operating\nregimes.

This reflection essentially occurs where the\nlocal wavelength becomes comparable to the pressure scale height. In close\nbinary stars, the sound speed is a constant on equipotentials, while the\npressure scale height, which depends on the local effective gravity, varies on\nequipotentials and may be much greater near the inner Lagrangian point (L_1).\nAs a result, waves reaching the vicinity of L_1 may propagate unimpeded into\nlow density regions, where they tend to dissipate quickly due to non-linear and\nradiative effects.

In such a system, the reading of a sensor\nrepresents measures of a physical quantity, and sensor values are often reals\nranged over bounded intervals. The implementation of control laws is based on\nnonlinear numerical computations over the received sensor values. Synthesizing\ncontrollers fulfilling features within CPS brings a huge challenge to the\nresearch community in formal methods, as most of the works in automatic\ncontroller synthesis (LTL synthesis) are restricted to specifications having a\nfew discrete inputs within the Boolean domain.\n  In this report, we present a novel approach that addresses the above\nchallenge to synthesize controllers for CPS. Our core methodology, called\nnumerical LTL synthesis, extends LTL synthesis by using inputs or outputs in\nreal numbers and by allowing predicates of polynomial constraints to be defined\nwithin an LTL formula as specification. The synthesis algorithm is based on an\ninterplay between an LTL synthesis engine which handles the pseudo-Boolean\nstructure, together with a nonlinear constraint validity checker which tests\nthe (in)feasibility of a (counter-)strategy. The methodology is integrated\nwithin the CPS research framework Ptolemy II via the development of an LTL\nsynthesis module G4LTL and a validity checker JBernstein. Although we only\ntarget the theory of nonlinear real arithmetic, the use of pseudo-Boolean\nsynthesis framework also allows an easy extension to embed a richer set of\ntheories, making the technique applicable to a much broader audience.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Jul 2013 10:49:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-16"}

Galaxy clusters are the last and largest objects to form in the\nstandard hierarchical structure formation scenario through merging of smaller\nsystems. The substructure frequency in the past and present epoch provides\nexcellent means for studying the underlying cosmological model. Aims. Using\nX-ray observations, we study the substructure frequency as a function of\nredshift by quantifying and comparing the fraction of dynamically young\nclusters at different redshifts up to z=1.08. We are especially interested in\npossible biases due to the inconsistent data quality of the low-z and high-z\nsamples. Methods. Two well-studied morphology estimators, power ratio P3/P0 and\ncenter shift w, were used to quantify the dynamical state of 129 galaxy\nclusters, taking into account the different observational depth and noise\nlevels of the observations. Results. Owing to the sensitivity of P3/P0 to\nPoisson noise, it is essential to use datasets with similar photon statistics\nwhen studying the P3/P0-z relation. We degraded the high-quality data of the\nlow-redshift sample to the low data quality of the high-z observations and\nfound a shallow positive slope that is, however, not significant, indicating a\nslightly larger fraction of dynamically young objects at higher redshift. The\nw-z relation shows no significant dependence on the data quality and gives a\nsimilar result. Conclusions. We find a similar trend for P3/P0 and w, namely a\nvery mild increase of the disturbed cluster fraction with increasing redshifts.\nWithin the significance limits, our findings are also consistent with no\nevolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Jul 2013 13:08:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-24"}

The gambler's goal is to obtain a constant\nfraction of the expected reward that the optimal offline algorithm would get.\nRecently, prophet inequalities have been generalized to settings where the\ngambler can choose $k$ items, and, more generally, where he can choose any\nindependent set in a matroid. However, all the existing algorithms require the\ngambler to know the distribution from which the rewards $V_1,...,V_n$ are\ndrawn.\n  The assumption that the gambler knows the distribution from which\n$V_1,...,V_n$ are drawn is very strong. Instead, we work with the much simpler\nassumption that the gambler only knows a few samples from this distribution. We\nconstruct the first single-sample prophet inequalities for many settings of\ninterest, whose guarantees all match the best possible asymptotically,\n\\emph{even with full knowledge of the distribution}. Specifically, we provide a\nnovel single-sample algorithm when the gambler can choose any $k$ elements\nwhose analysis is based on random walks with limited correlation. In addition,\nwe provide a black-box method for converting specific types of solutions to the\nrelated \\emph{secretary problem} to single-sample prophet inequalities, and\napply it to several existing algorithms. Finally, we provide a constant-sample\nprophet inequality for constant-degree bipartite matchings.\n  We apply these results to design the first posted-price and multi-dimensional\nauction mechanisms with limited information in settings with asymmetric\nbidders.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Jul 2013 13:26:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-16"}
