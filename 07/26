When applied to still more specialized\npublication sets at the level of individual scientists, also a more accurate\ndelimitation is required of the reference domain that provides the expectations\nto which a performance is compared. This necessity for sharper accuracy\nchallenges standard methodology based on predefined subject categories. This\npaper proposes a way to define a reference domain that is more strongly\ndelimited than in standard methodology, by building it up out of cells of the\npartition created by the pre-defined subject categories and their\nintersections. This partition approach can be applied to different existing\nfield normalization variants. The resulting reference domain lies between those\ngenerated by standard field normalization and journal normalization. Examples\nbased on fictive and real publication records illustrate how the potential\nimpact on results can exceed or be smaller than the effect of other currently\ndebated normalization variants, depending on the case studied. The proposed\nPartition-based Field Normalization is expected to offer advantages in\nparticular at the level of individual scientists and other very specific\npublication records, such as publication output from interdisciplinary\nresearch.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Jul 2013 16:22:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-26"}

Our\nmeasurements of $R_s$ combined with the temperature mapping and laser scanning\nof a 2.36 mm thick Nb plate incorporated into a 3.3 GHz Nb resonator cavity\ncooled by the superfluid He at 2 K, revealed spatial scales and temperature\ndistributions of hotspots and showed that they can be moved or split by thermal\ngradients produced by the scanning laser beam. These results, along with the\nobserved hysteretic field dependence of $R_s$ which can be tuned by the\nscanning laser beam, show that the hotspots in our Nb sample are due to trapped\nvortex bundles which contain $\\sim 10^6$ vortices spread over regions $\\sim\n0.1-1$ cm.

As a\nresult, reactive flow solvers with detailed chemistry often become intractable\neven for large clusters of CPUs, especially when dealing with direct numerical\nsimulation (DNS) of turbulent combustion problems. This has motivated the\ndevelopment of several techniques for reducing the complexity of such kinetics\nmodels, where eventually only a few variables are considered in the development\nof the simplified model. Unfortunately, no generally applicable a priori recipe\nfor selecting suitable parameterizations of the reduced model is available, and\nthe choice of slow variables often relies upon intuition and experience. We\npresent an automated approach to this task, consisting of three main steps.\nFirst, the low dimensional manifold of slow motions is (approximately) sampled\nby brief simulations of the detailed model, starting from a rich enough\nensemble of admissible initial conditions. Second, a global parameterization of\nthe manifold is obtained through the Diffusion Map (DMAP) approach, which has\nrecently emerged as a powerful tool in data analysis/machine learning. Finally,\na simplified model is constructed and solved on the fly in terms of the above\nreduced (slow) variables. Clearly, closing this latter model requires\nnontrivial interpolation calculations, enabling restriction (mapping from the\nfull ambient space to the reduced one) and lifting (mapping from the reduced\nspace to the ambient one). This is a key step in our approach, and a variety of\ninterpolation schemes are reported and compared.

This interaction results in moderate heating of\nthe gas due to the recoil of the atoms upon scattering, which is of great\ninterest for future studies of the pre-reionization IGM in the HI 21 cm line.\nWe investigate the effect of this Ly-alpha heating in the IGM with linear\ndensity, temperature, and velocity perturbations.

To\nfind the relevant length scale and the extent to which Ly-alpha heating affects\nperturbations, we calculate the gas heating rates by numerically solving\nlinearized Boltzmann equations in which scattering is treated by the\nFokker-Planck approximation.

In order to optimize the compression, trajectory compression\nalgorithms need to adapt compression ratio subject to the compressibility of\nthe trajectory. Intuitively, the trajectory of an object moving in starlight\nroad is more compressible compared to the trajectory of a object moving in\nwinding roads, therefore, higher compression is achievable in the former case\ncompared to the later. We propose an in-situ compression technique underpinning\nthe support vector regression theory, which accurately predicts the\ncompressibility of a trajectory given the mean speed of the object and then\napply compressive sensing to adapt the compression to the compressibility of\nthe trajectory. The conventional encoding and decoding process of compressive\nsensing uses predefined dictionary and measurement (or projection) matrix\npairs. However, the selection of an optimal pair is nontrivial and exhaustive,\nand random selection of a pair does not guarantee the best compression\nperformance. In this paper, we propose a deterministic and data driven\nconstruction for the projection matrix which is obtained by applying singular\nvalue decomposition to a sparsifying dictionary learned from the dataset. We\nanalyze case studies of pedestrian and animal trajectory datasets including GPS\ntrajectory data from 127 subjects. The experimental results suggest that the\nproposed adaptive compression algorithm, incorporating the deterministic\nconstruction of projection matrix, offers significantly better compression\nperformance compared to the state-of-the-art alternatives.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Jul 2013 04:59:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-29"}

This is helpful to\nunderstand the truncation mechanism which is used to obtain a unitary conformal\nfield theory dual to linearized polycritical gravity. It turns out that the\ntruncation mechanism is nothing but a general quartet mechanism appeared when\nintroducing the FP ghost action.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Jul 2013 06:41:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 12 Oct 2013 06:08:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-30"}

Due to the non-linear nature of\nthe coupling between the A/B and BCP/solvent concentrations, the A/B modulation\ninduces modulations in the polymer-solvent relative concentration with a double\nwavenumber. The free boundary separating the polymer-rich phase from the\nsolvent-rich one is studied in two situations. First, we show how the presence\nof a chemically patterned substrate leads to deformations of the BCP\nfilm/solvent interface, creation of terraces in lamellar BCP film and even\nformation of multi-domain droplets as induced by the patterned substrate. Our\nresults are in agreement with previous self-consistent field theory\ncalculations. Second, we compare the surface tension between parallel lamellae\ncoexisting with a solvent phase with that of a perpendicular one, and show that\nthe surface tension has a non-monotonic dependence on temperature. The\nanisotropic surface tension can lead to deformation of spherical BCP droplets\ninto lens-shaped ones, together with re-orientation of the lamellae inside the\ndroplet during the polymer/solvent phase separation process in agreement with\nexperiment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Jul 2013 08:21:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 22 Dec 2013 17:47:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-22"}

In the\nstabilizer formalism, which is widely used in QECC, generators $G_i (i=1,2,..)$\nconsist of multiples of Pauli matrices and perform encoding, decoding and\nmeasurement. In order to maintain encoding states, the stabilizer Hamiltonian\n$H_{\\rm stab}=-\\sum_i G_i$ is suitable because its ground state corresponds to\nthe code space. On the other hand, Hamiltonians of most solid-state qubits have\ntwo-body interactions and show their own dynamics. In addition solid-state\nqubits are fixed on substrate and qubit-qubit operation is restricted in their\nneighborhood. The main purpose of this paper is to show how to directly\ngenerate the stabilizer Hamiltonian $H_{\\rm stab}$ from conventional two-body\nHamiltonians with Ising interaction and XY interaction by applying a pulse\ncontrol method such as an NMR technique. We show that generation times of\n$H_{\\rm stab}$ for nine-qubit code, five-qubit code and Steane code are\nestimated to be less than 300 ns when typical experimental data of\nsuperconducting qubits are used, and sufficient pulse control is assumed.

Interaction between\nwaves and null points has been implicated as a possible mechanism for localised\nheating events. Aims: Here we investigate the transient behaviour of the Alfven\nwave about fully 3D proper and improper 3D magnetic null points. Previously,\nthe behaviour of fast magnetoacoustic waves at null points in 3D, cold MHD was\nconsidered by Thurgood & McLaughlin (Astronomy & Astrophysics, 2012, 545, A9).\nMethods: We introduce an Alfven wave into the vicinity of both proper and\nimproper null points by numerically solving the ideal, $\\beta=0$ MHD equations\nusing the LARE3D code. A magnetic fieldline and flux-based coordinate system\npermits the isolation of resulting wave-modes and the analysis of their\ninteraction. Results: We find that the Alfven wave propagates throughout the\nregion and accumulates near the fan-plane, causing current build up. For\ndifferent values of null point eccentricity, the qualitative behaviour changes\nonly by the imposition of anisotropic pulse dilation, due to the differing\nrates at which fieldlines diverge from the spine. For all eccentricities, we\nfind that the fast and Alfven waves are linearly decoupled. During the driving\nphase, an independently propagating fast wave is nonlinearly generated due to\nthe ponderomotive force. Subsequently, no further excitation of fast waves\noccurs. Conclusions: We find that the key aspects of the theory of Alfv\\'en\nwaves about 2D null points extends intuitively to the fully 3D case; i.e. the\nwave propagates along fieldlines and thus accumulates at predictable parts of\nthe topology. We also highlight that unlike in the 2D case, in 3D Alfven-wave\npulses are always toroidal and thus any aspects of 2D Alfven-wave-null models\nthat are pulse-geometry specific must be reconsidered in 3D.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Jul 2013 11:36:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

In order\nto accomplish these applications, ignorance of the limitations of acoustic\ncommunications such as high delay and low bandwidth is not feasible. In this\npaper, we propose Adaptive mobility of Courier nodes in Threshold-optimized\nDepth-based routing (AMCTD), exploring the proficient amendments in depth\nthreshold and implementing the optimal weight function to achieve longer\nnetwork lifetime. We segregate our scheme in 3 major phases of weight updating,\ndepth threshold variation and adaptive mobility of courier nodes.

Our construction is sufficiently general to encompass the\nalgebra of pseudo-differential operators of order zero on smooth manifolds,\nelliptic pseudo-differential operators of order zero, their abstract symbol\n(see Introduction \\S 2.) and their local $K$- theory analytical and topological\nindex classes, see \\cite{Teleman_arXiv_III}, \\S 5, Definition 5 and 6. Our\ndefinitions are sufficiently general to apply to exact sequences of singular\nintegral operators, which are of interest in the case of the index theorem on\nLipschitz and quasi-conformal manifolds, see \\cite{Teleman_IHES},\n\\cite{Teleman_Acta}, \\cite{Donaldson_Sullivan}, \\cite{Connes_Sullivan_Teleman}.\nIn this article we introduce localised algebras (Definition 3) $\\mathit{A}$ and\nin \\S 6 we define their local algebraic $K$-theory. A localised algebra\n$\\mathit{A}$ is an algebra in which a decreasing filtration by vector\nsub-spaces $\\mathit{A}_{\\mu}$ is introduced. The filtration $\\mathit{A}_{\\mu}$\ninduces a filtration on the space of matrices $\\mathbb{M}(\\mathit{A}_{\\mu})$.\nAlthough we define solely $K^{loc}_{\\ast}(\\mathit{A})$ for $\\ast= 0, \\; 1$, we\nexpect our construction could be extended in higher degrees. We stress that our\nconstruction of $K^{loc}_{0}(\\mathit{A})$ uses exclusively idempotent matrices\nand that the use of finite projective modules is totally avoided. (Idempotent\nmatrices, rather than projective modules, contain less arbitrariness in the\ndescription of the $K_{0}$ classes and allow a better filtration control). The\ngroup $K^{loc}_{0}(\\mathit{A})$ is by definition the quotient space of the\nspace of the Grothendieck completion of the space of idempotent matrices\nthrough three equivalence relations: -i) stabilisation $\\sim_{s}$, -2) local\nconjugation $\\sim_{l}$, {\\em and} -3) projective limit with respect to the\nfiltration. By definition, the $K_{1}^{loc} (\\mathit{A})$ is the projective\nlimit of the local $K_{1}(\\mathit{A}_{\\mu})$ groups. The group\n$K_{1}(\\mathit{A}_{\\mu})$ is by definition the quotient of\n$\\mathbb{GL}(\\mathit{A}_{\\mu})$ modulo the equivalence relation generated by:\n-1) stabilisation $\\sim_{s}$, --2) local conjugation $\\sim_{l}$ and -3)\n$\\sim_{\\mathbb{O}(\\mathit{A}_{\\mu})}$, where $\\mathbb{O}(\\mathit{A}_{\\mu})$ is\nthe sub-module generated by elements of the form $ u \\oplus u^{-1} $, for any\n$u \\in \\mathbb{GL}(\\mathit{A}_{\\mu})$. The class of any invertible element $u$\nmodulo conjugation (inner auto-morphisms) we call the Jordan canonical form of\n$u$. The local conjugation preserves the local Jordan canonical form of\ninvertible elements. The equivalence relation\n$\\sim_{\\mathbb{O}(\\mathit{A}_{\\mu})}$ insures existence of opposite elements in\n$K_{1}(\\mathit{A}_{\\mu})$ and $K_{1}^{loc}(\\mathit{A})$. Our definition of\n$K^{loc}_{1}(\\mathit{A})$ does not use the commutator sub-group\n$[\\mathbb{GL}(\\mathit{A}), \\mathbb{GL}(\\mathit{A})]$ nor elementary matrices in\nits construction. We define short exact sequences of localised algebras. To get\nthe corresponding (open) six terms exact sequence (Theorem 51) one has to take\nthe tensor product of the expected six terms exact sequence by\n$\\mathbb{Z}[\\frac{1}{2}]$. We expect the factor\n$\\otimes_{\\mathbb{Z}[\\frac{1}{2}}]$ to have important consequences. Our work\nshows that the basic structure of $K_{1}$ resides in the {\\em additive}\nsub-group generated by elements of the form $u \\oplus u^{-1}$, $u \\in\n\\mathbb{GL}(\\mathit{A})$, rather than in the {\\em multiplicativ} commutator\nsub-group $[\\mathbb{GL}(\\mathit{A}), \\mathbb{GL}(\\mathit{A})]$. Even into the\ncase of trivially filtered algebras, $\\mathit{A}_{\\mu} = \\mathit{A}$, for all\n$\\mu \\in \\mathbb{N}$, the introduced group $K^{loc}_{1}(\\mathit{A})$ should\nprovide more information than the classical group $K_{1}(\\mathit{A})$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Jul 2013 12:21:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 29 Jul 2013 14:59:48 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 28 Aug 2013 06:17:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-29"}

Stellar temperatures and\nradii are determined by fitting model spectra to spatially resolved broad-band\nphotometric energy distributions for stars in the sample.

These oscillations are of great interest as they\nprobably provide our first ever view of the normal modes of oscillation of\nneutron stars. The state-of-the-art lies in the study of the oscillations of\nelastic-magnetic stellar models, mainly with a view to relating the observed\nfrequencies to the structure and composition of the star itself. We advance\nthis programme by considering several new physical mechanisms that are likely\nto be important for magnetar oscillations. These relate to the\nsuperfluid/superconducting nature of the stellar interior, and the damping of\nthe modes, both through internal dissipation mechanisms and the launching of\nwaves into the magnetosphere. We make simple order-of-magnitude estimates to\nshow that both the frequencies and the damping time of magnetar oscillations\ncan evolve in time, identifying three distinct `pathways' that can be followed,\ndepending upon the initial magnitude of the mode excitation. These results are\ninteresting as they show that the information buried in magnetar QPOs may be\neven richer than previously thought, and motivate more careful examination of\nmagnetar light curves, to search for signatures of the different types of\nevolution that we have identified.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Jul 2013 15:47:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Feb 2014 10:26:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

In this approach the fundamental symmetry of\nstring theory contains phase space diffeomorphism invariance and the underlying\nstring geometry should be understood in terms of dynamical bi-Lagrangian\nmanifolds and an apparently new geometric structure, somewhat reminiscent of\npara-quaternionic geometry, which we call Born geometry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Jul 2013 15:49:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

However, typical setups do not take into account the effects\nof relativity on quantum properties. To include and exploit these effects, we\nintroduce techniques for the application of metrology to quantum field theory.\nQuantum field theory properly incorporates quantum theory and relativity, in\nparticular, at regimes where space-based experiments take place. This framework\nallows for high precision estimation of parameters that appear in quantum field\ntheory including proper times and accelerations.

The mathematical form of this empirical law comprises three\nfitting parameters whose values tend to be elusive, especially in\ninter-organizational studies. To allow interpretation of these parameters and\nbetter understand such distribution behavior, we present a statistical\nmechanical approach based on an analogy between the classical particles of a\nstatistical mechanical organization and the number of distinct words in a\ntextual organization. With this derivation, we achieve a transformed\n(generalized) form of the MA model, termed the statistical mechanical\nMenzerath-Altmann (SMMA) model. This novel transformed model consists of four\nparameters, one of which is a structure-dependent input parameter, and three of\nwhich are free-fitting parameters. Using distinct word data sets from two text\ncorpora, we verified that the SMMA model describes the same distribution as the\nMA model. We propose that the additional structure-dependent parameter of the\nSMMA model converts the three fitting parameters into structure-independent\nparameters. Moreover, the parameters of the SMMA model are associated with a\ncorresponding physical interpretation that can lead to characterization of an\norganization' s thermodynamic properties. We also propose that many\norganizations presenting MA law behavior, whether linguistic or not, can be\nexamined by the SMMA distribution model through the properly defined structural\ndegeneracy parameter and the energy associated states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Jul 2013 11:12:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

Citizens' transactional interactions (electronic transactions or\ne-transactions) with the government via the Internet are examined. Multiple\nmodels and theories in extant literature were referred to in identifying the\nresearch context requirements that enabled the analysis of e-transaction\nacceptance. A new research model that fits the research context was developed\nto predict and explain how acceptance is affected. A sample of 671 Saudi\ncitizens was recruited using an online survey. Structural equation modelling\nwas used to assess the impact on intention to use e-transactions. Preference\nfor using e-transactions as a communication method, perceptions of the\ncompatibility of e-transactions with values and citizens' needs,\ncommunicability of the results of using e-transactions, trust in the Internet\nas a medium of communication with the government, and conservation values are\npositive significant determinants of e-transaction acceptance. Conversely, the\ninfluence of trust in government agencies and motivation towards gaining\nprestige and possessing dominance over people and resources was negative. The\nfindings of this study include design and implementation strategies that can\nserve as guidance for the Saudi government, as well as for the developers and\nimplementers of e-transactions in the KSA.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Jul 2013 15:20:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 23 May 2014 06:39:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-26"}
