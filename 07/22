A remarkable feature of Fourier-Dedekind sums is that they\nsatisfy a reciprocity law called Rademacher reciprocity. In this paper, we\nstudy several aspects of Fourier-Dedekind sums: properties of general\nFourier-Dedekind sums, extensions of the reciprocity law, average behavior of\nFourier-Dedekind sums, and finally, extrema of 2-dimensional Fourier-Dedekind\nsums.\n  On properties of general Fourier-Dedekind sums we show that a general\nFourier-Dedekind sum is simultaneously a convolution of simpler\nFourier-Dedekind sums, and a linear combination of these with integer\ncoefficients. We show that Fourier-Dedekind sums can be extended naturally to a\ngroup under convolution.

This raises the question whether some sub-DLAs may harbor\nactive galactic nuclei (AGN) since supersolar metallicities are observed in\nAGN. Here we investigate this question based on a mini-survey of 21 quasars\nknown to contain sub-DLAs in their spectra. The X-ray observations were\nperformed with the Chandra X-ray Observatory. In cases of no detection we\nestimated upper limits of the X-ray luminosities of possible AGNs at the\nredshifts of the sub-DLAs. In six cases we find possible X-ray emission within\n~ 1 arcsec of the background quasar consistent with the presence of a nearby\nX-ray source. If these nearby X-ray sources are at the redshifts of the\nsub-DLAs, their estimated 0.2-10 keV luminosities range between 0.8 x\n10^{44}h^{-2} and 4.2 x 10^{44}h^{-2} erg s^{-1}, thus ruling out a normal\nlate-type galaxy origin, and suggesting that the emission originates in a\ngalactic nucleus near the center of a protogalaxy. The projected distances of\nthese possible nearby X-ray sources from the background quasars lie in the\nrange of 3-7 h^{-1} kpc, consistent with our hypothesis that they represent\nAGNs centered on the sub-DLAs.

We illustrate the case of the topological influence\nof a half-quantum vortex on the sign change of a point defect and point out\nthat the topological back-action from the point defect is such twisting of the\nvortex that the total twist of the vortex line carries the change in the\npoint-defect charge to conserve the total charge. We use this theory to\nclassify charge transfers in condensed matter systems and show that a\nnon-Abelian charge transfer can be realized in a spin-2 Bose-Einstein\ncondensate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Jul 2013 00:43:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Mar 2014 02:51:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-14"}

However, most of\nthe developed algorithms lack the ability to handle multiple classes, which\narguably a common application. Here, we propose an extension to an existing\nregularization algorithm called Threshold Gradient Descent Regularization\n(TGDR) to specifically tackle multi-class classification of microarray data.\nWhen there are several microarray experiments addressing the same/similar\nobjectives, one option is to use meta-analysis version of TGDR (Meta-TGDR),\nwhich considers the classification task as combination of classifiers with the\nsame structure/model while allowing the parameters to vary across studies.\nHowever, the original Meta-TGDR extension did not offer a solution to the\nprediction on independent samples. Here, we propose an explicit method to\nestimate the overall coefficients of the biomarkers selected by Meta-TGDR. This\nextension permits broader applicability and allows a comparison between the\npredictive performance of Meta-TGDR and TGDR using an independent testing set.\n  Results\n  Using real-world applications, we demonstrated the proposed multi-TGDR\nframework works well and the number of selected genes is less than the sum of\nall individualized binary TGDRs. Additionally, Meta-TGDR and TGDR on the\nbatch-effect adjusted pooled data approximately provided same results. By\nadding Bagging procedure in each application, the stability and good predictive\nperformance are warranted.\n  Conclusions\n  Compared with Meta-TGDR, TGDR is less computing time intensive, and requires\nno samples of all classes in each study. On the adjusted data, it has\napproximate same predictive performance with Meta-TGDR.

Thereby, they might obstruct the detection of the weak astronomical\nsignals of interest. This issue is especially important for Epoch of\nReionisation (EoR) projects that try to detect the faint redshifted HI signals\nfrom the time of the earliest structures in the Universe. We explore the RFI\nsituation at 30-163 MHz by studying brightness histograms of visibility data\nobserved with LOFAR, similar to radio-source-count analyses that are used in\ncosmology. An empirical RFI distribution model is derived that allows the\nsimulation of RFI in radio observations. The brightness histograms show an RFI\ndistribution that follows a power-law distribution with an estimated exponent\naround -1.5. With several assumptions, this can be explained with a uniform\ndistribution of terrestrial radio sources whose radiation follows existing\npropagation models. Extrapolation of the power law implies that the current\nLOFAR EoR observations should be severely RFI limited if the strength of RFI\nsources remains strong after time integration. This is in contrast with actual\nobservations, which almost reach the thermal noise and are thought not to be\nlimited by RFI. Therefore, we conclude that it is unlikely that there are\nundetected RFI sources that will become visible in long observations.\nConsequently, there is no indication that RFI will prevent an EoR detection\nwith LOFAR.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Jul 2013 01:51:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-22"}

This\nmethod is very advantageous in that it requires neither eclipses, nor an\nexperimental calibration. It is particularly suited for exploring the low\nmass-ratio end of the evolution of cataclysmic variables, where the secondary\nis undetectable by conventional methods.

Here, firstly a new and a novel equation named as the Omega\nEquation that describes the shape of human head-shoulder is developed and based\non this equation, a classifier is designed particularly for detecting human\npresence in a scene. The classifier detects human by analyzing some of the\ndiscriminative features of the values of the parameters obtained from the Omega\nequation.

The\nmost prominent trait of collective behaviour is the emergence of global order:\nindividuals synchronize their states, giving the stunning impression that the\ngroup behaves as one. In many biological systems, though, it is unclear whether\nglobal order is present. A paradigmatic case is that of insect swarms, whose\nerratic movements seem to suggest that group formation is a mere epiphenomenon\nof the independent interaction of each individual with an external landmark. In\nthese cases, whether or not the group behaves truly collectively is debated.\nHere, we experimentally study swarms of midges in the field and measure how\nmuch the change of direction of one midge affects that of other individuals. We\ndiscover that, despite the lack of collective order, swarms display very strong\ncorrelations, totally incompatible with models of noninteracting particles. We\nfind that correlation increases sharply with the swarm's density, indicating\nthat the interaction between midges is based on a metric perception mechanism.\nBy means of numerical simulations we demonstrate that such growing correlation\nis typical of a system close to an ordering transition.

In this thesis, variational integrators are developed\nfor several important models of plasma physics: guiding centre dynamics\n(particle dynamics), the Vlasov-Poisson system (kinetic theory), and ideal\nmagnetohydrodynamics (plasma fluid theory). Special attention is given to\nphysical conservation laws like conservation of energy and momentum.\n  Most systems in plasma physics do not possess a Lagrangian formulation to\nwhich the variational integrator methodology is directly applicable. Therefore\nthe theory is extended towards nonvariational differential equations by linking\nit to Ibragimov's theory of integrating factors and adjoint equations. It\nallows us to find a Lagrangian for all ordinary and partial differential\nequations and systems thereof. Consequently, the applicability of variational\nintegrators is extended to a much larger family of systems than envisaged in\nthe original theory. This approach allows for the application of Noether's\ntheorem to analyse the conservation properties of the system, both at the\ncontinuous and the discrete level.\n  In numerical examples, the conservation properties of the derived schemes are\nanalysed. In case of guiding centre dynamics, momentum in the toroidal\ndirection of a tokamak is preserved exactly. The particle energy exhibits an\nerror, but the absolute value of this error stays constant during the entire\nsimulation. Therefore numerical dissipation is absent. In case of the kinetic\ntheory, the total number of particles, total linear momentum and total energy\nare preserved exactly, i.e., up to machine accuracy.

However, there are reasons why the number\nof mementos in a TimeMap would decrease, for example: archival redaction of\nsome or all of the mementos, archival restructuring, and transient errors on\nthe part of one or more archives. We study TimeMaps for 4,000 original\nresources over a three month period, note their change patterns, and develop a\ncaching algorithm for TimeMaps suitable for a reverse proxy in front of a\nMemento aggregator. We show that TimeMap cardinality is constant or\nmonotonically increasing for 80.2% of all TimeMap downloads observed in the\nobservation period. The goal of the caching algorithm is to exploit the ideally\nmonotonically increasing nature of TimeMaps and not cache responses with fewer\nmementos than the already cached TimeMap. This new caching algorithm uses\nconditional cache replacement and a Time To Live (TTL) value to ensure the user\nhas access to the most complete TimeMap available. Based on our empirical data,\na TTL of 15 days will minimize the number of mementos missed by users, and\nminimize the load on archives contributing to TimeMaps.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Jul 2013 12:53:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-23"}

How\nthese adaptation currents change the relationship between in-vivo like\nfluctuating synaptic input, spike rate output and the spike train statistics,\nhowever, is not well understood. In this computational study we show that an\nadaptation current which primarily depends on the subthreshold membrane voltage\nchanges the neuronal input-output relationship (I-O curve) subtractively,\nthereby increasing the response threshold. A spike-dependent adaptation current\nalters the I-O curve divisively, thus reducing the response gain. Both types of\nadaptation currents naturally increase the mean inter-spike interval (ISI), but\nthey can affect ISI variability in opposite ways. A subthreshold current always\ncauses an increase of variability while a spike-triggered current decreases\nhigh variability caused by fluctuation-dominated inputs and increases low\nvariability when the average input is large. The effects on I-O curves match\nthose caused by synaptic inhibition in networks with asynchronous irregular\nactivity, for which we find subtractive and divisive changes caused by external\nand recurrent inhibition, respectively. Synaptic inhibition, however, always\nincreases the ISI variability. We analytically derive expressions for the I-O\ncurve and ISI variability, which demonstrate the robustness of our results.\nFurthermore, we show how the biophysical parameters of slow\n$\\mathrm{K}^+$-conductances contribute to the two different types of adaptation\ncurrents and find that $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-activated $\\mathrm{K}^+$-currents are\neffectively captured by a simple spike-dependent description, while\nmuscarine-sensitive or $\\mathrm{Na}^+$-activated $\\mathrm{K}^+$-currents show a\ndominant subthreshold component.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Jul 2013 14:24:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 Nov 2013 10:39:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-08"}

The main difference between them is that a CFL\napproach seeks optimal classification results without requiring any cost\ninformation, even in the class imbalance problem. In fact, several CFL\napproaches exist in the related studies, such as sampling and some\ncriteria-based pproaches. However, to our best knowledge, none of the existing\nCFL and CSL approaches are able to process the abstaining classifications\nproperly when no information is given about errors and rejects.

Significant features are observed from the new\nstrategy. While the degree of class imbalance is changing, the proposed\nstrategy is able to balance the errors and rejects accordingly and\nautomatically. Another advantage of the strategy is its ability of deriving\noptimal rejection thresholds for abstaining classifications and the\n\"equivalent\" costs in binary classifications.

Here we implement an\nab-initio Gutzwiller+LDA calculation, and apply it to a classic problem, the\nferromagnetism of bulk bcc Fe, whose nature has attracted recent interest. In\nthe conventional Stoner-Wohlfarth model, the ferromagnetic ordering of iron\nsets in so that the electrons can reduce their mutual Coulomb repulsion at the\nextra cost of some increase of electron kinetic energy. Density functional\ntheory within the spin polarized local density approximation (LDA) has long\nsupported that picture, showing that ferromagnetic alignment causes band\nnarrowing and a corresponding wavefunction localization, whence a kinetic\nenergy increase. However, because of its inadequate treatment of strong\nintra-site correlations for localized d orbitals, LDA cannot be relied upon,\nparticularly when it comes to separately describing fine potential and kinetic\nenergy imbalances. With ab-initio Gutzwiller+LDA, we indeed find that the\neffect of correlations is to dramatically reverse the balance, the\nferromagnetic ordering of Fe in fact causing a decrease of kinetic energy, at\nthe cost of some increase of potential energy. The underlying physical\nmechanism, foreshadowed long ago by Goodenough and others, and more recently\nsupported by LDA+DMFT calculations, is that correlations cause eg and t2g 3d\norbitals to behave very differently. Weakly dispersive eg states are\nspin-polarized and almost localized, while, more than half filled, the t2g are\nbroad band, fully delocalized states. Owing to intra-atomic Hund's rule\nexchange which aligns eg and t2g spins, the propagation of itinerant t2g holes\nis only allowed when different atomic spins are ferromagnetically aligned. We\nthus conclude that double exchange is at work already in the most popular\nferromagnetic metal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Jul 2013 15:05:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-23"}
