We consider a\nsetup in which a few sensors are mounted on a rigid body. The absolute position\nof the sensors on the rigid body, or the absolute position of the rigid body\nitself is not known. However, we know how the sensors are mounted on the rigid\nbody, i.e., the sensor topology is known. Using range-only measurements between\nthe sensors and a few anchors (nodes with known absolute positions), and\nwithout using any inertial measurements (e.g., accelerometers), we estimate the\nposition and orientation of the rigid body. For this purpose, the absolute\nposition of the sensors is expressed as an affine function of the Stiefel\nmanifold. In other words, we represent the orientation as a rotation matrix,\nand absolute position as a translation vector.

In both grades of polyetherimide, asymmetric Argand\nplots are observed, which are related to a sublinear power-law dependency\n($\\omega^{n}$ with $n<1$) in the real part of the conductivity.

In skeletal muscle, for\nexample, hundreds of myosin II molecules cooperate in thick filaments. In\nnon-muscle cells, by contrast, small groups with few tens of non-muscle myosin\nII motors contribute to essential cellular processes such as transport, shape\nchanges or mechanosensing. Here we introduce a detailed and analytically\ntractable model for this important situation. Using a three-state crossbridge\nmodel for the myosin II motor cycle and exploiting the assumptions of fast\npower stroke kinetics and equal load sharing between motors in equivalent\nstates, we reduce the stochastic reaction network to a one-step master equation\nfor the binding and unbinding dynamics (parallel cluster model) and derive the\nrules for ensemble movement. We find that for constant external load, ensemble\ndynamics is strongly shaped by the catch bond character of myosin II, which\nleads to an increase of the fraction of bound motors under load and thus to\nfirm attachment even for small ensembles. This adaptation to load results in a\nconcave force-velocity relation described by a Hill relation. For external load\nprovided by a linear spring, myosin II ensembles dynamically adjust themselves\ntowards an isometric state with constant average position and load. The\ndynamics of the ensembles is now determined mainly by the distribution of\nmotors over the different kinds of bound states.

Group\nminimax, also known as Gamma-minimax, is a robust intermediary between Bayesian\nand minimax hypothesis testing that allows for coarse or partial advance\nknowledge of the hypothesis priors by using information on sets in which the\nprior lies. Existing work on group minimax, however, does not consider the\nquestion of how to define the sets or groups of priors; it is assumed that the\ngroups are given. In this work, we propose a novel intermediate detection\nscheme formulated through the quantization of the space of prior probabilities\nthat optimally determines groups and also representative priors within the\ngroups. We show that when viewed from a quantization perspective, group minimax\namounts to determining centroids with a minimax Bayes risk error divergence\ndistortion criterion: the appropriate Bregman divergence for this task.\nMoreover, the optimal partitioning of the space of prior probabilities is a\nBregman Voronoi diagram.

The previous results are consolidated and\nbenchmarked with turbulence generated by regular square-mesh grids, designed to\nretain certain geometrical parameters of the fractal square grid. This\ncomparison shows that the nonequilibrium behaviour is manifested in both\nfractal square grid- and regular square-mesh grid-generated turbulence for a\ndownstream region during the turbulence decay up to the first few multiples of\nthe wake interaction distance. For one of the regular grids it is shown that\nbeyond this region there is a transition to the classical dissipation behaviour\nif the local turbulent Reynolds number is sufficiently high. A sharp conclusion\ncan thus be drawn that this behaviour is more general than initially thought\nand therefore of much greater scientific and engineering significance. The\nnonequilibrium dissipation phenomena is further investigated by experimentally\nmeasuring the terms of an inhomogeneous von Karman-Howarth-Monin equation. This\nequation is essentially a scale-by-scale energy transfer budget. From the data\nit is shown that the inhomogeneity of the turbulent flow does not tamper with\nthe nonequilibrium phenomena and that the scaling of the nonlinear energy\ntransfer, i.e. the transfer of energy to the small-scales, is out of balance\nwith the dissipation. This imbalance leads to the growth of the small-scale\nadvection to compensate for the increasing gap between the energy transferred\nand the energy dissipated. For the highest Reynolds number data it is also\nshown that the nonequilibrium dissipation scaling appears to be consistent with\nthe expectation that it is asymptotically independent of the viscosity with a\npower-law spectra with the Kolmogorov-Obukhov exponent -5/3.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Jul 2013 18:37:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-25"}

To encourage honesty, PIs' chances\nfor getting funded are tied to the quality of their reviews (with respect to\nthe reviews provided by the entire group), in addition to the quality of their\nproposals. Intuitively, this approach can more fairly distribute the review\nworkload, discourage frivolous proposal submission, and encourage high quality\nreviews. On the other hand, this method has already raised concerns about the\nintegrity of the process and the possibility of strategic manipulation. In this\npaper, we take a closer look at three specific issues in an attempt to gain a\nbetter understanding of the strengths and limitations of the new process beyond\nfirst impressions and anecdotal evidence. We start by considering the benefits\nand drawbacks of bundling the quality of PIs' reviews with the scientific merit\nof their proposals.

We conclude that some benefits of using review quality as an\nincentive mechanism may outweigh its drawbacks. On the other hand, even a\ncoalition of two PIs can cause significant harm to the process, as the built-in\nincentives are not strong enough to deter collusion.

We detect what we argue to be the obscured active nucleus with an\neffective angular resolution of < 50 pc at z = 2.3 . The S_{1.7} = 210 micro-Jy\n(9-\\sigma) detection of this unresolved source is located within the HST\nrest-frame ultraviolet/optical arc, however, >~100 mas northward of the arc\ncentre of curvature. This leads to a source plane inversion that places the\nEuropean VLBI Network detection to within milli-arcseconds of the modelled cusp\ncaustic, resulting in a very large magnification (\\mu ~70), over an order of\nmagnitude larger than the CO (1-0) derived magnification of a spatially\nresolved JVLA map, using the same lens model. We estimate the quasar bolometric\nluminosity from a number of independent techniques and with our X-ray modelling\nfind evidence that the AGN may be close to Compton-thick, with an intrinsic\nbolometric luminosity log(L_{bol,QSO} / L_sun) = 11.34 +- 0.27 dex. We make the\nfirst black hole mass estimate of IRAS F10214+4724 and find log(M_{BH}/M_sun) =\n8.36 +- 0.56 which suggests a low black hole accretion rate (\\lambda = \\dot{M}\n/ \\dot{M}_{Edd} ~ 3\\pm^7_2 percent). We find evidence for a M_{BH}/M_{spheroid}\nratio that is 1-2 orders of magnitude larger than that of submillimetre\ngalaxies (SMGs) at z~2. At face value, this suggests IRAS F10214+4724 has\nundergone a different evolutionary path compared to SMGs at the same epoch. A\nprimary result of this work is the demonstration that emission regions of\ndiffering size and position can undergo significantly different magnification\nboosts (> 1 dex) and therefore distort our view of high-redshift,\ngravitationally lensed galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Jul 2013 20:02:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

It provides a global address space\npartitioned among the cluster nodes, and is supported in programming languages\nlike C, C++, and Fortran by means of APIs. In this paper we provide a formal\nmodel for the semantics of single instruction, multiple data programs using\nPGAS APIs. Our model reflects the main features of popular real-world APIs such\nas SHMEM, ARMCI, GASNet, GPI, and GASPI.\n  A key feature of PGAS is the support for one-sided communication: a node may\ndirectly read and write the memory located at a remote node, without explicit\nsynchronization with the processes running on the remote side. One-sided\ncommunication increases performance by decoupling process synchronization from\ndata transfer, but requires the programmer to reason about appropriate\nsynchronizations between reads and writes. As a second contribution, we propose\nand investigate robustness, a criterion for correct synchronization of PGAS\nprograms. Robustness corresponds to acyclicity of a suitable happens-before\nrelation defined on PGAS computations. The requirement is finer than the\nclassical data race freedom and rules out most false error reports.\n  Our main result is an algorithm for checking robustness of PGAS programs. The\nalgorithm makes use of two insights. Using combinatorial arguments we first\nshow that, if a PGAS program is not robust, then there are computations in a\ncertain normal form that violate happens-before acyclicity. Intuitively,\nnormal-form computations delay remote accesses in an ordered way. We then\ndevise an algorithm that checks for cyclic normal-form computations.\nEssentially, the algorithm is an emptiness check for a novel automaton model\nthat accepts normal-form computations in streaming fashion. Altogether, we\nprove the robustness problem is PSpace-complete.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Jul 2013 21:24:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-26"}

The shape of a $l^q$ estimator\ndiffers in varying choices of the regularization order $q$. In particular,\n$l^1$ leads to the LASSO estimate, while $l^{2}$ corresponds to the smooth\nridge regression. This makes the order $q$ a potential tuning parameter in\napplications.

In this paper we shall study a specific instance of Voloshin's\nidea: a non-monochromatic non-rainbow (NMNR) colouring of a hypergraph is a\ncolouring of its vertices such that every edge has at least two vertices\ncoloured with different colours (non-monochromatic) and no edge has all of its\nvertices coloured with distinct colours (non-rainbow). Perhaps the most\nintriguing phenomenon of such colourings is that a hypergraph can have gaps in\nits NMNR chromatic spectrum, that is, for some $k_1 < k_2 < k_3$, the\nhypergraph is NMNR colourable with $k_1$ and with $k_3$ colours but not with\n$k_2$ colours.\n  Several beautiful examples have been constructed of NMNR colourings of\nhypergraphs exhibiting phenomena not seen in classical colourings. Many of\nthese examples are either \\emph{ad hoc} or else are based on designs. The\nlatter are difficult to construct and they generally give uniform\n$r$-hypergraphs only for low values of $r$, generally $r=3$. In this paper we\nshall study the NMNR colourings of a type of $r$-uniform hypergraph which we\ncall $\\sigma$-hypergraphs. The attractive feature of these $\\sigma$-hypergraphs\nis that they are easy to define, even for large $r$, and that, by suitable\nmodifications of their parameters, they can give families of hypergraphs which\nare guaranteed to have NMNR spectra with gaps or NMNR spectra without gaps.\nThese $\\sigma$-hypergraphs also team up very well with the notion of\ncolour-bounded hypergraphs recently introduced by Bujt{\\'a}s and Tuza to give\nfurther control on the appearance of gaps and perhaps explain better the\nexistence of gaps in the colouring of mixed hypergraphs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Jul 2013 07:03:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-26"}

However, it is highly unstable since some cooperators\nmay contribute to a common project but refuse to punish defectors. Centralized\nsanctioning institutions (for example, tax-funded police and criminal courts)\ncan solve this problem by punishing both defectors and cooperators who refuse\nto punish. These institutions have been shown to emerge naturally through\nsocial learning and then displace all other forms of punishment, including peer\npunishment. However, this result provokes a number of questions. If centralized\nsanctioning is so successful, then why do many highly authoritarian states\nsuffer from low levels of cooperation? Why do states with high levels of public\ngood provision tend to rely more on citizen-driven peer punishment? And what\nhappens if centralized institutions can be circumvented by individual acts of\nbribery? Here, we consider how corruption influences the evolution of\ncooperation and punishment. Our model shows that the effectiveness of\ncentralized punishment in promoting cooperation breaks down when some actors in\nthe model are allowed to bribe centralized authorities. Counterintuitively,\nincreasing the sanctioning power of the central institution makes things even\nworse, since this prevents peer punishers from playing a role in maintaining\ncooperation. As a result, a weaker centralized authority is actually more\neffective because it allows peer punishment to restore cooperation in the\npresence of corruption. Our results provide an evolutionary rationale for why\npublic goods provision rarely flourishes in polities that rely only on strong\ncentralized institutions. Instead, cooperation requires both decentralized and\ncentralized enforcement. These results help to explain why citizen\nparticipation is a fundamental necessity for policing the commons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Jul 2013 07:32:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 1 Sep 2013 08:27:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-03"}

An unbinned\nmaximum likelihood ratio test was used to search for an excess of neutrinos\nabove the atmospheric background at any given direction in the sky.

In this paper, we discuss the\nasteroseismology work of DAV stars. The detailed period to period fitting\nmethod is fully discussed, including the reliability to detect the inner\nstructure of DAV stars. If we assume that all observed modes of some DAV star\nare the $l$ = 1 ones, the errors of model fitting will be always great. If we\nassume that the observed modes are composed of $l$ = 1 and 2 modes, the errors\nof model fitting will be small. However, there will be modes identified as $l$\n= 2 without quintuplets observed. G29-38 has been observed spectroscopically\nand photometrically for many years. Thompson et al. (2008) made $l$\nidentifications for the star through limb darkening effect. With eleven known\n$l$ modes, we also do the asteroseismology work for G29-38, which reduces the\nblind $l$ fittings and is a fair choice. Unfortunately, our two best-fitting\nmodels are not in line with the previous atmospheric results. Based on factors\nof only a few modes observed, stability and identification of eigenmodes,\nidentification of spherical degrees, construction of physical and realistic\nmodels and so on, detecting the inner structure of DAV stars by\nasteroseismology needs further development.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Jul 2013 08:55:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

Our analysis of the momentum transfer\ndistributions shows that an interplay of $J/\\psi$ production by low-energy\nphotons on the nucleus and by high-energy photons on the proton in proton-Pb\nUPCs can result in some excess of events at small $p_t$ in a definite region of\nthe rapidity y.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Jul 2013 10:29:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 7 Mar 2014 14:52:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

Early superhumps were recorded in both systems. During superoutburst\nplateau, ordinary superhumps with a period of 0.060291(4) d (MASTER J211258)\nand of 0.061307(9) d (MASTER J203749) in average were observed. MASTER J211258\nand MASTER J203749 exhibited eight and more than four post-superoutburst\nrebrightenings, respectively. In the final part of the superoutburst, an\nincrease in the superhump periods was seen in both systems. We have made a\nsurvey of WZ Sge-type dwarf novae with multiple rebrightenings, and confirmed\nthat the superhump periods of WZ Sge-type dwarf novae with multiple\nrebrightenings were longer than those of WZ Sge-type dwarf novae without a\nrebrightening. Although WZ Sge-type dwarf novae with multiple rebrightenings\nhave been thought to be the good candidates for period bouncers based on their\nlow mass ratio (q) from inferred from the period of fully grown (stage B)\nsuperhumps, our new method using the period of growing superhumps (stage A\nsuperhumps), however, implies higher q than those expected from stage B\nsuperhumps. These q values appear to be consistent with the duration of the\nstage A superoutbursts, which likely reflects the growth time of the 3:1\nresonance. We present a working hypothesis that the small fractional superhump\nexcesses for stage B superhumps in these systems may be explained as a result\nthat a higher gas pressure effect works in these systems than in ordinary SU\nUMa-type dwarf novae. This result leads to a new picture that WZ Sge-type dwarf\nnovae with multiple rebrightenings and SU UMa-type dwarf novae without a\nrebrightening (they are not period bouncers) are located in the same place on\nthe evolutionary track.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Jul 2013 12:20:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

In this context, we previously identified GJ 1214 as a\nhigh-priority target for a transit search, as the transit probability of a\nhabitable planet orbiting this nearby M4.5 dwarf would be significantly\nenhanced by the transiting nature of GJ 1214 b, the super-Earth already known\nto orbit the star.

The equation is identical with a\ntime-independent Schrodinger equation but incorporates elements of finance. The\nfinancial time-independent equation for option pricing is solved to explain a\nparticular explosive violent movement of stock price in range bound markets.\nThe aforementioned particular stock price movement is assimilated with a\nquantum tunneling effect. The probability of stock price to quantum tunneling\nout of the bounded region, known as transmission coefficient, is deduced.\nQuantum aspects of tunneling effect in financial markets are discussed. Recent\nevidences of price quantum tunneling in stock market are also shown.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Jul 2013 12:56:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-26"}

Trench warfare\nsituations are stable cycles of allele frequencies at the coevolving loci of\nboth host and parasite, and it is predicted that the loci will show molecular\nevolutionary signatures of balancing selection, while arms races involve\nsuccessive selective sweeps at the interacting loci. We study a haploid\ngene-for-gene model that includes mutation and genetic drift due to finite\npopulation size. We study the outcomes under different coevolutionary\nparameters to quantify the frequency of fixation of alleles, i.e. occurrence of\nan arms race dynamics. We find that contrary to the conventional wisdom, trench\nwarfare situations do not imply larger numbers of coevolutionary cycles per\nunit time than arms races. Therefore, one cannot infer the nature of the\ndynamics in such systems based on the speed of coevolution estimated from cycle\ntimes. We subsequently perform coalescent simulations to generate sequences at\nthe host and parasite loci. We ask whether the signatures expected under\nbalancing selection or selective sweeps (unexpectedly high or low diversity,\nand high or low Tajima D values, respectively) are likely to be observable in\ngenomic data. Genomic footprints of recurrent selective sweeps are often found,\nwhereas trench warfare yields signatures of balancing selection only in\nparasite sequences, and only in a limited parameter space with high effective\npopulation sizes and long-term selection. Therefore, the existence of a\ndeterministic polymorphic equilibrium does not imply long-term trench warfare\nnecessary for the signature of balancing selection to be observed in the\ncoevolving genes sequence. Our results suggest that to search for signatures of\ncoevolution via population genomics, it is best to study pathogen rather than\nhost genomes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Jul 2013 13:07:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 Sep 2013 10:15:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-20"}

In the\ncase of the twisted bilayers, the dispersion has instead its symmetry reduced\ndown to the C_{3v} group and, most importantly, it leads to susceptibilities\nthat diverge at the saddle points but are integrable along the Fermi line. This\nimplies that a ferromagnetic instability becomes dominant in the twisted\ngraphene bilayers near the Van Hove singularity, with a strength which is\namplified as the lowest subband of the electron system becomes flatter for\ndecreasing twist angle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Jul 2013 13:56:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

Via the Cartan-Dieudonne\ntheorem, the reflective symmetries of the Platonic solids generate rotations.\nIn a Clifford algebra framework, the space of spinors generating such\nthree-dimensional rotations has a natural four-dimensional Euclidean structure.\nThe spinors arising from the Platonic Solids can thus in turn be interpreted as\nvertices in four-dimensional space, giving a simple construction of the 4D\npolytopes 16-cell, 24-cell, the F_4 root system and the 600-cell. In\nparticular, these polytopes have `mysterious' symmetries, that are almost\ntrivial when seen from the three-dimensional spinorial point of view. In fact,\nall these induced polytopes are also known to be root systems and thus generate\nrank-4 Coxeter groups, which can be shown to be a general property of the\nspinor construction. These considerations thus also apply to other root systems\nsuch as A_1+I_2(n) which induces I_2(n)+I_2(n), explaining the existence of the\ngrand antiprism and the snub 24-cell, as well as their symmetries. We discuss\nthese results in the wider mathematical context of Arnol'd's trinities and the\nMcKay correspondence. These results are thus a novel link between the\ngeometries of three and four dimensions, with interesting potential\napplications on both sides of the correspondence, to real 3D systems with\npolyhedral symmetries such as (quasi)crystals and viruses, as well as 4D\ngeometries arising for instance in Grand Unified Theories and String and\nM-Theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Jul 2013 15:02:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-19"}

A multiwavelength spectral energy\ndistribution (SED) is constructed from contemporaneous data from VERITAS,\nFermi-LAT, RXTE PCA, and Swift UVOT. Swift XRT data is not included in the SED\ndue to a lack of simultaneous observations with VERITAS. In contrast to the\norphan gamma-ray flare exhibited by this source in 2002, the X-ray flux of the\nsource is found to vary by an order of magnitude, while other energy regimes\nexhibit less variable emission. A quasi-equilibrium synchrotron self-Compton\nmodel with an additional external radiation field is used to describe three\nSEDs corresponding to the lowest, highest, and average X-ray states. The\nvariation in the X-ray spectrum is modeled by changing the electron injection\nspectral index, with minor adjustments of the kinetic luminosity in electrons.\nThis scenario produces small-scale flux variability of order >~2 in the HE (E>1\nMeV) and VHE (E>100 GeV) gamma-ray regimes, which is corroborated by the\nFermi-LAT, VERITAS, and Whipple 10m telescope light curves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Jul 2013 15:08:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-30"}

By focusing on triadic relations, which yield the simplest\ntype of transitivity, we generalize the concept and computation of clustering\ncoefficients to multiplex networks. We show how the layered structure of such\nnetworks introduces a new degree of freedom that has a fundamental effect on\ntransitivity. We compute multiplex clustering coefficients for several real\nmultiplex networks and illustrate why one must take great care when\ngeneralizing standard network concepts to multiplex networks. We also derive\nanalytical expressions for our clustering coefficients for ensemble averages of\nnetworks in a family of random multiplex networks. Our analysis illustrates\nthat social networks have a strong tendency to promote redundancy by closing\ntriads at every layer and that they thereby have a different type of multiplex\ntransitivity from transportation networks, which do not exhibit such a\ntendency.

Ways to stimulate interdisciplinary research collaborations are\ntherefore an increasing point of attention for science policy. There is concern\nthat 'regular' funding programs, involving advice from disciplinary experts and\ndiscipline-bound viewpoints, may not adequately stimulate, select or evaluate\nthis kind of research. This has led to specific policies aimed at\ninterdisciplinary research in many countries. There is however at this moment\nno generally accepted method to adequately select and evaluate\ninterdisciplinary research. In the vast context of different forms of\ninterdisciplinarity, this paper aims to contribute to the debate on best\npractices to stimulate and support interdisciplinary research collaborations.\nIt describes the selection procedures and results of a university program\nsupporting networks formed 'bottom up', integrating expertise from different\ndisciplines. The program's recent evaluation indicates that it is successful in\nselecting and supporting the interdisciplinary synergies aimed for, responding\nto a need experienced in the field.

This paper introduces a model for\ncotranslational folding that leads to a natural definition of a nested energy\nlandscape. By applying concepts drawn from submanifold differential geometry\nthe dynamics of protein folding on the ribosome can be explored in a\nquantitative manner and conditions on the nested potential energy landscapes\nfor a good cotranslational folder are obtained. A generalisation of diffusion\nrate theory using van Kampen's technique of composite stochastic processes is\nthen used to account for entropic contributions and the effects of variable\ntranslation rates on cotranslational folding. This stochastic approach agrees\nwell with experimental results and Hamiltionian formalism in the deterministic\nlimit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Jul 2013 15:53:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Oct 2013 16:43:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-17"}
