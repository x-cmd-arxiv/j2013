In the resulting \"Molecular\nDistance Map\" each point signifies a DNA sequence, and the geometric distance\nbetween any two points reflects the degree of relatedness between the\ncorresponding sequences and species.\n  Molecular Distance Maps present compelling visual representations of\nrelationships between species and could be used for taxonomic clarifications,\nfor species identification, and for studies of evolutionary history. One of the\nadvantages of this method is its general applicability since, as sequence\nalignment is not required, the DNA sequences chosen for comparison can be\ncompletely different regions in different genomes. In fact, this method can be\nused to compare any two DNA sequences. For example, in our dataset of 3,176\nmitochondrial DNA sequences, it correctly finds the mtDNA sequences most\nclosely related to that of the anatomically modern human (the Neanderthal, the\nDenisovan, and the chimp), and it finds that the sequence most different from\nit belongs to a cucumber.

While there has been evidence for\nunconventional pairing in this compound, high-resolution spectroscopic\nmeasurements of the superconducting state have been lacking. Previously, we\nhave used high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy techniques to visualize\nthe emergence of heavy-fermion excitations in CeCoIn5 and demonstrate the\ncomposite nature of these excitations well above Tc. Here we extend these\ntechniques to much lower temperatures to investigate how superconductivity\ndevelops within a strongly correlated band of composite excitations. We find\nthe spectrum of heavy excitations to be strongly modified just prior to the\nonset of superconductivity by a suppression of the spectral weight near the\nFermi energy, reminiscent of the pseudogap state in the cuprates. By measuring\nthe response of superconductivity to various perturbations, through both\nquasiparticle interference and local pair-breaking experiments, we demonstrate\nthe nodal d-wave character of superconducting pairing in CeCoIn5.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Jul 2013 22:38:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-16"}

The H_2O maser spectrum has a very wide line-of-sight velocity\nrange (~310 km/s) and consists of three groups of emission features at the\nblue-shifted (-68 km/s <~ V_LSR <~ -17 km/s) and red-shifted (V_LSR ~= 240\nkm/s) edges as well as around the systemic velocity (112 km/s <~ V_LSR <~ 133\nkm/s).

A primary concern for the network designer in routing games is\nthe average agent delay at equilibrium. A number of methods to control this\naverage delay have received substantial attention, including network tolls,\nStackelberg routing, and edge removal.\n  A related approach with arguably greater practical relevance is that of\nmaking investments in improvements to the edges of the network, so that, for a\ngiven investment budget, the average delay at equilibrium in the improved\nnetwork is minimized.

To our knowledge, none of this work gives guarantees on the\noutput quality of any polynomial-time algorithm. We study a model for this\nproblem introduced in transportation research literature, and present both\nhardness results and algorithms that obtain nearly optimal performance\nguarantees.\n  - We first show that a simple algorithm obtains good approximation guarantees\nfor the problem.

However, for graphs that consist of a series of parallel\nlinks, we show the problem is weakly NP-hard.\n  - Finally, we consider the problem in series-parallel graphs, and give an\nFPTAS for this case.\n  Our work thus formalizes the intuition held by transportation researchers\nthat the network improvement problem is hard, and presents topology-dependent\nalgorithms that have provably tight approximation guarantees.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Jul 2013 23:16:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 10 Nov 2013 20:32:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-12"}

Two further types of conditionals are defined\nusing the propositional calculus and Boole's mathematical logic:\ntruth-functional and Boolean feasibility (which turn out to be special cases of\nprobabilistic conditionals). Each probabilistic conditional is quantified by a\nfractional parameter between zero and one that says whether it is purely\naffirmative, purely negative, or intermediate in its sense. Conditionals can be\nspecialized further by their content to express factuality and\ncounterfactuality, and revised or reformulated to account for exceptions and\nconfounding factors. The various conditionals have distinct mathematical\nrepresentations: through intermediate probability expressions and logical\nformulas, each conditional is eventually translated into a set of polynomial\nequations and inequalities (with real coefficients).

In addition,\nexisting sparse coding algorithms use graph Laplacian to model the local\ngeometry of the data distribution.

In this paper, we present multiview Hessian\ndiscriminative sparse coding (mHDSC) which seamlessly integrates Hessian\nregularization with discriminative sparse coding for multiview learning\nproblems. In particular, mHDSC exploits Hessian regularization to steer the\nsolution which varies smoothly along geodesics in the manifold, and treats the\nlabel information as an additional view of feature for incorporating the\ndiscriminative power for image annotation.

This work is motivated by the\ninsufficiently understood observed consequences of the H-ingestion flash in\npost-AGB stars (Sakurai's object) and metal-poor AGB stars. Our investigation\nis focused on the entrainment process at the top convection boundary and on the\nsubsequent advection of H-rich material into deeper layers, and we therefore\nignore the burning of the proton-rich fuel in this study. We find that, for our\ndeep convection zone, coherent convective motions of near global scale appear\nto dominate the flow. At the top boundary convective shear flows are stable\nagainst Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities. However, such shear instabilities are\ninduced by the boundary-layer separation in large-scale, opposing flows. This\nlinks the global nature of thick shell convection with the entrainment process.\nWe establish the quantitative dependence of the entrainment rate on grid\nresolution.

Our proof relies on an accessible\nsymmetry argument and the use of statistical hypothesis testing to reject a\nglobal null hypothesis at the 10^-100 level of significance. It is, to the best\nof our knowledge, the first relatively rigorous identification of efficient\ncomputational learning in an evolutionary algorithm on a non-trivial learning\nproblem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Jul 2013 06:32:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-16"}

If accurate\ntop-N recommendation lists are to be produced for such graded relevance\ndomains, it is critical to generate a ranked list of recommended items directly\nrather than predicting ratings. Current techniques choose one of two\nsub-optimal approaches: either they optimize for a binary metric such as\nAverage Precision, which discards information on relevance grades, or they\noptimize for Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG), which ignores the\ndependence of an item's contribution on the relevance of more highly ranked\nitems.\n  In this paper, we address the shortcomings of existing approaches by\nproposing the Graded Average Precision factor model (GAPfm), a latent factor\nmodel that is particularly suited to the problem of top-N recommendation in\ndomains with graded relevance data. The model optimizes for Graded Average\nPrecision, a metric that has been proposed recently for assessing the quality\nof ranked results list for graded relevance. GAPfm learns a latent factor model\nby directly optimizing a smoothed approximation of GAP. GAPfm's advantages are\ntwofold: it maintains full information about graded relevance and also\naddresses the limitations of models that optimize NDCG. Experimental results\nshow that GAPfm achieves substantial improvements on the top-N recommendation\ntask, compared to several state-of-the-art approaches. In order to ensure that\nGAPfm is able to scale to very large data sets, we propose a fast learning\nalgorithm that uses an adaptive item selection strategy. A final experiment\nshows that GAPfm is useful not only for generating recommendation lists, but\nalso for ranking a given list of rated items.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Jul 2013 08:55:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-16"}

Comparison of the period distribution for the entire\nsample of RRLs with similar distributions in nearby dSphs and in the Large\nMagellanic Cloud indicates that the old stellar populations in these systems\nshare similar properties. This finding is also supported by the RRL\ndistribution in the Bailey diagram.

Each of the existing implementations offers\na trade-off between space occupancy and decompression speed, so software\nengineers have to content themselves by picking the one which comes closer to\nthe requirements of the application in their hands. Starting from these\npremises, and for the first time in the literature, we address in this paper\nthe problem of trading optimally, and in a principled way, the consumption of\nthese two resources by introducing the Bicriteria LZ77-Parsing problem, which\nformalizes in a principled way what data-compressors have traditionally\napproached by means of heuristics. The goal is to determine an LZ77 parsing\nwhich minimizes the space occupancy in bits of the compressed file, provided\nthat the decompression time is bounded by a fixed amount (or vice-versa). This\nway, the software engineer can set its space (or time) requirements and then\nderive the LZ77 parsing which optimizes the decompression speed (or the space\noccupancy, respectively). We solve this problem efficiently in O(n log^2 n)\ntime and optimal linear space within a small, additive approximation, by\nproving and deploying some specific structural properties of the weighted graph\nderived from the possible LZ77-parsings of the input file.

Motions in the fluid are driven by differential\nrotation of the outer metallic shell, which we refer to as \"the wall\". The two\nhemispheres of the wall are held in counter-rotation, producing a steady,\naxisymmetric interior flow consisting of differential rotation and a two-cell\nmeridional circulation with radial inflow in the equatorial plane. From\nprevious studies, this type of flow is known to maintain a stationary\nequatorial dipole by dynamo action if the magnetic Reynolds number is larger\nthan about 300 and if the outer boundary is electrically insulating. We vary\nindependently the thickness, electrical conductivity, and magnetic permeability\nof the wall to determine their effect on the dynamo action. The main results\nare: (a) Increasing the conductivity of the wall hinders the dynamo by allowing\neddy currents within the wall, which are induced by the relative motion of the\nequatorial dipole field and the wall. This processes can be viewed as a skin\neffect or, equivalently, as the tearing apart of the dipole by the differential\nrotation of the wall, to which the field lines are anchored by high\nconductivity. (b) Increasing the magnetic permeability of the wall favors\ndynamo action by constraining the magnetic field lines in the fluid to be\nnormal to the wall, thereby decoupling the fluid from any induction in the\nwall. (c) Decreasing the wall thickness limits the amplitude of the eddy\ncurrents, and is therefore favorable for dynamo action, provided that the wall\nis thinner than the skin depth. We explicitly demonstrate these effects of the\nwall properties on the dynamo field by deriving an effective boundary condition\nin the limit of vanishing wall thickness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Jul 2013 10:16:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 8 Nov 2013 09:29:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-08"}

The MgII associated absorption systems having a velocity offset v\n< 5000km/s from the systemic velocity of the background quasar were also\nexcluded. Existing spectroscopic data for redshift-matched sightlines of 3975\nCDQs and 1583 LDQs, covering a emission redshift range 0.39-4.87, were analysed\nand 864 strong MgII absorbers were found, covering the redshift range\n0.45-2.17. The conclusions reached using this well-defined large dataset of\nstrong MgII absorbers are: (i) The number density, dN/dz, towards CDQs shows a\nsmall, marginally significant excess over the estimate available for QSOs; (ii)\nIn the redshift space, this difference is reflected in terms of a 1.6sigma\nexcess of dN/dz over the QSOs, within the narrow redshift interval 1.2-1.8;\n(iii) The dN/dbeta distribution (with beta=v/c) for CDQs shows a significant\nexcess over the distribution found for a redshift and luminosity matched sample\nof QSOs, at beta in the range 0.05-0.1. This leads us to infer that a\nsignificant fraction of strong MgII absorption systems seen in this offset\nvelocity range are probably associated with the CDQs and might be accelerated\ninto the line of sight by their powerful jets and/or due to the accretion-disk\noutflows close to our direction. Support to this scenario comes from a\nconsistency check in which we only consider the spectral range corresponding to\nbeta > 0.2. The computed redshift distribution for strong MgII absorbers\ntowards CDQs now shows excellent agreement with that known for QSOs, as indeed\nis expected for purely intervening absorption systems. Thus, it appears that\nfor CDQs the associated strong MgII absorbers can be seen at much larger\nvelocities relative to the nucleus than the commonly adopted upper limit of\n5000km/s.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Jul 2013 12:06:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

In\nparticular, TMOs with mixed valences have attracted attention for many energy\napplications. Previous studies also showed that the ability to control the\nnumber of d-band electron populations and detailed spin configurations is\ncritical for improved catalytic performance of TMOs. In this context,\nSrCoO$_{x}$ (2.5 < x < 3.0) is an ideal class of materials due to the existence\nof two structurally distinct topotatic phases, i.e. the brownmillerite\nSrCoO$_{2.5}$(BM-SCO) and the perovskite SrCoO$_{3}$. Especially, BM-SCO has\natomically-ordered one-dimensional vacancy channels, which can accommodate\nadditional oxygen. Moreover, SrCoO$_{x}$ exhibits a wide spectrum of physical\nproperties depending on the oxygen stoichiometry. Since SrCoOx has only a\nsingle knob to control the Co valence state without cation doping, it is an\nattractive material for studying the valence state dependent physical\nproperties. However, so far, the growth of high quality single crystalline\nmaterials has not been much studied due to difficulty in controlling the right\noxidation state.

Also the\nscaling of the magnetic dissipation time turns out to be more complex than\npreviously suggested. Assuming that the processes relevant in the numerical\nmodels are the same as in Earth's core, we use this scaling to estimate an\nOhmic dissipation of 3-8 TW for the core.

It is\nargued that the regions of low density are flow channels carved by\nsunward-directed outflow jets from reconnection. The solar corona is\nstratified, so the flare site is populated by a lower density plasma than that\nin the underlying arcade. As the jets penetrate the arcade, they carve out\nregions of depleted plasma density which appear as SADs. The present\ninterpretation differs from previous models in that reconnection is localized\nin space but not in time. Reconnection is continuous in time to explain why\nSADs are not filled in from behind as they would if they were caused by\nisolated descending flux tubes or the wakes behind them due to temporally\nbursty reconnection. Reconnection is localized in space because outflow jets in\nstandard two-dimensional reconnection models expand in the normal (inflow)\ndirection with distance from the reconnection site, which would not produce\nthin SADs as seen in observations. On the contrary, outflow jets in spatially\nlocalized three-dimensional reconnection with an out-of-plane (guide) magnetic\nfield expand primarily in the out-of-plane direction and remain collimated in\nthe normal direction, which is consistent with observed SADs being thin.\nTwo-dimensional proof-of-principle simulations of reconnection with an\nout-of-plane (guide) magnetic field confirm the creation of SAD-like depletion\nregions and the necessity of density stratification.

If\none imposes the local gauge symmetry of the Standard Model (SM) ($SU(3)_c\n\\times SU(2)_L \\times U(1)_Y$) to the SM and any possible new physics\nscenarios, the SM Higgs properties will be modified by intrinsically two\ndifferent ways: by new physics either coupling directly to the SM Higgs boson\n$h$, or affecting indirectly the SM Higgs properties through the mixing of $h$\nwith a SM singlet scalar $s$. The models of two Higgs doublet, extra sequential\nand mirror fermions belong to the first category, whereas the models with a\nhidden sector dark matter, extra vector-like fermions and new charged vector\nbosons, which can enhance the diphoton rate of the SM Higgs-like resonance,\nbelong to the second category. We perform a global fit to data in terms of the\neffective Lagrangian description of two interaction eigenstates of scalar\nbosons, a SM Higgs and a singlet scalar, and their mixing. This framework is\nmore suitable to study singlet-extended scenarios discussed above compared to\nother approaches based on the Lagrangian of mass eigenstates. With fairly\nmodel-independent assumptions, the effective Lagrangian contains at most four\nfree parameters still encompassing the majority of models in the literature.\nInterestingly, the SM gives the best fit if all data from ATLAS and CMS are\nused, whereas various singlet extensions can fit better to individual ATLAS or\nCMS data.

Using the Lambda(1405)\nansatz with a PDG mass of 1405 MeV/ c^2 for K^-p, the following ground-state\nbinding energies together with the wave functions were obtained: 51.5 MeV ( K^\n- pp ), 69 MeV ( K^ - ppn), 30.4 MeV ( K^ - K^ - p ) and 93 MeV ( K^ -K^ - pp\n), which are in good agreement with previous results of variational calculation\nbased on the Akaishi-Yamazaki coupled-channel potential.

This work focuses on a particular approach for this purpose\ncalled independence-based learning. Such approach guarantees the learning of\nthe correct structure efficiently, whenever data is sufficient for representing\nthe underlying distribution. However, an important issue of such approach is\nthat the learned structures are encoded in an undirected graph. The problem\nwith graphs is that they cannot encode some types of independence relations,\nsuch as the context-specific independences. They are a particular case of\nconditional independences that is true only for a certain assignment of its\nconditioning set, in contrast to conditional independences that must hold for\nall its assignments. In this work we present CSPC, an independence-based\nalgorithm for learning structures that encode context-specific independences,\nand encoding them in a log-linear model, instead of a graph. The central idea\nof CSPC is combining the theoretical guarantees provided by the\nindependence-based approach with the benefits of representing complex\nstructures by using features in a log-linear model.

We find that for a levitated nanoparticle the thermal\nenergy suffices to drive the motion of the nanoparticle into the nonlinear\nregime. First, we experimentally measure and fully characterize the frequency\nfluctuations originating from thermal motion and nonlinearities. Second, we\ndemonstrate that feedback cooling can be used to mitigate these fluctuations.\nThe high level of control allows us to fully exploit the force sensing\ncapabilities of the nanoresonator. Our approach offers a force sensitivity of\n20 zN $Hz^{-1/2}$, which is the highest value reported to date at room\ntemperature, sufficient to sense ultra-weak interactions, such as non-Newtonian\ngravity-like forces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Jul 2013 08:56:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-10"}

The problem of the basis\nrotations and that of the selection of phases in the Dirac-like and\nMajorana-like field operators are considered. The discrete symmetries\nproperties (P, C, T) are studied. Particular attention has been paid to the\nquestion of (anti)commutation of the Charge conjugation operator and the Parity\nin the helicity basis. Dynamical equations have also been presented. In the\n(1/2,0)+(0,1/2) representation they obey the Dirac-like equation with eight\ncomponents, which has been first introduced by Markov. Thus, the Fock space for\ncorresponding quantum fields is doubled (as shown by Ziino). The chirality and\nthe helicity for Dirac and Majorana states have been discussed.
