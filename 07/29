In\nparticular, electric field application decreases the transition temperature\nTAFM to antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase and induces ferromagnetic (FM) phase, so\nthat at some E field larger than the critical field (Ecr), TFM becomes higher\nthan TAFM and the FM phase appears. Note that Ecr increases and magnetization\ndecreases as the temperature increases. The value of the critical field Ecr =\n0.40*10^6 V/cm we calculated appeared close to the value Ecr = 0.5*10^6 V/cm\nobtained recently by Ryan et al. with the help of density functional theory for\nEuTiO3 film under a compressive strain produced by substrate. At the fields E\n>0.83*10^6 V/cm, AFM disappears for all considered temperatures and so FM\nbecomes the only stable magnetic phase. We find that ferromagnetic phase can be\ninduced by an E-field in other paraelectric antiferromagnet oxides with a\npositive AFM-type magnetoelectric (ME) coupling coefficient and negative\nFM-type ME coupling coefficient. In particular, the critical E-field was\nestimated for another paraelectric antiferromagnet Sr0.7Ba0.3MnO3 as\n0.2x10^5V/cm at 0 K. Analysis of the dependence of magnetization and\nantimagnetization on the external electric field and the polarization induced\nby the field, which yields the magnetoelectric coupling, is reported.

The neutrino-antineutrino asymmetry in the\nelectron-neutrino appearance probability has contributions from both the CP\nphase and the matter effect. For this reason, experimental sensitivity to the\nmass hierarchy depends both on the true value of the CP phase and the true mass\nhierarchy; LBNE10 will determine the mass hierarchy at high levels of\nsignificance for half of CP phase space.

They may cause bandwidth loss due to \\emph{flow collisions} on\na same link. Recently proposed centralized scheduling algorithm or host-based\nmulti-pathing may suffer from scalability problems.\n  In this paper, we present Distributed Flow Scheduling (DiFS) for data center\nnetworks, which is a switch-only distributed solution. DiFS allows switches\ncooperate to avoid over-utilized links and find available paths without\ncentralized control. DiFS is scalable and can react quickly to dynamic traffic,\nbecause it is independently executed on switches and requires no\nsynchronization. Extensive experiments show that the aggregate bisection\nbandwidth of DiFS using various traffic patterns is much better than that of\nECMP, and is similar to or higher than that of a recent proposed centralized\nscheduling algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Jul 2013 22:48:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-30"}

It is known that up to three\ndistinct solutions exist, which are characterized by the CR production\nefficiency as \"efficient\", \"intermediate\" and \"inefficient\" branches. The\nstability of these solutions is investigated by performing direct\ntime-dependent simulations of a two-fluid model. It is found that both the\nefficient and inefficient branches are stable even against a large-amplitude\nperturbation, while the intermediate one is always unstable and evolves into\nthe inefficient state as a result of nonlinear time development. This bistable\nfeature is robust in a wide range of parameters and does not depend on the\ninjection model. Fully nonlinear time evolution of a hydrodynamic shock with\ninjection results in the least efficient state in terms of the CR production,\nconsistent with the bistable feature. This suggests that the CR production\nefficiency at supernova remnant shocks may be lower than previously discussed\nin the framework of the nonlinear shock acceleration theory considering the\nefficient solution of the CRMS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jul 2013 01:42:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 31 Jul 2013 11:00:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

As Gusfield and Irving have already noted in 1989, no results are known\nregarding achieving this feat by means other than such preference-list\ntruncation, i.e. by also permuting preference lists.\n  We answer Gusfield and Irving's open question by providing tight upper bounds\non the amount of blacklists and their combined size, that are required by the\nwomen to force a given matching as the M-optimal stable matching, or, more\ngenerally, as the unique stable matching.

When there are less women\nthan men, we show that in the absence of blacklists for men, the women can\nforce any matching as the unique stable matching without blacklisting anyone,\nwhile when there are more women than men, each to-be-unmatched woman may have\nto blacklist as many as all men.

This was the closest known approach by an asteroid of\nseveral hundred metre diameter since 1976 when a similar size object passed at\n0.5 lunar distances. We observed 2005 YU55 from ground with a recently\ndeveloped mid-IR camera (miniTAO/MAX38) in N- and Q-band and with the\nSubmillimeter Array (SMA) at 1.3 mm. In addition, we obtained space\nobservations with Herschel/PACS at 70, 100, and 160 micron.

To date, most algorithms that aim to find\ncommunity structures only focus either on unipartite or bipartite networks. A\nunipartite network consists of one set of nodes and a bipartite network\nconsists of two nonoverlapping sets of nodes with only links joining the nodes\nin different sets. However, a third type of network exists, defined here as the\nmixture network. Just like a bipartite network, a mixture network also consists\nof two sets of nodes, but some nodes may simultaneously belong to two sets,\nwhich breaks the nonoverlapping restriction of a bipartite network. The mixture\nnetwork can be considered as a general case, with unipartite and bipartite\nnetworks viewed as its limiting cases. A mixture network can represent not only\nall the unipartite and bipartite networks, but also a wide range of real-world\nnetworks that cannot be properly represented as either unipartite or bipartite\nnetworks in fields such as biology and social science. Based on this\nobservation, we first propose a probabilistic model that can find modules in\nunipartite, bipartite, and mixture networks in a unified framework based on the\nlink community model for a unipartite undirected network [B Ball et al (2011\nPhys.

We test our algorithm on synthetic networks (both\noverlapping and nonoverlapping communities) and apply it to two real-world\nnetworks: a southern women bipartite network and a human transcriptional\nregulatory mixture network.

The Fe-Cr alloys are candidate structural materials for the new\ngeneration of nuclear reactors. The surfaces of these alloys will be exposed to\nhydrogen or its isotopes in these reactors, and although hydrogen is soluble\nneither in Fe nor in Fe-Cr alloys, it is known that the adsorption energy of\nhydrogen on the surface of iron is not only exothermic but relatively large.\nThis clearly raises the question of the effect of the hydrogen adsorbed on the\nsurface of iron on the segregation behavior of chromium towards the surface of\niron. In this paper we show, on the basis of our ab initio density functional\ntheory calculations, that the presence of hydrogen on the surface of iron leads\nto a considerably reduced barrier for Cr segregation to both the topmost\nsurface layer and the subsurface layer, but the subsurface layer still controls\nthe barrier for surface segregation. This reduction in the barrier for surface\nsegregation is due to the nature of the Cr-H couple that acts in a complex and\nsynergistic manner. The presence of Cr enhances the exothermic nature of\nhydrogen adsorption that in turn leads to a reduced barrier for surface\nsegregation. These results should be included in the multiscale modeling of\nFe-Cr alloys.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jul 2013 14:12:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-30"}

The XMM-Newton survey of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC)\ncompletely covers the bar and eastern wing with a 5.6 deg^2 area in the\n(0.2-12.0) keV band. To characterise the X-ray sources in the SMC field, we\ncreated a catalogue of point sources and sources with moderate extent.

We searched\nfor point sources in the EPIC images using sliding-box and maximum-likelihood\ntechniques and classified the sources using hardness ratios, X-ray variability,\nand their multi-wavelength properties. The catalogue comprises 3053 unique\nX-ray sources with a median position uncertainty of 1.3\" down to a flux limit\nfor point sources of ~10^-14 erg cm^-2 s^-1 in the (0.2-4.5) keV band,\ncorresponding to 5x10^33 erg s^-1 for sources in the SMC.

The fact that freezing occurs due to the maximum value out of\nlarge number of nucleation temperatures, means that we can apply the results of\nwhat is called extreme-value statistics. This is the statistics of the extreme,\ni.e., maximum or minimum, value of a large number of random variables.

Thus, the subsurface layer presents a huge\nbarrier, not only for the segregation of Cr from the bulk to the surface, but\nalso for its diffusion from the surface into the bulk. This means that the\ntopmost layer alone cannot be used to determine the barrier for Cr segregation\n(the segregation energy), which is determined in these alloys by the subsurface\nlayer.

Light curves are believed to be resulting from internal\nshocks reflecting the activities of the GRB central engine. Hence their\ntemporal studies can potentially lead to an understanding of the GRB central\nengine and its evolution. The light curve variability time scale is an\ninteresting parameter which most models attribute to a physical origin e.g.,\ncentral engine activity, clumpy circum-burst medium, or relativistic\nturbulence. We develop a statistical method to estimate the GRB minimum\nvariability time scale (MVT) for long and short GRBs detected by GBM. We find\nthat the MVT of short bursts is distinctly shorter than that of long GRBs\nsupporting the possibility of a more compact central engine of the former. We\nalso find that MVT estimated by this method is consistent with the shortest\nrise time of the fitted pulses. Hence we use the fitted pulse rise times to\nstudy the evolution of burst variability time scale. Variability time coupled\nwith the highest energy photon detected in turn related to the minimum bulk\nLorentz factor of the relativistic shell emitted by the inner engine. %Using\nthis we relate the GRB spectral evolution to the evolution of the variability\ntime scale.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jul 2013 15:42:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-30"}

In the\nproposed approach, tag similarity and tag relevance are jointly estimated in an\niterative manner, so that they can benefit from each other, and the multi-wise\nrelationships among tags are explored. Moreover, both the statistics of tags\nand visual affinities of images in the corpus are explored to help topic\nmodeling. We also analyze the superiority of our approach from the deep\nstructure perspective. The experiments on tag ranking and image retrieval\ndemonstrate the advantages of the proposed method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jul 2013 08:12:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-31"}

Pestov (in 2011 Dagstuhl preprint). Any consistent learning\nalgorithm, for example kNN, retains universal consistency after a Borel\nisomorphism is applied. A series of concrete examples of Borel isomorphisms\nthat reduce the number of dimensions in a dataset is provided, based on\nmultiplying the data by orthogonal matrices before the dimensionality reducing\nBorel isomorphism is applied. We test the accuracy of the resulting classifier\nin a lower dimensional space with various data sets. Working with a phoneme\nvoice recognition dataset, of dimension 256 with 5 classes (phonemes), we show\nthat a Borel isomorphic reduction to dimension 16 leads to a minimal drop in\naccuracy. In conclusion, we discuss further prospects of the method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jul 2013 03:09:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-01"}

We consider particles moving in equatorial plane and calculate\ntheir center of mass energy. Firstly, we explore center of mass energy of a\nregular black hole. In this case, acceleration and collision of particles lead\nto high center of mass energy which is independent of event horizon and naked\nsingularity. Secondly, we investigate the center of mass energy of Plebanski\nand Demianski black hole (non-extremal) with zero NUT parameter. Here the\ncenter of mass energy depends upon the rotation parameter. We conclude that the\ncenter of mass energy becomes infinitely large for both black holes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jul 2013 09:36:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}
