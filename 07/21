The motivation of this study comes from many situations\nthat involve repeatedly making choices subject to arbitrary constraints in an\nuncertain environment: for instance, regularly deciding which advertisements to\ndisplay online in order to gain high click-through-rate without knowing user\npreferences, or what route to drive home each day under uncertain weather and\ntraffic conditions. Assume that there are $K$ unknown random variables (RVs),\ni.e., arms, each evolving as an \\emph{i.i.d} stochastic process over time. At\neach decision epoch, we select a strategy, i.e., a subset of RVs, subject to\narbitrary constraints on constituent RVs.\n  We then gain a reward that is a linear combination of observations on\nselected RVs.\n  The performance of prior results for this problem heavily depends on the\ndistribution of strategies generated by corresponding learning policy. For\nexample, if the reward-difference between the best and second best strategy\napproaches zero, prior result may lead to arbitrarily large regret.\n  Meanwhile, when there are exponential number of possible strategies at each\ndecision point, naive extension of a prior distribution-free policy would cause\npoor performance in terms of regret, computation and space complexity.\n  To this end, we propose an efficient Distribution-Free Learning (DFL) policy\nthat achieves zero regret, regardless of the probability distribution of the\nresultant strategies.\n  Our learning policy has both $O(K)$ time complexity and $O(K)$ space\ncomplexity. In successive generations, we show that even if finding the optimal\nstrategy at each decision point is NP-hard, our policy still allows for\napproximated solutions while retaining near zero-regret.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Jul 2013 16:40:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 11 May 2014 03:45:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 5 Oct 2014 04:20:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-07"}

In this paper, we study the familiar problem of reducing data\ncenter energy cost with two new perspectives. First, we find, through an\nempirical study of contracts from electric utilities powering Google data\ncenters, that demand charge per kW for the maximum power used is a major\ncomponent of the total cost. Second, many services such as Web search tolerate\npartial execution of the requests because the response quality is a concave\nfunction of processing time. Data from Microsoft Bing search engine confirms\nthis observation.\n  We propose a simple idea of using partial execution to reduce the peak power\ndemand and energy cost of data centers. We systematically study the problem of\nscheduling partial execution with stringent SLAs on response quality. For a\nsingle data center, we derive an optimal algorithm to solve the workload\nscheduling problem. In the case of multiple geo-distributed data centers, the\ndemand of each data center is controlled by the request routing algorithm,\nwhich makes the problem much more involved. We decouple the two aspects, and\ndevelop a distributed optimization algorithm to solve the large-scale request\nrouting problem. Trace-driven simulations show that partial execution reduces\ncost by $3\\%--10.5\\%$ for one data center, and by $15.5\\%$ for geo-distributed\ndata centers together with request routing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Jul 2013 17:19:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Dec 2013 09:31:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-18"}

Unlike the mechanism of urea-induced unfolding of proteins, which is\nwell understood, the action of urea on RNA has barely been explored. We\nperformed extensive all atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to determine\nthe molecular underpinnings of urea-induced RNA denaturation. Urea displays its\ndenaturing power in both secondary and tertiary motifs of the riboswitch (RS)\nstructure. Our simulations reveal that the denaturation of RNA structures is\nmainly driven by the hydrogen bonds and stacking interactions of urea with the\nbases. Through detailed studies of the simulation trajectories, we found that\ngeminate pairs between urea and bases due to hydrogen bonds and stacks persist\nonly ~ (0.1-1) ns, which suggests that urea-base interaction is highly dynamic.\nMost importantly, the early stage of base pair disruption is triggered by\npenetration of water molecules into the hydrophobic domain between the RNA\nbases. The infiltration of water into the narrow space between base pairs is\ncritical in increasing the accessibility of urea to transiently disrupted\nbases, thus allowing urea to displace inter base hydrogen bonds. This\nmechanism, water-induced disruption of base-pairs resulting in the formation of\na \"wet\" destabilized RNA followed by solvation by urea, is the exact opposite\nof the two-stage denaturation of proteins by urea. In the latter case, initial\nurea penetration creates a dry-globule, which is subsequently solvated by water\npenetration leading to global protein unfolding. Our work shows that the\nability to interact with both water and polar, non-polar components of\nnucleotides makes urea a powerful chemical denaturant for nucleic acids.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Jul 2013 22:02:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-23"}

Starting from\nP. Schreiber's idea, published in 1993, we prove that these polygons are not\nconstructible from their side lengths with straightedge and compass, provided\n$n$ is at least five. They are non-constructible even in the particular case\nwhere they only have two different integer side lengths, provided that $n\\neq\n6$. To achieve this goal, we develop two tools of separate interest. First, we\nprove a limit theorem stating that, under reasonable conditions, geometric\nconstructibility is preserved under taking limits. To do so, we tailor a\nparticular case of Puiseux's classical theorem on some generalized power\nseries, called Puiseux series, over algebraically closed fields to an analogous\ntheorem on these series over real square root closed fields. Second, based on\nHilbert's irreducibility theorem, we give a \\emph{rational parameter theorem}\nthat, under reasonable conditions again, turns a non-constructibility result\nwith a transcendental parameter into a non-constructibility result with a\nrational parameter.

In this paper, there is presented\na new approach for the continuous functions optimization with rotational\nmutation and crossover operator.

By\nsolving the conservation equation and applying the second law of\nthermodynamics, we show that direction of the energy transfer depends on the\nequation of state of the matter fluid. In particular, a phantom fluid should\nloose energy with expansion of the universe.

To obtain distinguishing trait and\nstrategic form of PD certain constraints are imposed on the elements of its\npayoff matrix. We quantize PD by generalized quantization scheme to analyze its\nstrategic behavior in quantum domain. The game starts with general entangled\nstate of the form $\\left}\\psi\\right\\rangle =\\cos\\frac{\\xi}%\n{2}\\left|00\\right\\rangle +i\\sin\\frac{\\xi}{2}\\left|11\\right\\rangle $ and the\nmeasurement for payoffs is performed in entangled and product bases. We show\nthat for both measurements there exist respective cutoff values of entanglement\nof initial quantum state up to which strategic form of game remains intact.\nBeyond these cutoffs the quantized PD behaves like chicken game up to another\ncutoff value.
