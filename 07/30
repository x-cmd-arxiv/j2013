In this paper we construct an\nassociated degeneration of homogeneous coordinate rings of classical flag\nvarieties in all types and show that these rings are Frobenius split in most\ntypes. It follows that the degenerate flag varieties of types $A_n$, $C_n$ and\n$G_2$ are Frobenius split. In particular we obtain an alternate proof of\nsplitting in types $A_n$ and $C_n$; the case $G_2$ was not previously known.

For 3He in an axially \"stretched\"\naerogel GL theory predicts a transition from normal liquid into a chiral ABM\nphase at T_c1 in which the chirality axis, l, is aligned along the strain axis.\nThis orbitally aligned state, is protected from random fluctuations in the\nanisotropy direction, has a positive NMR frequency shift, a sharp NMR resonance\nline and is identified with the high-temperature ESP-1 phase of superfluid 3He\nin axially stretched aerogel. A second transition into a biaxial phase is\npredicted to onset at a slightly lower temperature, T_c2 < T_c1. This phase is\nan ESP state, breaks time-reversal symmetry, and is defined by an orbital order\nparameter that spontaneously breaks axial rotation symmetry. This transition is\ndriven by the coupling of an axially aligned 1D \"polar\" order parameter to the\ntwo time-reversed 2D axial ABM states. The biaxial phase has a continuous\ndegeneracy associated with the projection of its chiral axis in the plane\nnormal to the anisotropy axis.

We investigate analytically and numerically the linear\nand non-linear visco-elastic response of these fragile solids by probing how\nshear fronts propagate through them. Our approach, that we tentatively label\nshear front rheology, provides an alternative route to standard oscillatory\nrheology. In the linear regime, we observe at late times a diffusive broadening\nof the fronts controlled by an effective shear viscosity that diverges at the\ncritical point. No matter how small the microscopic coefficient of dissipation,\nstrongly disordered networks behave as if they were over-damped because energy\nis irreversibly leaked into diverging non-affine fluctuations. Close to the\ntransition, the regime of linear response becomes vanishingly small: the\ntiniest shear strains generate strongly non-linear shear shock waves\nqualitatively different from their compressional counterparts in granular\nmedia.

Such contradictory\nobservations suggest that the stationary states be unstable. In this study we\ndevelop a new approach to investigate the stability property of traffic flow in\nthis and other networks. Based on the observation that kinematic waves\npropagate in a circular path when only one of the two intermediate links is\ncongested, we derive a one-dimensional, discrete Poincar\\'e map in the out-flux\nat a Poincar\\'e section. We then prove that the fixed points of the Poincar\\'e\nmap correspond to stationary flow-rates on the two links. With Lyapunov's first\nmethod, we demonstrate that the Poincar\\'e map can be finite-time stable,\nasymptotically stable, or unstable. When unstable, the map is found to have\nperiodical points of period two, but no chaotic solutions. Comparing the\nresults with those in existing studies, we conclude that the Poincar\\'e map can\nbe used to represent network-wide dynamics in the kinematic wave model. We\nfurther analyze the bifurcation in the stability of the Poincar\\'e map caused\nby varying route choice proportions.

Overall, our results indicate that non-disrupting neutron\nstar-black hole mergers are exceptionally well modeled by black hole-black hole\nmergers, and that given the absence of mass ejection, accretion disk formation,\nor differences in the gravitational wave signals, only electromagnetic\nprecursors could prove the presence of a neutron star in low-spin systems of\ntotal mass ~10Msun, at least until the advent of gravitational wave detectors\nwith a sensitivity comparable to that of the proposed Einstein Telescope.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jul 2013 19:11:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-18"}

However, there is no compelling evidence on\nwhether they also feed a central supermassive black hole: by measuring the\nfractions of barred active and inactive galaxies, previous studies have yielded\nconflicting results. In this paper, we aim to understand the lack of\nobservational evidence for bar-driven active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity by\nstudying a sample of 41 nearby (d < 35 Mpc) barred galaxies from the Spitzer\nSurvey for Stellar Structure in Galaxies. We use Chandra observations to\nmeasure nuclear 2--10 keV X-ray luminosities and estimate Eddington ratios,\ntogether with Spitzer 3.6um imaging to quantify the strength of the stellar bar\nin two independent ways: (1) from its structure, as traced by its ellipticity\nand boxiness, and (2) from its gravitational torque Q_b, taken as the maximum\nratio of the tangential force to the mean background radial force. In this way,\nrather than discretizing the presence of both stellar bars and nuclear\nactivity, we are able to account for the continuum of bar strengths and degrees\nof AGN activity. We find nuclear X-ray sources in 31 out of 41 galaxies with\nmedian X-ray luminosity and Eddington ratio of L_X=4.3x10^{38} erg/s and\nL_bol/L_Edd=6.9x10^{-6} respectively, consistent with low-luminosity AGN\nactivity. Including upper limits for those galaxies without nuclear detections,\nwe find no significant correlation between any of the bar strength indicators\nand the degree of nuclear activity, irrespective of galaxy luminosity, stellar\nmass, Hubble type, or bulge size. Strong bars do not favor brighter or more\nefficient nuclear activity, implying that at least for the low-luminosity\nregime, supermassive black hole fueling is not closely connected to large scale\nfeatures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jul 2013 20:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

Here, we use an extension of the SDRG framework to find a\nnon-universal anomalous dimension eta_{sd} characterizing the divergence of the\nsusceptibility with system size: chi ~ L^(2-eta_{sd}). We show that eta_{sd}\nobeys the hyperscaling relation eta_{sd} = 1/2K_{eff}. We also identify an\nimportant obstacle to measuring this exponent on finite-size systems and\ncomment on the implications for numerics and experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jul 2013 20:00:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-16"}

Interestingly\nhowever, work on these systems shows that even primitive forms of automated\noversight of the human planner does help in significantly improving the\neffectiveness of the humans/crowd.

The bottom\nline is that the bounds coming from the same sign di-lepton analysis are\ncomparable for our model and the simplified model studied assuming BR(gluino ->\nt tbar neutralino) = 100%. However the bounds coming from the purely hadronic\nanalyses for our model are 10 - 20% lower than obtained for the simplified\nmodels.

Witten's classic argument that\nbaryons and interacting systems of baryons can be described in a mean-field\napproximation with each of the quarks moving in an average potential due to the\nremaining quarks is heuristic. It is important to justify this heuristic\ndescription for the case of baryonic matter since systems of interacting\nbaryons are intrinsically more complicated than single baryons due to the\npossibility of hidden color states---states in which the subsystems making up\nthe entire baryon crystal are not color-singlet nucleons but rather colorful\nstates coupled together to make a color-singlet state. In this work, we provide\na formal justification of this heuristic prescription. In order to do this, we\nstart by taking the heavy quark limit, thus effectively reducing the problem to\na many-body quantum mechanical system. This problem can be formulated in terms\nof integrals over coherent states, which for this problem are simple Slater\ndeterminants. We show that for the many-body problem, the support region for\nthese integrals becomes narrow at large $N_c$, yielding an energy which is\nwell-approximated by a single coherent state---that is a mean-field\ndescription. Corrections to the energy are of relative order $1/N_c$. While\nhidden color states are present in the exact state of the heavy quark system,\nthey only influence the interaction energy at sub-leading order in $1/N_{c}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jul 2013 20:06:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-05"}

In this\npaper, we extend this modelling framework to certain classes of networks\nexhibiting loops. We show that closures where the loops are kept intact are\nexact, and lead to a simplified and numerically solvable system of ODEs\n(ordinary-differential-equations). The findings of the paper lead us to a\ngeneralisation of closures that are based on partitioning the network around\nnodes that are cut-vertices (i.e. the removal of such a node leads to the\nnetwork breaking down into at least two disjointed components or subnetworks).\nExploiting this structural property of the network yields some natural\nclosures, where the evolution of a particular state can typically be exactly\ngiven in terms of the corresponding or projected sates on the subnetworks and\nthe cut-vertex. A byproduct of this analysis is an alternative probabilistic\nproof of the exactness of the closures for tree-like networks presented in\nSharkey et al. [13]. In this paper we also elaborate on how the main result can\nbe applied to more realistic networks, for which we write down the ODEs\nexplicitly and compare output from these to results from simulation.\nFurthermore, we give a general, recipe-like method of how to apply the\nreduction by closures technique for arbitrary networks, and give an upper bound\non the maximum number of equations needed for an exact representation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jul 2013 20:49:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-31"}

Although interesting in their own\nright, giant resonances are also enormously valuable in providing stringent\nconstraints on the equation of state of asymmetric matter. We this view in\nmind, we focus on two modes of excitation that are essential in reaching this\ngoal: the isoscalar giant monopole resonance (GMR) and the isovector giant\ndipole resonance (GDR). GMR energies in heavy nuclei are sensitive to the\nsymmetry energy because they probe the incompressibility of neutron-rich\nmatter. Unfortunately, access to the symmetry energy is hindered by the\nrelatively low neutron-proton asymmetry of stable nuclei. Thus, the measurement\nof GMR energies in exotic nuclei is strongly encouraged.

Unfortunately, in practice functions often\ncontain noise and discretization artifacts causing their Jacobi set to become\nunmanageably large and complex. While there exist techniques to simplify Jacobi\nsets, these are unsuitable for most applications as they lack fine-grained\ncontrol over the process and heavily restrict the type of simplifications\npossible.\n  In this paper, we introduce a new framework that generalizes critical point\ncancellations in scalar functions to Jacobi sets in two dimensions.

This appears to suggest that the Jupiter side of the Sun is slightly\nbrighter during solar maxima. The effect is observed when the Earth crosses the\nSun-Jupiter conjunction line every 1.09 years.

Strong evidence is\nalso found for a 0.5-year TSI cycle that could be driven by the Earth's\ncrossing the solar equatorial plane twice a year and may indicate a latitudinal\nsolar-luminosity asymmetry. Because both spring and synodic planetary cycles\nappear to be present and the amplitudes of their TSI signatures appear enhanced\nduring sunspot cycle maxima, we conjecture that on annual and sub-annual scales\nboth gravitational and electro-magnetic planet-sun interactions and internal\nnon-linear feedbacks may be modulating solar activity.

Current population genomic\ntechniques are not well posed to identify such signals. In the past decade,\ndetailed knowledge about the specific loci underlying polygenic traits has\nbegun to emerge from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Here we combine\nthis knowledge from GWAS with robust population genetic modeling to identify\ntraits that may have been influenced by local adaptation. We exploit the fact\nthat GWAS provide an estimate of the additive effect size of many loci to\nestimate the mean additive genetic value for a given phenotype across many\npopulations as simple weighted sums of allele frequencies. We first describe a\ngeneral model of neutral genetic value drift for an arbitrary number of\npopulations with an arbitrary relatedness structure. Based on this model we\ndevelop methods for detecting unusually strong correlations between genetic\nvalues and specific environmental variables, as well as a generalization of\n$Q_{ST}/F_{ST}$ comparisons to test for over-dispersion of genetic values among\npopulations. Finally we lay out a framework to identify the individual\npopulations or groups of populations that contribute to the signal of\noverdispersion.

A main goal\nof this work is to clarify the statistical relevance of Levi-Civita curvature\ntensor $R_{ijkl}(x|\\theta)$ of the statistical manifold $\\mathcal{M}$. For this\npurpose, the notion of \\emph{irreducible statistical correlations} is\nintroduced.

The acceleration\ninvolves the parallel electric field that develops in the limit of inertial\nAlfv\\'en waves (IAWs). A two-potential model for IAWs is used to relate the\nparallel potential to the cross-field potential transported by the waves. We\nidentify a maximum parallel potential in terms of a maximum current density\nthat corresponds to the threshold for the onset of anomalous resistivity. This\nmaximum is of order $10\\,$kV when the threshold is that for the Buneman\ninstability. We argue that this restricts the cross-field potential in an\nAlfv\\'en wave to about $10\\,$kV.

The thin disk\nof the Galaxy is divided in two regions that are separated by a barrier\nsituated at that radius. Since the gas cannot get across that barrier, the\nchemical evolution is independent on the two sides of it. The barrier is caused\nby the opposite directions of flows of gas, on the two sides, in addition to a\nCassini-like ring void of HI (caused itself by the flows). A step in the\nmetallicity gradient developed at corotation, due to the difference in the\naverage star formation rate on the two sides, and to this lack of communication\nbetween them. In connection with this, a proof that the spiral arms of our\nGalaxy are long-lived (a few billion years) is the existence of this step.

For example, the identification of\nDE genes between distinct disease phenotypes is an important first step in\nunderstanding and developing treatment drugs for the disease. It can also\ncontribute significantly to the construction of a discriminant rule for\npredicting the class of origin of an unclassified tissue sample from a patient.\nWe present a novel approach to the problem of detecting DE genes that is based\non a test statistic formed as a weighted (normalized) cluster-specific contrast\nin the mixed effects of the mixture model used in the first instance to cluster\nthe gene profiles into a manageable number of clusters. The key factor in the\nformation of our test statistic is the use of gene-specific mixed effects in\nthe cluster-specific contrast. It thus means that the (soft) assignment of a\ngiven gene to a cluster is not crucial. This is because in addition to class\ndifferences between the (estimated) fixed effects terms for a cluster,\ngene-specific class differences also contribute to the cluster-specific\ncontributions to the final form of the test statistic. The proposed test\nstatistic can be used where the primary aim is to rank the genes in order of\nevidence against the null hypothesis of no DE.

Potentiation decay\nis the gradual, activity-independent reduction of synaptic weights over time.\nWe show that potentiation decay enables a dynamic and statistically stable\nnetwork connectivity when neurons spike spontaneously. Periodic stimulation of\na subset of neurons leads to formation of synfire chains through a random\nrecruitment process, which terminates when the chain connects to itself and\nforms a loop. We demonstrate that chain length distributions depend on the\npotentiation decay. Fast potentiation decay leads to long chains with wide\ndistributions, while slow potentiation decay leads to short chains with narrow\ndistributions. We suggest that the potentiation decay, which corresponds to the\ndecay of early long-term potentiation of synapses (E-LTP), is an important\nsynaptic plasticity rule in regulating formation of neural circuity through\nSTDP.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Jul 2013 02:17:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Aug 2013 00:45:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 26 Nov 2013 21:16:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

However, the availability of large-scale data,\nsuch as those from e-commerce and smart-phone communications, makes it possible\nto probe into and quantify the dynamics of human interest. Using three\nprototypical \"big data\" sets, we investigate the scaling behaviors associated\nwith human-interest dynamics.

Our method, when applied to optimizing the TM-score and the GDT\nscore, produces significantly better results than current state-of-the-art\nprotein structure alignment tools. Specifically, if the highest TM-score found\nby TMalign is lower than (0.6) and the highest TM-score found by one of the\ntested methods is higher than (0.5), there is a probability of (42%) that\nTMalign failed to find TM-scores higher than (0.5), while the same probability\nis reduced to (2%) if our method is used. This could significantly improve the\naccuracy of fold detection if the cutoff TM-score of (0.5) is used.\n  In addition, existing structure alignment algorithms focus on structure\nsimilarity alone and simply ignore other important similarities, such as\nsequence similarity. Our approach has the capacity to incorporate multiple\nsimilarities into the scoring function. Results show that sequence similarity\naids in finding high quality protein structure alignments that are more\nconsistent with eye-examined alignments in HOMSTRAD. Even when structure\nsimilarity itself fails to find alignments with any consistency with\neye-examined alignments, our method remains capable of finding alignments\nhighly similar to, or even identical to, eye-examined alignments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Jul 2013 03:44:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-31"}

Since CBTC systems are mostly deployed in underground\ntunnels and trains move in high speed, building a train-ground wireless\ncommunication system for CBTC is a challenging task. Modeling the tunnel\nchannels is very important to design and evaluate the performance of CBTC\nsystems. Most of existing works on channel modeling do not consider the unique\ncharacteristics in CBTC systems, such as high mobility speed, deterministic\nmoving direction, and accurate train location information.

In this thesis, we are concerned with the specific context of\nregular automated pentesting, and use the term \"attack planning\" in that sense.\nThe following three research directions are investigated.\n  First, we introduce a conceptual model of computer network attacks, based on\nan analysis of the penetration testing practices. We study how this attack\nmodel can be represented in the PDDL language. Then we describe an\nimplementation that integrates a classical planner with a penetration testing\ntool. This allows us to automatically generate attack paths for real world\npentesting scenarios, and to validate these attacks by executing them.\n  Secondly, we present efficient probabilistic planning algorithms,\nspecifically designed for this problem, that achieve industrial-scale runtime\nperformance (able to solve scenarios with several hundred hosts and exploits).\nThese algorithms take into account the probability of success of the actions\nand their expected cost (for example in terms of execution time, or network\ntraffic generated).\n  Finally, we take a different direction: instead of trying to improve the\nefficiency of the solutions developed, we focus on improving the model of the\nattacker. We model the attack planning problem in terms of partially observable\nMarkov decision processes (POMDP). This grounds penetration testing in a\nwell-researched formalism.

In this paper, we consider a\ncooperative network, consisting of one source node, one destination node, one\neavesdropper node, and a number of relay nodes. Specifically, the source may\nselect several relays to help forward the signal to the corresponding\ndestination to achieve the best security performance. However, the relays may\nhave the incentive not to report their true private channel information in\norder to get more chances to be selected and gain more payoff from the source.\nWe propose a Vickey-Clark-Grove (VCG) based mechanism and an\nArrow-d'Aspremont-Gerard-Varet (AGV) based mechanism into the investigated\nrelay network to solve this cheating problem. In these two different\nmechanisms, we design different \"transfer payment\" functions to the payoff of\neach selected relay and prove that each relay gets its maximum (expected)\npayoff when it truthfully reveals its private channel information to the\nsource.

Hence, it is interesting to study the combined evolutionary history\nof multiple species, their genes, and the environment they live in. A common\napproach to address this research problem is to describe each individual\nevolution as a phylogenetic tree and construct a tree reconciliation which is\nparsimonious with respect to a given event model. Unfortunately, most of the\nprevious approaches are designed only either for host-parasite systems, for\ngene tree/species tree reconciliation, or biogeography. Hence, a method is\ndesirable, which addresses the general problem of mapping phylogenetic trees\nand covering all varieties of coevolving systems, including e.g., predator-prey\nand symbiotic relationships. To overcome this gap, we introduce a generalized\ncophylogenetic event model considering the combinatorial complete set of local\ncoevolutionary events.

This semiclassical approach bridges the\ngap between the drift-diffusion and ballistic (\"thermionic\") models of carrier\ntransport, whose validity is limited to the range of very small and very large\nvalues, respectively, of the carrier mean free path. The physical concept\nunderlying the thermoballistic approach, while incorporating basic features of\nthe drift-diffusion and ballistic descriptions, constitutes a novel, unifying\nscheme. It is based on the introduction of \"ballistic configurations\" defined\nby a random partitioning of the length of a semiconducting sample into\nballistic transport intervals, which are linked by points of local\nthermodynamic equilibrium at which carriers are emitted or absorbed. By\naveraging the carrier currents in the ballistic intervals over all ballistic\nconfigurations, a position-dependent thermoballistic current is derived for\narbitrary magnitude of the carrier mean free path. This current is the key\nelement of the thermoballistic concept and forms the point of departure of the\ncalculation of various transport quantities. The present article starts out\nwith an account of the standard drift-diffusion and ballistic transport models,\nand of a prototype model which paves the way for the fully developed form of\nthat concept. In the main body of the article, a coherent exposition of the\nthermoballistic approach is given within a general formulation that takes into\naccount arbitrarily shaped, spin-split potential energy profiles and spin\nrelaxation during the carrier motion across ballistic intervals. The\ncalculational procedures devised for implementing the thermoballistic concept\nare described. Specific examples relevant to present-day semiconductor and\nspintronics research are considered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Jul 2013 08:25:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-31"}

For this reason,\nhaving precise metallicities is very important. Different methods can provide\ndifferent results that lead to discrepancies in the analysis of planet hosts.\nTo study the impact of different analyses on the metallicity scale for evolved\nstars, we compare different iron line lists to use in the atmospheric parameter\nderivation of evolved stars. Therefore, we use a sample of 71 evolved stars\nwith planets. With these new homogeneous parameters, we revisit the metallicity\n- giant planet connection for evolved stars. A spectroscopic analysis based on\nKurucz models in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) was performed through\nthe MOOG code to derive the atmospheric parameters. Two different iron line\nlist sets were used, one built for cool FGK stars in general, and the other for\ngiant FGK stars. Masses were calculated through isochrone fitting, using the\nPadova models. Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests (K-S tests) were then performed on the\nmetallicity distributions of various different samples of evolved stars and red\ngiants. All parameters compare well using a line list set, designed\nspecifically for cool and solar-like stars to provide more accurate\ntemperatures. All parameters derived with this line list set are preferred and\nare thus adopted for future analysis. We find that evolved planet hosts are\nmore metal-poor than dwarf stars with giant planets. However, a bias in giant\nstellar samples that are searched for planets is present. Because of a colour\ncut-off, metal-rich low-gravity stars are left out of the samples, making it\nhard to compare dwarf stars with giant stars. Furthermore, no metallicity\nenhancement is found for red giants with planets ($\\log g < 3.0$\\,dex) with\nrespect to red giants without planets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Jul 2013 08:42:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

The emergence of third generation sequencing (Pacific\nBiosciences) with long reads enables the opportunity to resolve complicated\nrepeats that could not be resolved by the short read data. However, these long\nreads have high error rate and it is an uphill task to assemble the genome\nwithout using additional high quality short reads. Recently, Koren et al. 2012\nproposed an approach to use high quality short reads data to correct these long\nreads and, thus, make the assembly from long reads possible. However, due to\nthe large size of both dataset (short and long reads), error-correction of\nthese long reads requires excessively high computational resources, even on\nsmall bacterial genomes. In this work, instead of error correction of long\nreads, we first assemble the short reads and later map these long reads on the\nassembly graph to resolve repeats.\n  Contribution: We present a hybrid assembly approach that is both\ncomputationally effective and produces high quality assemblies. Our algorithm\nfirst operates with a simplified version of the assembly graph consisting only\nof long contigs and gradually improves the assembly by adding smaller contigs\nin each iteration. In contrast to the state-of-the-art long reads error\ncorrection technique, which requires high computational resources and long\nrunning time on a supercomputer even for bacterial genome datasets, our\nsoftware can produce comparable assembly using only a standard desktop in a\nshort running time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Jul 2013 12:05:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-31"}

The data consisting of detailed high\nangular-resolution images (with beam-width ~20 milli-arc-seconds) of several\ndozen OH maser sources or \"spots\", at 1612, 1665 and 1667 MHz, reveal\nanisotropic scatter broadening, with typical sizes of a few tens of\nmilli-arc-seconds and axial ratios between 1.5 to 3. Such anisotropies have\nbeen reported earlier by Desai, Gwinn & Diamond (1994) and interpreted as\ninduced by the local magnetic field parallel to the Galactic plane. However, we\nfind a) the apparent angular sizes on the average a factor of ~2.5 less than\nthose reported by Desai et al. (1994), indicating significantly less scattering\nthan inferred earlier, and b) a significant deviation in the average\norientation of the scatter-broadened images (by ~10 degrees) from that implied\nby the magnetic field in the Galactic plane.

Here we present\npreviously unpublished data taken around the start of activity of the comet in\n2007/8, before its last perihelion passage. We constrain the time of the start\nof activity, and combine this with other data taken throughout the comet's\norbit to make predictions for its likely behaviour during 2014/5 while Rosetta\nis operating. A considerable difficulty in observing 67P during the past years\nhas been its position against crowded fields towards the Galactic centre for\nmuch of the time. The 2007/8 data presented here were particularly difficult,\nand the comet will once again be badly placed for Earth-based observations in\n2014/5. We make use of the difference image analysis (DIA) technique, which is\ncommonly used in variable star and exoplanet research, to remove background\nsources and extract images of the comet. In addition, we reprocess a large\nquantity of archival images of 67P covering its full orbit, to produce a\nheliocentric lightcurve. By using consistent reduction, measurement and\ncalibration techniques we generate a remarkably clean lightcurve, which can be\nused to measure a brightness-distance relationship and to predict the future\nbrightness of the comet. We determine that the comet was active around November\n2007, at a pre-perihelion distance from the Sun of 4.3 AU. The comet will reach\nthis distance, and probably become active again, in March 2014. We find that\nthe dust brightness can be well described by Af\\rho \\propto r^-3.2\npre-perihelion and r^-3.4 post-perihelion, and that the comet has a higher\ndust-to-gas ratio than average.

To\nunderstand the structure evolution of dust aggregates is a key in the\nplanetesimal formation. Dust grains become fluffy by coagulation in\nprotoplanetary disks. However, once they become fluffy, they are not\nsufficiently compressed by collisional compression to form compact\nplanetesimals. Aims: We aim to reveal the pathway of the dust structure\nevolution from dust grains to compact planetesimals. Methods: Using the\ncompressive strength formula, we analytically investigate how fluffy dust\naggregates are compressed by static compression due to ram pressure of the disk\ngas and self gravity of the aggregates in protoplanetary disks. Results: We\nreveal the pathway of the porosity evolution from dust grains via fluffy\naggregates to form planetesimals, circumventing the barriers in planetesimal\nformation. The aggregates are compressed by the disk gas to the density of\n10^{-3} g/cm^3 in coagulation, which is more compact than the case with\ncollisional compression. Then, they are compressed more by self gravity to\n10^{-1} g/cm^3 when the radius is 10 km. Although the gas compression\ndecelerate the growth, they grow enough rapidly to avoid the radial drift\nbarrier when the orbital radius is < 6 AU in a typical disk. Conclusions: We\npropose fluffy dust growth scenario from grains to planetesimals. It enables\nthe icy planetesimal formation in a wide range beyond the snowline in\nprotoplanetary disks. This result proposes a concrete initial condition of\nplanetesimals for the later stages of the planet formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Jul 2013 14:04:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 Aug 2013 13:16:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

In both galaxies the TH emission is\nlinearly correlated with the emission from warm dust (24 \\mu m, 70 \\mu m), but\nthe power laws of the NTH-FIR correlations have exponents b < 1 that increase\nwith increasing frequency. Furthermore, the values of b for M33 are\nsignificantly smaller (b ~ 0.4) than those for M31 (b ~ 0.6). We interpret the\ndifferences in b as differences in the diffusion length of the CRE. We estimate\nthe diffusion length in two ways: (1) by smoothing the NTH emission at the\nhigher frequency until the correlation with NTH emission at 1.4 GHz has b = 1,\nand (2) by smoothing the TH emission until the correlation with the NTH\nemission at the same frequency has b = 1, assuming that the TH emission\nrepresents the source distribution of the CRE.
