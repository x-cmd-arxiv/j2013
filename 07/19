They have never been observed,\nbut this fact is enough to constrain the amplitude of fluctuations on very\nsmall scales which cannot be otherwise probed. Because PBHs form only in very\nrare large fluctuations, the number of PBHs formed is extremely sensitive to\nchanges in the shape of the tail of the fluctuation distribution - which\ndepends on the amount of non-Gaussianity present. We first study how local\nnon-Gaussianity of arbitrary size up to fifth order affects the abundance and\nconstraints from PBHs, finding that they depend strongly on even small amounts\nof non-Gaussianity and the upper bound on the allowed amplitude of the power\nspectrum can vary by several orders of magnitude. The sign of the non-linearity\nparameters (f_{NL}, g_{NL}, etc) are particularly important. We also study the\nabundance and constraints from PBHs in the curvaton scenario, in which case the\ncomplete non-linear probability distribution is known, and find that truncating\nto any given order (i.e. to order f_{NL} or g_{NL}, etc) does not give accurate\nresults.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Jul 2013 16:06:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 Sep 2013 18:46:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-20"}

Our new method, named\nGALFITM, extends GALFIT3's current single-band fitting process by\nsimultaneously using multiple images of the same galaxy to constrain a\nwavelength-dependent model. Each standard profile parameter may vary as a\nfunction of wavelength, with a user-definable degree of smoothness, from\nconstant to fully free. The performance of GALFITM is evaluated by fitting\nelliptical S\\'ersic profiles to ugriz imaging data for 4026 galaxies,\ncomprising the original SDSS imaging for 163 low redshift (v < 7000 kms)\ngalaxies and 3863 artificially redshifted (0.01 < z < 0.25) images of the same\ngalaxies.\n  Comparing results from single-band and multi-band techniques, we show that\nGALFITM significantly improves the extraction of information, particularly from\nbands with low signal-to-noise ratio (e.g., u and z SDSS bands) when combined\nwith higher signal-to-noise images. We also study systematic trends in the\nrecovered parameters, particularly S\\'ersic index, that appear when one\nperforms measurements of the same galaxies at successively higher redshifts. We\nargue that it is vital that studies investigating the evolution of galaxy\nstructure are careful to avoid or correct for these biases.\n  The resulting multi-band photometric structural parameters for our sample of\n163 galaxies are provided. We demonstrate the importance of considering\nmulti-band measurements by showing that the S\\'ersic indices of spiral galaxies\nincrease to redder wavelengths, as expected for composite bulge-disk systems.\nFinally, for the ellipticals in our sample, which should be well-represented by\nsingle-S\\'ersic models, we compare our measured parameters to those from\nprevious studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Jul 2013 16:10:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

Using Fresnel diffraction formula and\nnumerical computations, we investigate the influence of a slight longitudinal\nmispositioning of the CCD camera.

The existence of this phenomenon\nhas important consequences for the design and the realization of experiments in\nthe field of optical wave turbulence in which equilibrium spectra reached by\nincoherent waves can only be determined from a careful far-field analysis.

However, outliers in the data due to\ninterference or due to errors in the sky model would have adverse effects on\nprocessing based on a Gaussian noise model. Most of the shortcomings of\ncalibration such as the loss in flux or coherence, and the appearance of\nspurious sources, could be attributed to the deviations of the underlying noise\nmodel. In this paper, we propose to improve the robustness of calibration by\nusing a noise model based on Student's t distribution. Student's t noise is a\nspecial case of Gaussian noise when the variance is unknown. Unlike Gaussian\nnoise model based calibration, traditional least squares minimization would not\ndirectly extend to a case when we have a Student's t noise model. Therefore, we\nuse a variant of the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm, called the\nExpectation-Conditional Maximization Either (ECME) algorithm when we have a\nStudent's t noise model and use the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm in the\nmaximization step.

Wolf-Rayet stars are the\nmost plausible LGRB progenitors, since the free-fall time of the envelope is\nconsistent with the duration, and the natural outcome of the progenitor is a\nType Ic SN. While a new population of ultra-long GRBs (ULGRBs), GRB 111209A,\nGRB 101225A, and GRB 121027A, has a duration of ~ 10^4 s, two of them are\naccompanied by superluminous-supernova (SLSN) like bumps, which are <~ 10 times\nbrighter than typical hypernovae. Wolf-Rayet progenitors cannot explain ULGRBs\nbecause of too long duration and too bright SN-like bump. A blue supergiant\n(BSG) progenitor model, however, can explain the duration of ULGRBs. Moreover,\nSLSN-like bump can be attributed to the so-called cocoon-fireball photospheric\nemissions (CFPEs). Since a large cocoon is inevitably produced during the\nrelativistic jet piercing though the BSG envelope, this component can be a\nsmoking-gun evidence of BSG model for ULGRBs. In this paper, we examine u, g,\nr, i, and J-band light curves of three ULGRBs and demonstrate that they can be\nfitted quite well by our BSG model with the appropriate choices of the jet\nopening angle and the number density of the ambient gas. In addition, we\npredict that for 121027A, SLSN-like bump could have been observed for ~ 20 - 80\ndays after the burst. We also propose that some SLSNe might be CFPEs of\noff-axis ULGRBs without visible prompt emission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Jul 2013 19:59:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 5 Oct 2013 14:31:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

Numerous proposals for such modified gravity\ncosmologies exist, but often their consequences for structure formation in the\nnon-linear sector are not yet accurately known. In this work, we employ\nhigh-resolution numerical simulations of f(R)-gravity models coupled with a\nsemi-analytic model (SAM) for galaxy formation to obtain detailed predictions\nfor the evolution of galaxy properties. The f(R)-gravity models imply the\nexistence of a `fifth-force', which is however locally suppressed, preserving\nthe successes of general relativity on solar system scales. We show that dark\nmatter haloes in f(R)-gravity models are characterized by a modified virial\nscaling with respect to the LCDM scenario, reflecting a higher dark matter\nvelocity dispersion at a given mass. This effect is taken into account in the\nSAM by an appropriate modification of the mass--temperature relation. We find\nthat the statistical properties predicted for galaxies (such as the stellar\nmass function and the cosmic star formation rate) in f(R)-gravity show\ngenerally only very small differences relative to LCDM, smaller than the\ndispersion between the results of different SAM models, which can be viewed as\na measure of their systematic uncertainty. We also demonstrate that galaxy bias\nis not able to disentangle between f(R)-gravity and the standard cosmological\nscenario. However, f(R)-gravity imprints modifications in the linear growth\nrate of cosmic structures at large scale, which can be recovered from the\nstatistical properties of large galaxy samples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Jul 2013 20:00:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

In\nIRAS F15107+0724, the satellite lines are partially conjugate, as 1720 MHz\nabsorption and 1612 MHz emission have the same structure at some velocities\nwithin the source, along with additional broader 1612 MHz emission. This is the\nfirst observed example of conjugate satellite lines in an OHM. In the remaining\nsources, no satellite line emission is observed. The detections and upper\nlimits are generally consistent with models of OHM emission in which all of the\n18 cm OH lines have the same excitation temperature. There is no evidence for a\nsignificant population of strong satellite line emitters among OHMs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Jul 2013 20:07:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-16"}

Recently, a new paradigm has emerged with the advent of\nsymmetry-protected surface states on the boundary of topological insulators,\nenabling the creation of electronic systems with novel properties. For example,\ntime reversal symmetry (TRS) endows the massless charge carriers on the surface\nof a three-dimensional topological insulator with helicity, locking the\norientation of their spin relative to their momentum. Weakly breaking this\nsymmetry generates a gap on the surface, resulting in charge carriers with\nfinite effective mass and exotic spin textures. Analogous manipulations of the\none-dimensional boundary states of a two-dimensional topological insulator are\nalso possible, but have yet to be observed in the leading candidate materials.\nHere, we demonstrate experimentally that charge neutral monolayer graphene\ndisplays a new type of quantum spin Hall (QSH) effect, previously thought to\nexist only in TRS topological insulators, when it is subjected to a very large\nmagnetic field angled with respect to the graphene plane. Unlike in the TRS\ncase, the QSH presented here is protected by a spin-rotation symmetry that\nemerges as electron spins in a half-filled Landau level are polarized by the\nlarge in-plane magnetic field. The properties of the resulting helical edge\nstates can be modulated by balancing the applied field against an intrinsic\nantiferromagnetic instability, which tends to spontaneously break the\nspin-rotation symmetry. In the resulting canted antiferromagnetic (CAF) state,\nwe observe transport signatures of gapped edge states, which constitute a new\nkind of one-dimensional electronic system with tunable band gap and associated\nspin-texture.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Jul 2013 00:18:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-12"}

The\nsimplest interpretation of our observations favours some internal Faraday\nrotation, implying that Faraday rotation-driven conversion of LP to CP is the\ndominant CP generation mechanism. In this case, a small amount of\nvector-ordered magnetic field along the jet axis is required, along with\ninternal Faraday rotation from the low energy end of the relativistic electron\nenergy spectrum in an electron-proton dominated jet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Jul 2013 03:56:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

In the radiation dominated era, PBHs are surrounded by a\nroughly homogeneous cosmic plasma which endows photons with an effective mass\nthrough the plasma frequency. In this setting, spinning PBHs are unstable to a\nspontaneous spindown through the well-known \"black-hole bomb\" mechanism. At\nlinear level, the photon density is trapped by the effective photon mass and\ngrows exponentially in time due to superradiance. As the plasma density\ndeclines due to cosmic expansion, the associated energy around PBHs is released\nand dissipated in the CMB. We evaluate the resulting spectral distortions of\nthe CMB in the redshift range 10^3 < z < 2x10^6. Using the existing COBE/FIRAS\nbounds on CMB spectral distortions, we derive upper limits on the fraction of\ndark matter that can be associated with spinning PBHs in the mass range\n10^{-8}*Msun < M < 0.2*Msin.

However, within the past 20 years Lapidus has initiated and\npioneered a systematic study of tube formulas for fractal sets. Following this,\nit is natural to ask to what extend it is possible to develop a theory of\nmultifractal tube formulas for multifractal measures. In this paper we propose\nand develop a framework for such a theory. Firstly, we define multifractal tube\nformulas and, more generally, multifractal tube measures for general\nmultifractal measures. Secondly, we introduce and develop two approaches for\nanalysing these concepts for self-similar multifractal measures, namely:\n  (1) Multifractal tubes of self-similar measures and renewal theory. Using\ntechniques from renewal theory we give a complete description of the asymptotic\nbehaviour of the multifractal tube formulas and tube measures of self-similar\nmeasures satisfying the Open Set Condition.\n  (2) Multifractal tubes of self-similar measures and zeta-functions.\nUnfortunately, renewal theory techniques do not yield \"explicit\" expressions\nfor the functions describing the asymptotic behaviour of the multifractal tube\nformulas and tube measures of self-similar measures. This is clearly\nundesirable. For this reason, we introduce and develop a second framework for\nstudying multifractal tube formulas of self-similar measures. This approach is\nbased on multifractal zeta-functions and allow us obtain \"explicit\" expressions\nfor the multifractal tube formulas of self-similar measures, namely, using the\nMellin transform and the residue theorem, we are able to express the\nmultifractal tube formulas as sums involving the residues of the zeta-function.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Jul 2013 14:09:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-26"}

Of the three effects, the latter two lead to a midplane\nballooning feature of the filament, whilst the former leads to a ballooning\naround the X-points. In simulations containing all three effects the filament\nis observed to balloon at the midplane, suggesting that the role of curvature\nvariation is sub-dominant to the flux expansion and magnetic shear. The\nmagnitudes of these effects are all strongest near the X-point which leads to\nthe formation of parallel density gradients. The filaments simulated, which\nrepresent filaments in MAST, are identified as resistive ballooning, meaning\nthat their motion is inertially limited, not sheath limited. Parallel density\ngradients can drive the filament towards a Boltzmann response when the\ncollisionalityof the plasma is low. The results here show that the formation of\nparallel density gradients is a natural and inevitable consequence of a\nrealistic magnetic geometry and therefore the transition to the Boltzmann\nresponse is a consequence of the use of realistic magnetic geometry. The\nBoltzmann response causes the filament to self-organise and spin on an axis.\nThe transition from interchange motion to the Boltzmann response occurs with\nincreasing temperature through a decrease in collisionality. This is confirmed\nby measuring the correlation between density and potential perturbations within\nthe filament, which is low in the anti-symmetric state associated with the\ninterchange mechanism, but high in the Boltzmann regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Jul 2013 14:37:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

Such contemporaneous studies in supermassive black\nholes (SMBH) are harder to perform, as viscous times scale linearly with mass.\nHowever, as NGC 4395 is the lowest known mass Seyfert galaxy, we have used it\nto examine the simultaneous X-ray (Swift) and radio (VLA) correlation in a SMBH\nin a reasonably timed observing campaign. We find that the intrinsic X-ray\nvariability is stronger than the radio variability, and that the fluxes are\nonly weakly or tentatively coupled, similar to prior results obtained in NGC\n4051.

For non-negative integer and\nhalf-integer l both superalgebras admit a consistent truncation with a\n(different) finite number of generators. The real N=2 case coincides with the\nsuperalgebra introduced by Masterov, while the chiral N=2 case is a new\nsuperalgebra. We present D-module representations of both superalgebras. Then\nwe investigate the new superalgebra derived from the chiral supermultiplet. It\nis shown that it admits two types of central extensions, one is found for any d\nand half-integer l and the other only for d=2 and integer l. For each central\nextension the centrally extended l-superconformal Galilei algebra is realized\nin terms of its super-Heisenberg subalgebra generators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Jul 2013 15:33:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-23"}

The calculations were made within the PSS method in\nwhich the three-body wavefunction is expanded in eigenfunctions of a two-\ncentre Coulomb problem formulated in the Jacobi coordinates of the entrance\nchannel. This approach provides the asymptotically correct description of this\nchannel: the correct dissociation limit is obtained, there are no spurious\nlong-range interactions, the polarization attraction appears naturally, the\nelectron screening can be easily taken into account. The defects of the\ndescription are removed into the muon transfer channel in which their effect is\nnot expected to be too significant because of large kinetic energies there. The\nprevious calculations carried out in this way allowed one to explain\nexperimentally observed features of the temperature dependence of the transfer\nrate in hydrogen-neon mixtures. In the present work, a more perfect algorithm\nof constructing the basis eigenfunctions has been realized and a better\nagreement with experimental data has been obtained.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Jul 2013 15:58:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-22"}

The prime motive is to formulate a system which would give optimum\nperformance in terms of complexity, accuracy, delay and memory requirements for\nmobile environment. The speech to text converter consists of two stages namely\nfront-end analysis and pattern recognition. The front end analysis involves\npreprocessing and feature extraction. The traditional voice activity detection\nalgorithms which track only energy cannot successfully identify potential\nspeech from input because the unwanted part of the speech also has some energy\nand appears to be speech. In the proposed system, VAD that calculates energy of\nhigh frequency part separately as zero crossing rate to differentiate noise\nfrom speech is used. Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC) is used as\nfeature extraction method and Generalized Regression Neural Network is used as\nrecognizer. MFCC provides low word error rate and better feature extraction.\nNeural Network improves the accuracy. Thus a small database containing all\npossible syllable pronunciation of the user is sufficient to give recognition\naccuracy closer to 100%. Thus the proposed technique entertains realization of\nreal time speaker independent applications like mobile phones, PDAs etc.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Jul 2013 05:27:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-23"}
