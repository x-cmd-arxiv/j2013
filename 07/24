Recently it was\ndemonstrated that fractional Brownian motion and fractional Langevin equation\nmotion under external confinement are transiently non-ergodic---time and\nensemble averages behave differently---from the moment when the particle starts\nto sense the confinement. Here we show that these processes also exhibit\ntransient ageing, that is, physical observables such as the time averaged mean\nsquared displacement depend on the time lag between the initiation of the\nsystem at time $t=0$ and the start of the measurement at the ageing time $t_a$.\nIn particular, it turns out that for fractional Langevin equation motion the\nageing dependence on $t_a$ is different between the cases of free and confined\nmotion. We obtain explicit analytical expressions for the aged moments of the\nparticle position as well as the time averaged mean squared displacement and\npresent a numerical analysis of this transient ageing phenomenon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Jul 2013 16:02:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

Antimicrobial peptides (AMP) occur as\nimportant defence agents in many organisms and offer a viable alternative to\nconventional antibiotics. Therefore they have become increasingly recognized in\ncurrent research as templates for prospective antibiotic agents. The efficient\ndesigning of the new antimicrobials on the basis of antimicrobial peptides\nrequires comprehensive knowledge on those general physical-chemical\ncharacteristics which allow to differ antimicrobial peptides from non-active\nagainst microbs ones. According to supposed mechanisms of action, AMP interact\nwith and physically disrupt the bacterial membranes. Consequently,\nhydrophobicity, amphiphilicity and intrinsic aggregation propensities are\nconsidered as such major characteristics of the peptide, which determine the\nresults of peptide-membrane interactions. For some kind of peptides such\ncharacteristics as hydrophobicity, amphiphilicity and aggregation bias\ndetermines their ability to compose transmembrane domain of the membrane\nprotein, whilst for others the same properties are respond for their\nantimicrpobial activity, i.e. give them ability of membrane permeability and\nits damage. In this review we analyze the data about hydrophobicity,\namphiphilicity and intrinsic aggregation propensities available in literature\nin order to compare antimicrobial and transmembrane peptides and show what is\nthe common and what is the difference in this respect between them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Jul 2013 17:11:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-24"}

We find that these observables show universal behaviour in large\nclasses of theories.

Recently, Gezari et al. reported a discovery of a\nnew class of tidal disruption events: the disruption of a helium-rich stellar\ncore, thought to be a remnant of a red giant (RG) star. Motivated by this\ndiscovery and in anticipation of others, we consider tidal interaction of an RG\nstar with a supermassive black hole (SMBH) which leads to the stripping of the\nstellar envelope and subsequent inspiral of the compact core toward the black\nhole. Once the stellar envelope is removed the inspiral of the core is driven\nby tidal heating as well as the emission of gravitational radiation until the\ncore either falls into the SMBH or is tidally disrupted. In the case of tidal\ndisruption candidate PS1-10jh we find that there is a set of orbital solutions\nat high eccentricities in which the tidally stripped hydrogen envelope is\naccreted by the SMBH before the helium core is disrupted. This places the RG\ncore in a portion of parameter space where strong tidal heating can lift the\ndegeneracy of the compact remnant and disrupt it before it reaches the tidal\nradius. We consider how this sequence of events explains the puzzling absence\nof the hydrogen emission lines from the spectrum of PS1-10jh and gives rise to\nits other observational features.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Jul 2013 18:00:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 Jun 2014 18:57:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-20"}

The large variety of\nnuclear matter properties, such as the symmetry energy, which are covered by\nthese EOSs leads to distinct outcomes in supernova simulations. Many of the\ncurrently used EOS models can be ruled out by nuclear experiments, nuclear\nmany-body calculations, and observations of neutron stars. In particular the\ntwo classical supernova EOS describe neutron matter poorly. Nevertheless, we\nexplore their impact in supernova simulations since they are commonly used in\nastrophysics. They serve as extremely soft and stiff representative nuclear\nmodels. The corresponding supernova simulations represent two extreme cases,\ne.g., with respect to the protoneutron star (PNS) compactness and shock\nevolution. Moreover, in multi-dimensional supernova simulations EOS differences\nhave a strong effect on the explosion dynamics. Because of the extreme\nbehaviors of the classical supernova EOSs we also include DD2, a relativistic\nmean field EOS with density-dependent couplings, which is in satisfactory\nagreement with many current nuclear and observational constraints. This is the\nfirst time that DD2 is applied to supernova simulations and compared with the\nclassical supernova EOS. We find that the overall behaviour of the latter EOS\nin supernova simulations lies in between the two extreme classical EOSs.

The average physical properties of this circumgalactic medium\n(CGM) are determined by combining average absorption and emission measurements\nalong several extragalactic sightlines. However, there is a wide distribution\nof both, the halo emission measure and the \\ovii column density, suggesting\nthat the Galactic warm-hot gaseous halo is anisotropic.

Therefore the densities and pathlengths in the two\ndirections must be different, providing a suggestive evidence that the warm-hot\ngas in the CGM of the Milky Way is not distributed uniformly. However, the\nformal errors on derived parameters are too large to make such a claim. The\naverage density and pathlength of the two sightlines are similar to the global\naverages, so the halo mass is still huge, over 10 billion solar masses.

We\nfind that although low-metallicity environments will have hotter disk\ntemperatures on average, the temperature change alone cannot account for the\ndiscrepancy in the frequency of Balmer jumps between low-metallicity and\nsolar-metallicity stellar populations. Second, we investigate the effect of\nincluding a global one-armed oscillation in the gas density distribution of the\nmodeled disk.

The energy\nspectra are found to follow the $-$3 scaling at length scales smaller than the\nsize of the bubbles for bubbly flows. This $-$3 spectrum scaling holds not only\nin the well-established case of pseudo-turbulence, but surprisingly in all\ncases where bubbles are present in the system ($b > 0$). Therefore, it is a\ngeneric feature of turbulent bubbly flows, and the bubblance parameter is\nprobably not a suitable parameter to characterise the energy spectrum in bubbly\nturbulent flows. The physical reason is that the energy input by the bubbles\npasses over only to higher wave numbers, and the energy production due to the\nbubbles can be directly balanced by the viscous dissipation in the bubble wakes\nas suggested by Lance $\\&$ Bataille (1991). In addition, we provide an\nalternative explanation by balancing the energy production of the bubbles with\nviscous dissipation in the Fourier space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Jul 2013 21:48:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 Jan 2016 05:52:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-19"}

This\nbecomes evident when studying different spatial scales within galaxies. We\ninvestigate the correlation between the infrared (IR) and free-free/synchrotron\nradio continuum emission at 20 cm from the two local group galaxies M31 and M33\non spatial scales between 0.4 and 10 kpc. The multi-scale radio-IR correlations\nhave been carried out using a wavelet analysis. The free-free and IR emission\nare correlated on all scales, but on some scales the synchrotron emission is\nonly marginally correlated with the IR emission. The synchrotron-IR correlation\nis stronger in M33 than in M31 on small scales (<1 kpc), but it is weaker than\nin M31 on larger scales. Taking the smallest scale on which the synchrotron-IR\ncorrelation exists as the propagation length of cosmic ray electrons, we show\nthat the difference on small scales can be explained by the smaller propagation\nlength in M33 than in M31. On large scales, the difference is due to the thick\ndisk/halo in M33, which is absent in M31. A comparison of our data with data on\nNGC6946, the LMC and M51 suggests that the propagation length is determined by\nthe ratio of ordered-to-turbulent magnetic field strength, which is consistent\nwith diffusion of CR electrons in the ISM. As the diffusion length of CR\nelectrons influences the radio-IR correlation, this dependence is a direct\nobservational evidence of the importance of magnetic fields for the radio-IR\ncorrelation within galaxies. The star formation rate per surface area only\nindirectly influences the diffusion length as it increases the strength of the\nturbulent magnetic field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Jul 2013 21:51:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 28 Jul 2013 09:43:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

We find that in a parallel magnetic field, the resistance of the\nsample, R(I_DC), is asymmetric with respect to the direction of the DC current.\nThe asymmetry becomes stronger with an increase of either the magnetic field or\nthe difference between n_1 and n_2. These observations are interpreted in terms\nof the effective spin injection: the degree of spin polarisation is different\nin the two parts of the sample, implying different magnitudes of spin current\naway from the slot. The carriers thus leave the excess spin (of the appropriate\nsign) in the region around the slot, leading to spin accumulation (or\ndepletion) and to the spin drift-diffusion phenomena. Due to the positive\nmagnetoresistance of the two-dimensional electron gas, this change in a local\nmagnetisation affects the resistivity near the slot and the measured net\nresistance, giving rise to an asymmetric contribution. We further observe that\nthe value of R(I_DC) saturates at large I_DC; we suggest that this is due to\nelectron tunnelling from the two-dimensional n-type layer into the p-type\nsilicon (or into another \"spin reservoir\") at the slot.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Jul 2013 22:21:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 Sep 2013 18:00:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-21"}

Eccentricities, primary masses, and mass\nratios of BBH escapers are independent of N. Using this dependence of BBH\nproperties, we have artificially generated a population of BBH escapers from a\nGC with N ~ 10^6, and have estimated a detection rate of mergers of BBH\nescapers by next-generation GW observatories. We have assumed that all the GCs\nare formed 10 or 12Gyrs ago with their initial numbers of stars N_i=5 x 10^5 --\n2 x 10^6 and their initial stellar mass densities inside their half-mass radii\n\\rho_h,i=6 x 10^3 -- 10^6M_sun pc^-3. Then, the detection rate of BBH escapers\nis 0.5 -- 20 yr^-1 for a BH retention fraction R_BH=0.5. A few BBH escapers are\ncomponents of hierarchical triple systems, although we do not consider secular\nperturbation on such BBH escapers for our estimate. Our simulations have shown\nthat BHs are still inside some of GCs at the present day. These BHs may\nmarginally contribute to BBH detection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Jul 2013 23:38:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

This empirical spectral library was used to\ntrain ANNs, yielding an accuracy of 0.3 dex in [Fe/H], 200 K in temperature,\nand 0.3 dex in log g. We found that the independent calibrations of near-solar\nmetallicity stars and metal-poor stars decreases the errors in T_eff and log g\nby nearly a factor of two. We calculated T_eff, log g, and [Fe/H] on a\nconsistent scale for a large number of field stars and candidate metal-poor\nstars. We extended the application of this method to the calibration of\nabsolute magnitudes using nearby stars with well-estimated parallaxes. A better\ncalibration accuracy for M_V could be obtained by training separate ANNs for\ncool, warm, and metal-poor stars. The current accuracy of M_V calibration is\n(+-)0.3 mag. A list of newly identified metal-poor stars is presented. The M_V\ncalibration procedure developed here is reddening-independent and hence may\nserve as a powerful tool in studying galactic structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Jul 2013 07:10:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

To satisfy the specification, the program needs to act so that the\nspecification holds in every computation generated by its interaction with the\nenvironment. Often, the program cannot observe all attributes of its\nenvironment. In this case, we should transform a specification into a program\nwhose behavior depends only on the observable history of the computation. This\nis called synthesis with incomplete information. In such a setting, it is\ndesirable to have a knowledge-based specification, which can refer to the\nuncertainty the program has about the environment's behavior.

Signals detected at each element are sampled prior to digital\nbeamforming. The sampling rates required to perform high resolution digital\nbeamforming are significantly higher than the Nyquist rate of the signal and\nresult in considerable amount of data, that needs to be stored and processed. A\nrecently developed technique, compressed beamforming, based on the finite rate\nof innovation model, compressed sensing (CS) and Xampling ideas, allows to\nreduce the number of samples needed to reconstruct an image comprised of strong\nreflectors. A drawback of this method is its inability to treat speckle, which\nis of significant importance in medical imaging. Here we build on previous work\nand extend it to a general concept of beamforming in frequency. This allows to\nexploit the low bandwidth of the ultrasound signal and bypass the oversampling\ndictated by digital implementation of beamforming in time. Using beamforming in\nfrequency, the same image quality is obtained from far fewer samples. We next\npresent a CS-technique that allows for further rate reduction, using only a\nportion of the beamformed signal's bandwidth. We demonstrate our methods on in\nvivo cardiac data and show that reductions up to 1/28 over standard beamforming\nrates are possible. Finally, we present an implementation on an ultrasound\nmachine using sub-Nyquist sampling and processing. Our results prove that the\nconcept of sub-Nyquist processing is feasible for medical ultrasound, leading\nto the potential of considerable reduction in future ultrasound machines size,\npower consumption and cost.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Jul 2013 09:24:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-25"}

Among them, one of\nthe main trends is to incorporate the built-in sensors of smartphone and to\nexploit crowdsourcing potentials. However the noisy built-in sensors and\nmulti-tasking limitation of underline OS often hinder the effectiveness of\nthese schemes. In this work, we propose a passive crowdsourcing CSI-based\nindoor localization scheme, C2 IL. Our scheme C2 IL only requires the\nlocating-device (e.g., a phone) to have a 802.11n wireless connection, and it\ndoes not rely on inertial sensors only existing in some smartphones. C2 IL is\nbuilt upon our innovative method to accurately estimate the moving distance\npurely based on 802.11n Channel State Information (CSI). Our extensive\nevaluations show that the moving distance estimation error of our scheme is\nwithin 3% of the actual moving distance regardless of varying speeds and\nenvironment. Relying on the accurate moving distance estimation as constraints,\nwe are able to construct a more accurate mapping between RSS fingerprints and\nlocation. To address the challenges of collecting fingerprints, a\ncrowdsourcing- based scheme is designed to gradually establish the mapping and\npopulate the fingerprints. In C2 IL, we design a trajectory clustering-based\nlocalization algorithm to provide precise real-time indoor localization and\ntracking. We developed and deployed a practical working system of C2 IL in a\nlarge office environment. Extensive evaluation results indicate that our scheme\nC2 IL provides accurate localization with error 2m at 80% at very complex\nindoor environment with minimal overhead.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Jul 2013 09:33:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-25"}

We use full-orbit simulations of a 10 MeV proton beam in a\nturbulent magnetic field to study to what extent the spread across the mean\nfield can be described as diffusion early in a particle event. We compare the\nfull-orbit code results to solutions of a Fokker-Planck equation including\nspatial and pitch angle diffusion, and of one including also propagation of the\nparticles along random-walking magnetic field lines. We find that propagation\nof the particles along meandering field lines is the key process determining\ntheir cross-field spread at 1 AU at the beginning of the simulated event. The\nmean square displacement of the particles an hour after injection is an order\nof magnitude larger than that given by the diffusion model, indicating that\nmodels employing spatial cross-field diffusion cannot be used to describe early\nevolution of an SEP event. On the other hand, the diffusion of the particles\nfrom their initial field lines is negligible during the first 5 hours, which is\nconsistent with the observations of SEP intensity dropouts. We conclude that\nmodelling SEP events must take into account the particle propagation along\nmeandering field lines for the first 20 hours of the event.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Jul 2013 10:00:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-08"}

One aspect of this system's variability\nis the modulation of its emission with the timescale set by the ~26.4960-day\norbital period. Here we show that, during the time of our observations, the\ngamma-ray emission of LS I 61 303 also presents a sinusoidal variability\nconsistent with the previously-known superorbital period of 1667 days. This\nmodulation is more prominently seen at orbital phases around apastron, whereas\nit does not introduce a visible change close to periastron. It is also found in\nthe appearance and disappearance of variability at the orbital period in the\npower spectrum of the data. This behavior could be explained by a\nquasi-cyclical evolution of the equatorial outflow of the Be companion star,\nwhose features influence the conditions for generating gamma rays. These\nfindings open the possibility to use gamma-ray observations to study the\noutflows of massive stars in eccentric binary systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Jul 2013 11:15:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-22"}

In particular, we provide tight bounds between the violation of\na family of Bell inequalities among an arbitrary number of parties and the\nknowledge an external observer can gain about outcomes of any single\nmeasurement performed by the parties.

The spectral maximum of the\nphotoinduced anisotropy was observed at spectral energies equal to about 1.4 eV\n(energy gap equal to about 1.85 eV) corresponding to maximal density of the\nintrinsic defect levels.

To understand the origin of the observed photoinduced\nabsorption near the fundamental edge, the benchmark first-principles\ncalculations of the structural, electronic, optical and elastic properties of\nCu2CdGeS4 were performed in the general gradient approximation (GGA) and local\ndensity approximation (LDA) approaches.

Although a few numerical works are available in the\nliterature for specific domains in three dimensions such a general analytical\nprescription is presented for the first time. An appropriate transformation is\nused to get rid of the asymmetries in the domain boundary by mapping the\nboundary into an equivalent sphere with a deformed interior metric. The\ndeformed metric produces new source terms in the original homogeneous equation.\nA deformation parameter measuring the deviation of the boundary from a\nspherical one is introduced as a perturbative parameter. With the help of\nstandard Rayleigh-Schr{\\\"o}dinger perturbative technique the transformed\nequation is solved and the general solution is written down in a closed form at\neach order of perturbation. The solutions are boundary condition free and which\nmake them widely applicable for various situations. Once the boundary\nconditions are applied to these general solutions the eigenvalues and the\nwavefunctions are obtained order by order. The efficacy of the method has been\ntested by comparing the analytic values against the numerical ones for three\ndimensional enclosures of various shapes. The method seems to work quite well\nfor these shapes for both, Dirichlet as well as Neumann boundary conditions.\nThe usage of spherical harmonics to express the asymmetries in the boundary\nsurfaces helps us to consider a wide class of domains in three dimensions and\nalso their fast convergence guarantees the convergence of the perturbative\nseries for the energy. Direct applications of this method can be found in the\nfield of quantum dots, nuclear physics, acoustical and electromagnetic\ncavities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Jul 2013 13:37:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-21"}

In addition\nto taking considerable user time, this makes phylogenomic analyses difficult to\nreproduce, compare, and extend. In addition, methodological improvements made\nin the context of one study often cannot be easily applied and evaluated in the\ncontext of other studies. We present Agalma, an automated tool that conducts\nphylogenomic analyses.

However,\npion/muon and isotope decay-at-rest sources qualify. The ideal drivers for\ndecay-at-rest sources are cyclotron accelerators, which are compact and\nrelatively inexpensive. This paper describes a scheme to produce decay-at-rest\nsources driven by such cyclotrons, developed within the DAEdALUS program.\nExamples of the value of the high precision beams for pursuing Beyond Standard\nModel interactions are reviewed. New results on a combined DAEdALUS--Hyper-K\nsearch for CP-violation that achieve errors on the mixing matrix parameter of 4\ndegrees to 12 degrees are presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Jul 2013 15:49:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-25"}

In\nequilibrium at room temperature, the contour length distribution P(L) and\nend-to-end distance distribution P(R) are nearly Gaussian, the former gives an\nestimate of the stretch modulus {\\gamma}_1 of dsDNA in quantitative agreement\nwith the literature value.

When the dsDNA is compacted by positively charged dendrimer, the stretch\nmodulus stays invariant but the effective bending rigidity estimated from the\nend-to-end distance distribution decreases dramatically due to backbone charge\nneutralization of dsDNA by dendrimer. We support our observations with\nnumerical solutions of the worm-like-chain (WLC) model as well as using\nnon-equilibrium dsDNA stretching simulations.

Molonglo 843 MHz and ATCA data at 1.4\nand 2.4 GHz showed two shells. Recent high-resolution IR imaging revealed a\ncomplex dust structure and ongoing star formation. New high-bandwidth and\nhigh-resolution data of the RCW49 field were obtained to survey the radio\nemission at arcsec scale and investigate the small-scale features and nature of\nthe HII region.- Data were collected with the new 2-GHz bandwidth receivers and\nthe CABB correlator of the ATCA, at 5.5 and 9.0 GHz. In addition, archival\nobservations at 1.4 and 2.4 GHz have been re-reduced and re-analyzed, together\nwith optical, IR, X-ray, and gamma-ray observations.- The CABB data result in\nthe most detailed radio continuum images of RCW49 to date. The radio emission\nclosely mimics the near-IR emission observed by Spitzer, showing pillars and\nfilaments. The brightest continuum emission comes from the region known as the\nbridge. The overall flattish spectral index is consistent with a free-free\nemission mechanism. However, hints of nonthermal components are also present in\nthe bridge. A jet-like structure surrounded by a bubble feature whose nature is\nstill unclear has been discovered close to the Westerlund~2 core. Two apparent\nbow shocks and a number of discrete sources have been detected as well in the\nsurroundings of RCW49.

The detection of the RRL kinematically favors a RCW49\ndistance of 6--7 kpc. If the negative spectral indices measured at the bridge\nare caused by synchrotron emission, we propose a scenario where high-energy\nemission could be produced. Finally, the newly discovered jet-like structure\nappears to deserve a detailed study by itself.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Jul 2013 15:59:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 Aug 2013 18:54:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

Given limited data, predictability of such time series\nbecomes hard to infer. While efficient methods of Lyapunov exponent computation\nare devised, knowledge about the process driving the dynamics greatly\nfacilitates the complexity analysis. This paper shows that quarterly inventory\nchanges of wheat in the global market, during 1974-2012, follow a nonlinear\ndeterministic process. Lyapunov exponents of these fluctuations are computed\nusing sliding time windows each of length 131 quarters. Weakly chaotic behavior\nalternates with non-chaotic behavior over the entire period of analysis. More\nimportantly, in this paper, a cubic dependence of price changes on inventory\nchanges leads to establishment of deterministic Duffing-Oscillator-Model(DOM)\nas a suitable candidate for examining inventory fluctuations of wheat. DOM\nrepresents the interaction of commodity production cycle with an external\nintervention in the market. Parameters obtained for shifting time zones by\nfitting the Fourier estimated time signals to DOM are able to generate\nresponses that reproduce the true chaotic nature exhibited by the empirical\nsignal at that time. Endowing the parameters with suitable meanings, one may\ninfer that temporary changes in speculation reflect the pattern of inventory\nvolatility that drives the transitions between chaotic and non-chaotic\nbehavior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Jul 2013 15:57:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-08"}
