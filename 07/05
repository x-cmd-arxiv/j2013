For bright bursts, the inner disk is prone to radiation induced\nwarping which can tilt it into counter-rotation (i.e. retrograde).

The aim of our work is to use the bivariate GRFs to\ncapture both the dependence structure between humidity and temperature as well\nas their spatial dependencies. One important feature for the dataset is that\nthe humidity and temperature are not necessarily observed at the same\nlocations. Both univariate and bivariate spatial models are fitted and\ncompared. For modeling and inference the SPDE approach for univariate models\nand the systems of SPDEs approach for multivariate models have been used.\n  To evaluate the performance of the difference between the univariate and\nbivariate models, we compare predictive performance using some commonly used\nscoring rules: mean absolute error, mean-square error and continuous ranked\nprobability score.

The high dispersion suggests\nsources at cosmological distances, hence implying an extremely high radio\nluminosity, far larger than the power of single pulses from a pulsar. We\nsuggest that a fast radio burst represents the final signal of a supramassive\nrotating neutron star that collapses to a black hole due to magnetic braking.\nThe neutron star is initially above the critical mass for non-rotating models\nand is supported by rapid rotation. As magnetic braking constantly reduces the\nspin, the neutron star will suddenly collapse to a black hole several thousand\nto million years after its birth. We discuss several formation scenarios for\nsupramassive neutron stars and estimate the possible observational signatures\n{making use of the results of recent numerical general-relativistic\ncalculations. While the collapse will hide the stellar surface behind an event\nhorizon, the magnetic-field lines will snap violently. This can turn an almost\nordinary pulsar into a bright radio \"blitzar\": Accelerated electrons from the\ntravelling magnetic shock dissipate a significant fraction of the magnetosphere\nand produce a massive radio burst that is observable out to z>0.7.

There are several\nlinear time suffix array construction algorithms (SACAs) known in the\nliterature. However, one of the fastest algorithms in practice has a worst case\nrun time of $O(n^2)$. The problem of designing practically and theoretically\nefficient techniques remains open. In this paper we present an elegant\nalgorithm for suffix array construction which takes linear time with high\nprobability; the probability is on the space of all possible inputs. Our\nalgorithm is one of the simplest of the known SACAs and it opens up a new\ndimension of suffix array construction that has not been explored until now.\nOur algorithm is easily parallelizable.

Also for the second spin-1/2 we find finite cross\nsections in all directions in the ultra-relativistic limit, and conclude that\nits observability is not excluded neither by causality of propagation within an\nelectromagnetic environment, nor by unitarity of the Compton scattering\namplitudes in the ultraviolet. Finally, we notice that the method of the\ncombined Lorentz- and Poincar\\'e invariant projectors could be instrumental in\nopening a new avenue toward the consistent description of any spin by means of\nsecond order Lagrangians written in terms of sufficiently large reducible\nrepresentation spaces equipped with separate Lorentz-- and Dirac indices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Jul 2013 18:34:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-05"}

The additive transformation based TMCMC is\nsimilar in spirit to random walk Metropolis, except the fact that unlike the\nlatter, additive TMCMC uses a single draw from a onedimensional proposal\ndistribution to update the high-dimensional parameter. In this paper, we first\nprovide a brief tutorial on TMCMC, exploring its connections and contrasts with\nvarious available MCMC methods. Then we study the diffusion limits of additive\nTMCMC under various set-ups ranging from the product structure of the target\ndensity to the case where the target is absolutely continuous with respect to a\nGaussian measure; we also consider the additive TMCMC within Gibbs approach for\nall the above set-ups. These investigations lead to appropriate scaling of the\none-dimensional proposal density.

In the first part, we provide a general\nframework aimed to show how an efficient design of a sensor network requires a\njoint organization of in-network processing and communication. Then, we recall\nthe basic features of consensus algorithm, which is a basic tool to reach\nglobally optimal decisions through a distributed approach. The main part of the\npaper starts addressing the distributed estimation problem. We show first an\nentirely decentralized approach, where observations and estimations are\nperformed without the intervention of a fusion center. Then, we consider the\ncase where the estimation is performed at a fusion center, showing how to\nallocate quantization bits and transmit powers in the links between the nodes\nand the fusion center, in order to accommodate the requirement on the maximum\nestimation variance, under a constraint on the global transmit power. We extend\nthe approach to the detection problem. Also in this case, we consider the\ndistributed approach, where every node can achieve a globally optimal decision,\nand the case where the decision is taken at a central node. In the latter case,\nwe show how to allocate coding bits and transmit power in order to maximize the\ndetection probability, under constraints on the false alarm rate and the global\ntransmit power. Then, we generalize consensus algorithms illustrating a\ndistributed procedure that converges to the projection of the observation\nvector onto a signal subspace. We then address the issue of energy consumption\nin sensor networks, thus showing how to optimize the network topology in order\nto minimize the energy necessary to achieve a global consensus.

We present the results from the X-ray\nspectral analysis of 147 AGN selected by cross-correlating the highest spectral\nquality ultra-deep XMM-Newton and the Spitzer/IRAC catalogues in the CDF-S.\nConsequently it is biased towards sources with high S/N X-ray spectra.

We find 21/147 sources to be\nheavily absorbed but the uncertainties in their obscuring column densities do\nnot allow us to confirm their Compton-Thick nature without resorting to\nadditional criteria.

It is, however, necessary to test this\nprediction against other prominent line indices in optical wavelengths. We\nnewly identified roughly a thousand NaD excess objects (NEOs) based on the NaD\nline strength in the redshift range 0.00<z<0.08 from the SDSS DR7. The novelty\nof this work is that galaxies were carefully identified through direct visual\ninspection of SDSS images, and we systematically compared the properties of\nNEOs and those of a control sample of normal galaxies. Note that the majority\nof galaxies with high velocity dispersion (>250km/s) show NaD excess. Most\nlate-type NEOs have strong Hb line strengths and significant emission lines.\nThis implies that the presence of ISM and/or dust contributes to the increase\nin NaD line strengths observed for these galaxies. In contrast, the majority of\nearly-type NEOs are predominantly luminous and massive systems. However, we\nfind that models used to reproduce the NaI8190 line strengths that adopt a\nbottom-heavy IMF are not able to reproduce the observed NaD line strengths. By\ncomparing the observed NaD, Mgb and Fe5270 line strengths with those of the\nmodels, we identify a plausible range of parameters.

We extract the exact long-time asymptotics of the\norder parameter \\Delta(t) by exploiting the integrability of the classical\np-wave Hamiltonian, which we establish via a Lax construction. Three different\ntypes of behavior can occur depending upon the strength and direction of the\nquench. In phase I, the order parameter asymptotes to zero.

In this study,\nthus, we evaluate whether the modularity--robustness hypothesis is applicable\nto cancer using network analysis. We focus on 14 specific cancer types whose\nmolecular signaling networks are available in databases, and show that modular\norganization of cancer signaling networks is associated with the patient\nsurvival rate.

NCMA is the first realized multiple\naccess scheme that establishes the usefulness of PNC in a non-relay setting.\nNCMA allows multiple nodes to transmit simultaneously to the access point (AP)\nto boost throughput. In the non-relay setting, when two nodes A and B transmit\nto the AP simultaneously, the AP aims to obtain both packet A and packet B\nrather than their network-coded packet. An interesting question is whether\nnetwork coding, specifically PNC which extracts packet (A XOR B), can still be\nuseful in such a setting. We provide an affirmative answer to this question\nwith a novel two-layer decoding approach amenable to real-time implementation.\nOur USRP prototype indicates that NCMA can boost throughput by 100% in the\nmedium-high SNR regime (>=10dB).

In this Lecture Note we show that phase\nseparation in these materials generally belongs to what we call \"viscoelastic\nphase separation\", where the morphology is determined by the mechanical balance\nof not only the thermodynamic force (interface tension) but also the\nviscoelastic force. The origin of the viscoelastic force is dynamic asymmetry\nbetween the components of a mixture, which can be caused by either a size\ndisparity or a difference in the glass transition temperature between the\ncomponents. We stress that such dynamic asymmetry generally exists in soft\nmatter. The key is that dynamical asymmetry leads to a non-trivial coupling\nbetween the concentration, velocity, and stress fields. Viscoelastic phase\nseparation can be explained by viscoelastic relaxation in pattern evolution and\nthe resulting switching of the relevant order parameter, which are induced by\nthe competition between the deformation rate of phase separation and the\nslowest mechanical relaxation rate of a system. We also discuss an intimate\nlink of viscoelastic phase separation, where deformation fields are\nspontaneously generated by phase separation itself, to mechanical instability\n(or fracture) of glassy material, which is induced by externally imposed strain\nfields. We propose that all these phenomena can be understood as\nmechanically-driven inhomogeneization in a unified manner.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Jul 2013 04:11:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-08"}

We show that the fraction of time a k^{th} tier BS can be kept ON,\ntermed availability \\rho_k, is a fundamental metric of interest.

Under degeneracy of the electron gas (high concentration, low\ntemperature), a dip at the center of the polarization profile appears with a\npolarization maximum at a distance of about $2 \\; \\mu m$ from the center. This\ncounterintuitive result reveals that photoelectron diffusion depends on spin,\nas a direct consequence of the Pauli principle. This causes a concentration\ndependence of the spin stiffness while the spin dependence of the mobility is\nfound to be weak in doped material. The various effects which can modify spin\ntransport in a degenerate electron gas under local laser excitation are\nconsidered. A comparison of the data with a numerical solution of the coupled\ndiffusion equations reveals that ambipolar coupling with holes increases the\nsteady-state photo-electron density at the excitation spot and therefore the\namplitude of the degeneracy-induced polarization dip. Thermoelectric currrents\nare predicted to depend on spin under degeneracy (spin Soret currents), but\nthese currents are negligible except at very high excitation power where they\nplay a relatively small role.

This can be prevented by\nintroducing Marine Protected Areas (MPA's), regions in the ocean or along\ncoastlines where fishing is controlled. MPA's can also lead to larger fish\ndensities outside the protected area through spill-over, which in turn may\nincrease the fishing yield. A natural question in this context, is where\nexactly to establish an MPA, in order to maximize these benefits. This problem\nis addressed along a one-dimensional stretch of coast-line, by first proposing\na model for the fish dynamics. Fish are assumed to move diffusively, and are\nsubject to recruitment, natural death and harvesting through fishing. The\nproblem is then cast as an optimal control problem for the steady state\nequation corresponding to the PDE which models the fish dynamics. The\nfunctional being maximized is a weighted sum of the average fish density and\nthe average fishing yield. It is shown that optimal controls exist, and that\nthe form of an optimal control -and hence the location of the MPA- is\ndetermined by two key model parameters, namely the size of the coast, and the\nweight of the average fish density appearing in the functional. If these\nparameters are large enough -and precisely how large, can be calculated\nexactly- the results indicate when and where an MPA should be established. The\nresults indicate that an MPA always takes the form of a Marine Reserve, where\nfishing is prohibited. The main mathematical tool used to prove the results is\nPontryagin's maximum principle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Jul 2013 10:59:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-08"}

The X-ray emission extends over a ~30-kpc diameter\nregion and although it is less extended than the GHz-radio lobes, it is roughly\naligned with them. We suggest that the X-ray emission arises from Inverse\nCompton (IC) scattering of photons by relativistic electrons around the radio\ngalaxy. At z=4.11 this is the highest redshift detection of IC emission around\na radio galaxy. We investigate the hypothesis that in this compact source, the\nCosmic Microwave Background (CMB), which is ~700x more intense than at z~0 is\nnonetheless not the relevant seed photon field for the bulk of the IC emission.\nInstead, we find a tentative correlation between the IC emission and\nfar-infrared luminosities of compact, far-infrared luminous high-redshift radio\ngalaxies (those with lobe lengths of <100kpc). Based on these results we\nsuggest that in the earliest phases of the evolution of radio-loud AGN at very\nhigh redshift, the far-infrared photons from the co-eval dusty starbursts\noccuring within these systems may make a significant contribution to their IC\nX-ray emission and so contribute to the feedback in these massive high-redshift\ngalaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Jul 2013 12:29:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

We apply the numerical renormalization-group method to the case of a\nsub-Ohmic bosonic bath exponent and a constant conduction-electron density of\nstates. Starting in the Kondo phase at zero transverse-field, there is a smooth\ncrossover with increasing transverse field from a fully screened to a fully\npolarized impurity spin. By contrast, if the system starts in its localized\nphase, then increasing the transverse field causes a continuous,\nKondo-destruction transition into the partially polarized Kondo phase. The\ncritical exponents at this quantum phase transition exhibit hyperscaling and\ntake essentially the same values as those of the BFKM in zero transverse field.\nThe many-body spectrum at criticality varies continuously with the bare\ntransverse field, indicating a line of critical points.
