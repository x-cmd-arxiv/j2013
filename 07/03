In a\n$(1+1)$-dimensional space-time the defects are classically degenerate in mass\nkinks, but in $(3+1)$ dimensions the kinks become BPS domain walls, all of them\nsharing the same surface tension at the classical level. The heat kernel/zeta\nfunction regularization method will be used to control the divergences induced\nby the quantum kink and domain wall fluctuations. A generalization of the\nGilkey-DeWitt-Avramidi heat kernel expansion will be developed in order to\naccommodate the infrared divergences due to zero modes in the spectra of the\nsecond-order kink and domain wall fluctuation operators, which are respectively\n$N\\times N$ matrix ordinary or partial differential operators. Use of these\ntools in the spectral zeta function associated with the Hessian operators paves\nthe way to obtain general formulas for the one-loop kink mass and domain wall\ntension shifts in any $(1+1)$- or $(3+1)$-dimensional $N$-component scalar\nfield theory model. Application of these formulae to the BPS kinks or domain\nwalls of the $N=2$ model mentioned above reveals the breaking of the classical\nmass or surface tension degeneracy at the quantum level. Because the main\nparameter distinguishing each member in the BPS kink or domain wall moduli\nspace is essentially the distance between the centers of two basic kinks or\nwalls, the breaking of the degeneracy amounts to the surge in quantum-induced\nforces between the two constituent topological defects. The differences in\nsurface tension induced by one-loop fluctuations of BPS walls give rise mainly\nto attractive forces between the constituent walls except if the two basic\nwalls are very far apart. Repulsive forces between two close walls only arise\nif the coupling is approaches the critical value from below.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Jul 2013 16:06:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Nov 2013 15:01:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 17 Jan 2014 12:12:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-29"}

These densities are global characteristics of the union set\nwhich can be estimated from observations. In contrast local characteristics\nlike the mean Minkowski tensor of a single random particle cannot be observed\ndirectly, since the particles overlap.

These images clearly show that the main, dusty nebula is a shell of\nradius 0.5 pc and width 0.35 pc extending outside the H-alpha nebula. They also\nreveal a second, bigger and fainter dust nebula, observed for the first time.\nBoth nebulae lie in an empty cavity, likely the remnant of the O-star wind\nbubble formed when the star was on the main sequence. The kinematic ages of the\nnebulae are about 20000 and 80000 years and each nebula contains about 0.05\nMsun of dust. Modeling of the inner nebula indicates a Fe-rich dust. The\nfar-infrared spectrum of the main nebula revealed forbidden emission lines\ncoming from ionized and neutral gas. Our study shows that the main nebula\nconsists of a shell of ionized gas surrounded by a thin photodissociation\nregion illuminated by an \"average\" early-B star. The derived abundance ratios\nN/O=1.0+/-0.4 and C/O=0.4+/-0.2 indicate a mild N/O enrichment. We estimate\nthat the inner shell contains 1.7+/-0.6 Msun of gas. Assuming a similar\ndust-to-gas ratio for the outer nebula, the total mass ejected by WRAY 15-751\namounts to 4+/-2 Msun. The measured abundances, masses and kinematic ages of\nthe nebulae were used to constrain the evolution of the star and the epoch at\nwhich the nebulae were ejected. Our results point to an ejection of the nebulae\nduring the RSG evolutionary phase of an ~ 40 Msun star. The presence of\nmultiple shells around the star suggests that the mass-loss was not a\ncontinuous ejection but rather a series of episodes of extreme mass-loss. Our\nmeasurements are compatible with the recent evolutionary tracks computed for an\n40 Msun star with little rotation. They support the O-BSG-RSG-YSG-LBV filiation\nand the idea that high-luminosity and low-luminosity LBVs follow different\nevolutionary paths.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Jul 2013 16:51:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-09"}

DR-DL is susceptible\nto numerical inaccuracy owing to interpolation and regridding errors in a\ndiscretized q-space. In this paper, we propose a novel CR-DL approach, called\nDictionary Learning - Spherical Polar Fourier Imaging (DL-SPFI) for effective\ncompressed-sensing reconstruction of the q-space diffusion-weighted signal and\nthe EAP. In DL-SPFI, an dictionary that sparsifies the signal is learned from\nthe space of continuous Gaussian diffusion signals. The learned dictionary is\nthen adaptively applied to different voxels using a weighted LASSO framework\nfor robust signal reconstruction. The adaptive dictionary is proved to be\noptimal. Compared with the start-of-the-art CR-DL and DR-DL methods proposed by\nMerlet et al. and Bilgic et al., espectively, our work offers the following\nadvantages. First, the learned dictionary is proved to be optimal for Gaussian\ndiffusion signals. Second, to our knowledge, this is the first work to learn a\nvoxel-adaptive dictionary. The importance of the adaptive dictionary in EAP\nreconstruction will be demonstrated theoretically and empirically. Third,\noptimization in DL-SPFI is only performed in a small subspace resided by the\nSPF coefficients, as opposed to the q-space approach utilized by Merlet et al.\nThe experiment results demonstrate the advantages of DL-SPFI over the original\nSPF basis and Bilgic et al.'s method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Jul 2013 17:47:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-04"}

It is\nhence customary to assume the existence of an underlying dark matter component\nwith density fluctuations, $\\Delta(M)$, having amplitudes much larger than what\nCMB observations imply for the baryons. This is in fact one of the recurrent\narguments used in support of the dark matter hypothesis. In this letter we\nprove that the same extended theory of gravity which has been recently shown to\naccurately reproduce gravitational lensing observations, in absence of any dark\nmatter, and which in the low velocity regime converges to a MONDian force law,\nimplies a sufficiently amplified self-gravity to allow purely baryonic\nfluctuations with amplitudes in accordance with CMB constraints to naturally\ngrow into the $z=0$ astrophysical structures detected. The linear structure\nformation scenario which emerges closely resembles the standard concordance\ncosmology one, as abundantly calibrated over the last decade to match multiple\nobservational constraints at various redshifts. However, in contrast with what\noccurs in the concordance cosmology, this follows not from a critical\ndependence on initial conditions and the fine tuning of model parameters, but\nfrom the rapid convergence of highly arbitrary initial conditions onto a well\ndefined $\\Delta(M,z)$ attractor solution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Jul 2013 17:51:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-03"}

Our\nexperimental study shows that the streaming client's rate selection trajectory,\ni.e., the set of selected segments of varied bit rates which constitute a\ncomplete video, is not repetitive across separate downloads. Also, the\ninvolvement of caching could lead to frequent alternation between cache and\nserver when serving back client's requests for video segments. These\nobservations warrant cautions for rate adaption algorithm design and trigger\nour analysis to characterize the performance of in-network caching for HTTP\nstreaming. Our analytic results show: (i) a significant degradation of cache\nhit rate for adaptive streaming, with a typical file popularity distribution in\nnowadays internet; (ii) as a result of the (usually) higher throughput at the\nclient-cache connection compared to client-server one, cache-server\noscillations due to misjudgments of the rate adaptation algorithm occur.\nFinally, we introduce DASH-INC, a framework for improved video streaming in\ncaching networks including transcoding and multiple throughput estimation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Jul 2013 18:56:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 Jul 2013 16:27:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-04"}

Follow-up observations of the 66 candidates with projected\nseparation < 500 AU show that all of them are background objects. To establish\nstatistical constraints on the underlying giant planet population based on our\nimaging data, we have developed a new Bayesian formalism that incorporates (1)\nnon-detections, (2) single-epoch candidates, (3) astrometric and (4)\nphotometric information, and (5) the possibility of multiple planets per star\nto constrain the planet population. Our formalism allows us to include in our\nanalysis the previously known Beta Pictoris and the HR 8799 planets. Our\nresults show at 95% confidence that <13% of debris disk stars have a >5MJup\nplanet beyond 80 AU, and <21% of debris disk stars have a >3MJup planet outside\nof 40 AU, based on hot-start evolutionary models. We model the population of\ndirectly-imaged planets as d^2N/dMda ~ m^alpha a^beta, where m is planet mass\nand a is orbital semi-major axis (with a maximum value of amax). We find that\nbeta < -0.8 and/or alpha > 1.7. Likewise, we find that beta < -0.8 and/or amax\n< 200 AU. If we ignore the Beta Pic and HR 8799 planets (should they belong to\na rare and distinct group), we find that < 20% of debris disk stars have a >\n3MJup planet beyond 10 AU, and beta < -0.8 and/or alpha < -1.5. Our Bayesian\nconstraints are not strong enough to reveal any dependence of the planet\nfrequency on stellar host mass. Studies of transition disks have suggested that\nabout 20% of stars are undergoing planet formation; our non-detections at large\nseparations show that planets with orbital separation > 40 AU and planet masses\n> 3 MJup do not carve the central holes in these disks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Jul 2013 20:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

In cluster cores, early type galaxies dominate, whereas\nstar-forming galaxies are more and more common in the outskirts. At higher\nredshifts and in somewhat less dense environments (e.g. galaxy groups), the\nsituation is less clear. One open issue is that of whether and how the star\nformation rate (SFR) of galaxies in groups depends on the distance from the\ncentre of mass. To shed light on this topic, we have built a sample of X-ray\nselected galaxy groups at 0<z<1.6 in various blank fields (ECDFS, COSMOS,\nGOODS). We use a sample of spectroscopically confirmed group members with\nstellar mass M >10^10.3 M_sun in order to have a high spectroscopic\ncompleteness. As we use only spectroscopic redshifts, our results are not\naffected by uncertainties due to projection effects. We use several SFR\nindicators to link the star formation (SF) activity to the galaxy environment.\nTaking advantage of the extremely deep mid-infrared Spitzer MIPS and\nfar-infrared Herschel PACS observations, we have an accurate, broad-band\nmeasure of the SFR for the bulk of the star-forming galaxies. We use\nmulti-wavelength SED fitting techniques to estimate the stellar masses of all\nobjects and the SFR of the MIPS and PACS undetected galaxies. We analyse the\ndependence of the SF activity, stellar mass and specific SFR on the\ngroup-centric distance, up to z~1.6, for the first time. We do not find any\ncorrelation between the mean SFR and group-centric distance at any redshift. We\ndo not observe any strong mass segregation either, in agreement with\npredictions from simulations. Our results suggest that either groups have a\nmuch smaller spread in accretion times with respect to the clusters and that\nthe relaxation time is longer than the group crossing time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Jul 2013 20:15:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Jul 2013 22:52:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

As such, they should follow the star formation rate (SFR) of\ngalaxies. We can use them to probe for star-forming galaxies (SFGs) in the\ndistant universe following this assumption. The relation between the rate of\nLGRBs in a given galaxy and its SFR (that we call the LGRB \"bias\") may be\ncomplex, as we have indications that the LGRB hosts are not perfect analogues\nto the general population of SFGs. In this work, we try to quantify the\ndependence of the LGRB bias on physical parameters of their host galaxy such as\nthe SFR or the stellar mass. We propose an empirical method based on the\ncomparison of stellar mass functions (and SFR distributions) of LGRB hosts and\nof SFGs in order to find how the bias depends on the stellar mass or the SFR.\nBy applying this method to a sample of LGRB hosts at redshifts lower than 1.1,\nwhere the properties of SFGs are well established, and where the properties of\nLGRB host galaxies can be deduced from observations (for stellar masses larger\nthan 10**9.25 Msun and SFR larger than 1.8 Msun / yr), we find that the LGRB\nbias depends on both the stellar mass and SFR. We find that the bias decreases\nwith the SFR, i.e. we see no preference for highly SFGs, once taken into\naccount the larger number of massive stars in galaxies with larger SFR. We do\nnot find any trend with the specific star formation rate (SSFR) but the\ndynamical range in SSFR in our study is narrow. Although through an indirect\nmethod, we relate these trends to a possible decrease of the LGRBs rate / SFR\nratio with the metallicity. The method we propose suggests trends that may be\nuseful to constrain models of LGRB progenitors, showing a clear decrease of the\nLGRB bias with the metallicity. This is promising for the future as the number\nof LGRB hosts studied will increase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Jul 2013 09:41:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

Once a privacy model has been selected, the goal is to enforce it\nwhile preserving as much data utility as possible. The main objective of this\nthesis is to improve the data utility in k-anonymous and differentially private\ndata releases. k-Anonymity has several drawbacks. On the disclosure limitation\nside, there is a lack of protection against attribute disclosure and against\ninformed intruders. On the data utility side, dealing with a large number of\nquasi-identifier attributes is problematic. We propose a relaxation of\nk-anonymity that deals with these issues.\n  Differential privacy limits disclosure risk through noise addition. The\nLaplace distribution is commonly used for the random noise. We show that the\nLaplace distribution is not optimal: the same disclosure limitation guarantee\ncan be attained by adding less noise. Optimal univariate and multivariate\nnoises are characterized and constructed.\n  Common mechanisms to attain differential privacy do not take into account the\nusers prior knowledge; they implicitly assume zero initial knowledge about the\nquery response. We propose a mechanism that focuses on limiting the knowledge\ngain over the prior knowledge.\n  Microaggregation-based k-anonymity and differential privacy can be combined\nto produce microdata releases with the strong privacy guarantees of\ndifferential privacy and improved data accuracy.\n  The last contribution delves into the relation between t-closeness and\ndifferential privacy. We see that for a specific distance and under some\nreasonable assumptions on the intruders knowledge, t-closeness leads to\ndifferential privacy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Jul 2013 10:55:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-04"}

The moving cluster effect can be expressed as\nthe scalar product of the lensing deflection angle with the tangential velocity\nof the mass components, and it is maximal for clusters colliding in the plane\nof the sky with velocities boosted by their mutual gravity. The bullet cluster\nis likely to be the best candidate for the first measurement of this effect due\nto the large collision velocity and because the lensing deflection and the\ncluster fields can be calculated in advance. We derive the deflection field\nusing multiply-lensed background galaxies detected with the Hubble Space\nTelescope. The velocity field is modeled using self-consistent\nN-body/hydrodynamical simulations constrained by the observed X-ray and\ngravitational lensing features of this system. We predict that the\ntriply-lensed images of systems \"G\" and \"H\" straddling the critical curve of\nthe bullet component will show the largest frequency shifts up to ~0.5 km/sec.\nThis is within the range of the Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array\n(ALMA) for molecular emission, and is near the resolution limit of the new\ngeneration high-throughput optical-IR spectrographs. A detection of this effect\nmeasures the tangential motion of the subclusters directly, thereby clarifying\nthe tension with LCDM, which is inferred from gas motion less directly. This\nmethod may be extended to smaller redshift differences using the Ly-alpha\nforest towards QSOs lensed by more typical clusters of galaxies. More\ngenerally, the tangential component of the peculiar velocities of clusters\nderived by our method complements the radial component determined by the\nkinematic SZ effect, providing a full 3-dimensional description of velocities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Jul 2013 12:11:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

First, we introduce \"Mixed Noisy Network Coding\" (MNNC) scheme\nwhich generalizes \"Noisy Network Coding\" (NNC) where relays are allowed to\ndecode-and-forward (DF) messages while all of them (without exception) transmit\nnoisy descriptions of their observations. These descriptions are exploited at\nthe destination and the DF relays aim to decode the transmitted messages while\ncreating full cooperation among the nodes. Moreover, the destination and the DF\nrelays can independently select the set of descriptions to be decoded or\ntreated as interference. This concept is further extended to multi-hopping\nscenarios, referred to as \"Layered MNNC\" (LMNNC), where DF relays are organized\ninto disjoint groups representing one hop in the network. For cooperative\nunicast additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) networks we show that -provided DF\nrelays are properly chosen- MNNC improves over all previously established\nconstant gaps to the cut-set bound. Secondly, we consider the composite\ncooperative unicast network where the channel parameters are randomly drawn\nbefore communication starts and remain fixed during the transmission. Each draw\nis assumed to be unknown at the source and fully known at the destination but\nonly partly known at the relays. We introduce through MNNC scheme the concept\nof \"Selective Coding Strategy\" (SCS) that enables relays to decide dynamically\nwhether, in addition to communicate noisy descriptions, is possible to decode\nand forward messages.

As the collapse progresses, the centre of the core begins to\nheat up as it becomes optically thick. The temperature and density in the\ncentre eventually reach high enough values where fusion reactions can ignite;\nthe protostar is born. This sequence of events entail many physical processes,\nof which radiative transfer is of paramount importance. Many simulations of\nprotostellar collapse make use of a grey treatment of radiative transfer\ncoupled to the hydrodynamics. However, interstellar gas and dust opacities\npresent large variations as a function of frequency. In this paper, we\nfollow-up on a previous paper on the collapse and formation of Larson's first\ncore using multigroup radiation hydrodynamics (Paper I) by extending the\ncalculations to the second phase of the collapse and the formation of Larson's\nsecond core. We have made the use of a non-ideal gas equation of state as well\nas an extensive set of spectral opacities in a spherically symmetric fully\nimplicit Godunov code to model all the phases of the collapse of a 0.1, 1 and\n10 solar mass cloud cores. We find that, for a same central density, there are\nonly small differences between the grey and multigroup simulations. The first\ncore accretion shock remains supercritical while the shock at the second core\nborder is found to be strongly subcritical with all the accreted energy being\ntransfered to the core. The size of the first core was found to vary somewhat\nin the different simulations (more unstable clouds form smaller first cores)\nwhile the size, mass and temperature of the second cores are independent of\ninitial cloud mass, size and temperature. Our simulations support the idea of a\nstandard (universal) initial second core size of 0.003 AU and mass 0.0014 solar\nmasses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Jul 2013 13:37:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

We solve this\nproblem here with a dynamic feedback technique that locks the quantum dot\nemission frequency to a reference. The incoherent scattering (resonance\nfluorescence) represents the single photon output whereas the coherent\nscattering (Rayleigh scattering) is used for the feedback control. The\nfluctuations in emission frequency are reduced to 20 MHz, just ~ 5% of the\nquantum dot optical linewidth, even over several hours. By eliminating the\n1/f-like noise, the relative fluctuations in resonance fluorescence intensity\nare reduced to ~ 10E-5 at low frequency. Under these conditions, the\nantibunching dip in the resonance fluorescence is described extremely well by\nthe two-level atom result. The technique represents a way of removing charge\nnoise from a quantum device.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Jul 2013 14:03:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-28"}

In the CSL model each particle interacts with a\nnoise field that induces the collapse of its wave function. As a consequence of\nthis interaction, when the particle is electrically charged, it radiates. As\ndiscussed in [1], the formula for the emission rate, to first perturbative\norder, contains two terms: One is proportional to the Fourier component of the\nnoise field at the same frequency as that of the emitted photon and one is\nproportional to the zero Fourier component of the noise field.

Logical formulas are then denoted by behaviours. Finally\nproofs are interpreted as designs satisfying particular properties. In that\nway, designs are more general than proofs and we may notice in particular that\nthey are not typed objects. Incarnation is introduced by Girard in Ludics as a\ncharacterization of \"useful\" designs in a behaviour. The incarnation of a\ndesign is defined as its subdesign that is the smallest one in the behaviour\nordered by inclusion. It is useful in particular because being \"incarnated\" is\none of the conditions for a design to denote a proof of a formula. The\ncomputation of incarnation is important also as it gives a minimal denotation\nfor a formula, and more generally for a behaviour. We give here a constructive\nway to capture the incarnation of the behaviour of a set of designs, without\ncomputing the behaviour itself.

In all cases the\nphotoionization models predict very strong emission from high ionization lines\nthat will not be emitted by the Crab's filaments, alleviating problems with\ndetecting these lines in the presence of light scattered from brighter parts of\nthe Crab.

The real pole is the frequency\nof a perfect (infinite Q) guided mode, which becomes lossy as the frequency\ngains an imaginary part. This work extends results of Shipman and Venakides to\nevanescent source fields and two-dimensional parallel wavevector and\ndemonstrates by example how the latter allows one to control independently the\nwidth and central frequency of a resonance by varying the angle of incidence of\nthe source field. The analysis relies on two nondegeneracy conditions of the\ncomplex dispersion relation for slab modes (relating poles of the scattering\nmatrix to wavevector), which were assumed in previous works and are proved in\nthis work for layered media. One of them asserts that the dispersion relation\nnear the wavevector and frequency of a perfect guided mode is the zero set of a\nsimple eigenvalue, and the other relates the frequency derivative of the\neigenvalue to the total energy of the mode, thereby implying that this\nderivative is nonzero.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Jul 2013 17:32:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

When the input vectors are binary vectors, these gates correspond to\nBoolean functions and can be analyzed via their polynomial representations. In\npractical applications, it is desirable to find a polynomial representation\nwith the smallest number of terms possible, in order to use the least possible\nnumber of input lines to the unit under consideration. For this purpose,\ninstead of an exact polynomial representation, usually the sign representation\nof a Boolean function is considered. The non-uniqueness of the sign\nrepresentation allows the possibility for using a smaller number of monomials\nby solving a minimization problem. This minimization problem is combinatorial\nin nature, and so far the best known deterministic algorithm claims the use of\nat most $0.75\\times 2^n$ of the $2^n$ total possible monomials. In this paper,\nthe basic methods of representing a Boolean function by polynomials are\nexamined, and an alternative approach to this problem is proposed. It is shown\nthat it is possible to use at most $0.5\\times 2^n = 2^{n-1}$ monomials based on\nthe $\\{0, 1\\}$ binary inputs by introducing extra variables, and at the same\ntime keeping the degree upper bound at $n$. An algorithm for further reduction\nof the number of terms that used in a polynomial representation is provided.\nExamples show that in certain applications, the improvement achieved by the\nproposed method over the existing methods is significant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Jul 2013 19:05:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-05"}

Our main\nobjective is to compute sufficiently and accurately the position and the period\nof the periodic orbits. For the derivation of the above quantities (position\nand period) we deploy in each resonance case semi-numerical methods. The\ncomparison of our semi-numerical results with those obtained by the numerical\nintegration of the equations of motion indicates that, in every case the\nrelative error is always less than 1% and therefore, the agreement is more than\nsufficient. Thus, we claim that semi-numerical methods are very effective tools\nfor computing periodic orbits. We also study in detail, the case when the\nenergy of the orbits is larger than the escape energy. In this case, the\nperiodic orbits in almost all resonance families become unstable and eventually\nescape from the system.

The magnetic interaction\nterm derived by Darwin is the same as the, so called, Breit term in\nrelativistic quantum mechanics. While this term always is a small perturbation\nin few body systems it can be shown to be potentially dominating in systems of\nlarge numbers of electrons. It is therefore a natural candidate in the\nexplanation of emergent phenomena---phenomena that only occur in sufficiently\nlarge systems. The dimensionless parameter that indicates the importance of the\nmagnetic energy is the number of electrons times the classical electron radius\ndivided by the size of the system. The number of electrons involved are only\nthe electrons at the Fermi surface; electrons with lower energy cannot\ncontribute to current density and thus not to the magnetic field.\n  The conventional understanding of superconductivity has always been\nproblematic and no really reductionistic derivation exists. The idea that the\ninductive inertia, due to magnetism, is important in the explanation of\nsuperconductivity was first advanced by Frenkel and later brought up by Welker\nbefore it was prematurely discarded. So were theories involving Wigner\ncrystallization. We speculate that the answer requires the combination of a\nWigner lattice and the Darwin interaction. We point out that the Darwin\ninteraction can be shown to have the right order of magnitude to explain the\nenergy scales involved in normal superconductors. The London magnetic moment of\nrotating superconductors and the Meissner effect and their connection are\ndiscussed next. The London moment is shown to indicate that the number of\nelectrons involved in the superconducting condensate is such that the Darwin\ninteraction cannot be neglected.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Jul 2013 13:41:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-06"}
