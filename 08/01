Typically,\nresearchers set up experiments where control samples are compared to a\ntreatment condition, and using the t-test they identify differentially\nexpressed genes upon which further analysis and ultimately biological discovery\nfrom such experiments is based. Here we describe an alternative geometrical\napproach to identify differentially expressed genes. We show that this\nalternative method, called the Characteristic Direction, is capable of\nidentifying more relevant genes. We evaluate our approach in three case\nstudies. In the first two, we match transcription factor targets determined by\nChIP-seq profiling with differentially expressed genes after the same\ntranscription factor knockdown or over-expression in mammalian cells. In the\nthird case study, we evaluate the quality of enriched terms when comparing\nnormal epithelial cells with cancer stem cells. In conclusion, we demonstrate\nthat the Characteristic Direction approach is much better in calling the\nsignificantly differentially expressed genes and should replace the widely\ncurrently in used t-test method for this purpose.

We carry out\nstatistical equilibrium calculations using CO-H2 collision rates to solve for\nthe H2 density in the observed sources without including effects of radiative\ntrapping. We have assumed kinetic temperatures of 50 K and 100 K, finding this\nchoice to make relatively little difference to the lowest transition.

First, we optimize the gate\nfidelity ($f$) for fixed $g$ as a function of the other control parameters;\nthis yields an $f^\\text{opt}(g)$ that is universal for different types of\ngates. Next, we identify physical constraints on the control parameters; this\nyields an upper bound $f^\\text{max}$ that is specific to the qubit-gate\ncombination. We show that similar gate fidelities ($ \\sim 99.5$%) should be\nattainable for ST qubits in isotopically purified Si, and for hybrid qubits in\nnatural Si. Considerably lower fidelities are obtained for GaAs devices, due to\nthe fluctuating magnetic fields $\\Delta B$ produced by nuclear spins.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Jul 2013 17:53:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 6 Dec 2013 20:00:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-09"}

Determining the nature of their progenitors is a crucial step\ntowards understanding the properties of SNe. Until recently, no progenitor has\nbeen directly detected for SN of type Ibc, which are believed to come from\nmassive stars that lose their hydrogen envelope through stellar winds and from\nbinary systems where the companion has stripped the H envelope from the\nprimary. Here we analyze recently reported observations of iPTF13bvn, which\ncould possibly be the first detection of a SN Ib progenitor based on\npre-explosion images. Very interestingly, the recently published Geneva models\nof single stars can reproduce the observed photometry of the progenitor\ncandidate and its mass-loss rate, confirming a recently proposed scenario. We\nfind that a single WR star with initial mass in the range 31-35 Msun fits the\nobserved photometry of the progenitor of iPTF13bvn. The progenitor likely has a\nluminosity of log (L/Lsun)~5.55, surface temperature ~45000 K, and mass of\n~10.9 Msun at the time of explosion. Our non-rotating 32 Msun model\noverestimates the derived radius of the progenitor, although this could likely\nbe reconciled with a fine-tuned model of a more massive (between 40 and 50\nMsun), hotter, and luminous progenitor. Our models indicate a very uncertain\nejecta mass of ~8 Msun, which is higher than the average of the SN Ib ejecta\nmass that is derived from the lightcurve (2-4 Msun). This possibly high ejecta\nmass could produce detectable effects in the iPTF13bvn lightcurve and spectrum.\nIf the candidate is indeed confirmed to be the progenitor, our results suggest\nthat stars with relatively high initial masses (>30 Msun) can produce visible\nSN explosions at their deaths and do not collapse directly to a black hole.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Jul 2013 19:25:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Oct 2013 07:24:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-11"}

In such cases, we show that the two limb\ndarkening coefficients are constrained by three physical boundary conditions,\ndescribing a triangular region in the two-dimensional parameter space.

This conjecture is motivated by the holographic model of QCD\nwhere confinement -deconfinement phase transition indeed happens precisely at\ntemperature T=T_c where $\\theta$ dependence of the vacuum energy experiences a\nsudden change in behaviour: from N^2\\cos(\\theta/N) at T<T_c to\n\\cos\\theta\\exp(-N) at T>T_c. This conjecture is also supported by recent\nlattice studies. We employ this conjecture to study a possible phase transition\nas a function of \\kappa\\equiv N_f/N from confinement to conformal phase in the\nVeneziano limit N_f\\sim N when number of flavours and colours are large, but\nthe ratio \\kappa is finite. Technically, we consider an operator which gets its\nexpectation value solely from nonperturbative instaton effects. When \\kappa\nexceeds some critical value \\kappa> \\kappa_c the integral over instanton size\nis dominated by small-size instatons, making the instanton computations\nreliable with expected \\exp(-N) behaviour. However, when \\kappa<\\kappa_c, the\nintegral over instaton size is dominated by large-size instantons, and the\ninstanton expansion breaks down. This regime with \\kappa<\\kappa_c corresponds\nto the confinement phase.

Recent advances in understanding of the\ncontinuous formation of globular clusters over cosmic time and the concurrent\nevolution of the galaxy stellar distribution allow us to construct a simple\nmodel that matches the observed spatial and mass distributions of clusters in\nthe Galaxy and the giant elliptical galaxy M87. In order to compare with\nobservations, we model the effects of dynamical friction and dynamical\nevolution, including stellar mass loss, tidal stripping of stars, and tidal\ndisruption of clusters by the growing galactic nucleus. We find that\ninspiraling globular clusters form a dense central structure, with mass and\nradius comparable to the typical values in observed nuclear star clusters\n(NSCs) in late-type and low-mass early-type galaxies. The density contrast\nassociated with the NSC is less pronounced in giant elliptical galaxies. Our\nresults indicate that the NSC mass as a fraction of mass of the galaxy stellar\nspheroid scales as M_NSC/M_* = 0.0025 M_{*,11}^{-0.5}. Thus disrupted globular\nclusters could contribute most of the mass of NSCs in galaxies with stellar\nmass below 10^{11} Msun. The inner part of the accumulated cluster may seed the\ngrowth of a central black hole via stellar dynamical core collapse, thereby\nrelieving the problem of how to form luminous quasars at high redshift.

In such a scenario the Higgs mass would be protected\nfrom quantum corrections by the scale invariance of the CFT. In order for the\nStandard Model to merge into a CFT at least one new ultraviolet (UV) scale is\nrequired at which the couplings turn over from their usual Standard Model\nrunning to the fixed point behavior. We argue that the Higgs mass is sensitive\nto such a turn-over scale even if there are no associated massive particles and\nthe scale arises purely from dimensional transmutation. We demonstrate this\nsensitivity to the turnover scale explicitly in toy models. Thus if scale\ninvariance is responsible for Higgs mass naturalness, then the transition to\nCFT dynamics must occur near the TeV scale with observable consequences at\ncolliders. In addition, the UV fixed point theory in such a scenario must be\ninteracting because logarithmic running near a free fixed point constitutes\nhard breaking of scale invariance and spoils the Higgs mass protection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Jul 2013 20:08:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Aug 2013 22:22:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-22"}

An important step toward the solution of this problem is\nthe Polyakov's work on abelian confinement. The Georgi-Glashow model is a\nnatural testing ground for this mechanism which has been surprising us by its\nrichness and wide applicability. In this work, we shed light on two new aspects\nof this model in 2+1 D. First, we develop a many-body description of the\neffective degrees of freedom. Namely, we consider a non-relativistic gas of\nW-bosons in the background of monopole-instanton plasma. Many-body treatment is\na standard toolkit in condensed matter physics. However, we add a new twist by\nsupplying the monopole-instantons as external background field. Using this\nconstruction, we calculate the exact form of the potential between two electric\nprobes as a function of their separation. This potential is expressed in terms\nof the Meijer-G function which interpolates between logarithmic and linear\nbehavior at small and large distances, respectively. Second, we develop a\nsystematic approach to integrate out the effect of the W-bosons at finite\ntemperature in the range 0<T<M_W, where M_W is the W-boson mass, starting from\nthe full relativistic partition function of the Georgi-Glashow model. Using a\nheat kernel expansion that takes into account the non-trivial thermal holonomy,\nwe show that the partition function describes a three-dimensional two-component\nCoulomb gas. We repeat our analysis using the many-body description which\nyields the same result and provides a check on our formalism. At temperatures\nclose to the deconfinement temperature, the gas becomes essentially\ntwo-dimensional recovering the partition function of the dual sine-Gordon model\nthat was considered in a previous work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Jul 2013 20:09:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 Aug 2013 16:18:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

The underlying structures are typically\ncomplex and their most relevant organizational principle is the ordering of the\nties among the units they are made of according to a network displaying\nhierarchical features. In spite of the abundant presence of hierarchy no\nquantitative theoretical interpretation of the origins of a multi-level,\nknowledge-based social network exists. Here we introduce an approach which is\ncapable of reproducing the emergence of a multi-levelled network structure\nbased on the plausible assumption that the individuals (representing the nodes\nof the network) can make the right estimate about the state of their changing\nenvironment to a varying degree. Our model accounts for a fundamental feature\nof knowledge-based organizations: the less capable individuals tend to follow\nthose who are better at solving the problems they all face. We find that\nrelatively simple rules lead to hierarchical self-organization and the specific\nstructures we obtain possess the two, perhaps most important features of\ncomplex systems: a simultaneous presence of adaptability and stability. In\naddition, the performance (success score) of the emerging networks is\nsignificantly higher than the average expected score of the individuals without\nletting them copy the decisions of the others. The results of our calculations\nare in agreement with a related experiment and can be useful from the point of\ndesigning the optimal conditions for constructing a given complex social\nstructure as well as understanding the hierarchical organization of such\nbiological structures of major importance as the regulatory pathways or the\ndynamics of neural networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Jul 2013 20:27:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-05"}

Information measures, like marginal entropies, mutual and\nmulti-information, have a number of significant advantages over more standard\nstatistical methods, like their reduced sensitivity to sampling limitations\nthan statistical estimates of probability densities. There are also interesting\napplications of these measures to the theory of complexity and to statistical\nmechanics. Their mathematical properties and relationships are therefore of\ninterest at several levels.\n  Of the interesting relationships between common information measures, perhaps\nnone are more intriguing and as elegant as the duality relationships based on\nMobius inversions. These inversions are directly related to the lattices\n(posets) that describe these sets of variables and their multi-variable\nmeasures. In this paper we describe extensions of the duality previously noted\nby Bell to a range of measures, and show how the structure of the lattice\ndetermines fundamental relationships of these functions. Our major result is a\nset of interlinked duality relations among marginal entropies, interaction\ninformation, and conditional interaction information. The implications of these\nresults include a flexible range of alternative formulations of\ninformation-based measures, and a new set of sum rules that arise from\npath-independent sums on the lattice. Our motivation is to advance the\nfundamental integration of this set of ideas and relations, and to show\nexplicitly the ways in which all these measures are interrelated through\nlattice properties.

In this big ideas paper, we study the impact\nof SDN on the design of future message-oriented middleware, specifically\npub/sub systems. We argue that key concepts put forth by SDN can be applied in\na meaningful fashion to the next generation of pub/sub systems. First, pub/sub\ncan adopt a logically centralized controller model for maintenance, monitoring,\nand control of the overlay network. We establish a parallel with existing work\non centralized pub/sub routing and discuss how the logically centralized\ncontroller model can be implemented in a distributed manner. Second, we\ninvestigate the separation of the control and data plane, which is integral to\nSDN, which can be adopted to raise the level of decoupling in pub/sub. We\nintroduce a new model of pub/sub which separates the traditional publisher and\nsubscriber roles into flow regulators and producer/consumers of data.

Different from the global relationships based on the color\ndifference (photometry parameters) for samples of AGN, the more reliable\nrelationship is determined for the multi-epoch observed individual mapped QSOs\nwith no contamination from the host galaxies, the line variabilities and the\nmuch different central properties. The final confirmed results are as follows.\n(1): No strong dependence of the optical spectral index on the continuum\nluminosity can be found for all the 17 QSOs, besides two objects (PG 0026 and\nPG 1613) having some weak trends (with $3\\sigma$ confidence level) for the\nrelationship. In other words, the common sense 'AGNs get bluer when they get\nbrighter' is not so common. (2): There are much different damped intrinsic\nvariability time scales for the variability modes of the optical spectral index\nand the continuum emission, through the well applied Damped Random Walk method\nfor the AGN variability. In other words, there are some different intrinsic\nmechanisms controlling the variabilities of the optical spectral index and the\npower law AGN continuum emission. Therefore, the much weak dependence of the\noptical spectral index on the continuum luminosity can be further confirmed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Aug 2013 00:39:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

In addition to posing computational challenges, such\nlarge sample sizes call for carefully re-examining the theoretical foundation\nunderlying commonly-used analytical tools. Here, we study the accuracy of the\ncoalescent, a central model for studying the ancestry of a sample of\nindividuals. The coalescent arises as a limit of a large class of random mating\nmodels and it is an accurate approximation to the original model provided that\nthe population size is sufficiently larger than the sample size. We develop a\nmethod for performing exact computation in the discrete-time Wright-Fisher\n(DTWF) model and compare several key genealogical quantities of interest with\nthe coalescent predictions. For realistic demographic scenarios, we find that\nthere are a significant number of multiple- and simultaneous-merger events\nunder the DTWF model, which are absent in the coalescent by construction.\nFurthermore, for large sample sizes, there are noticeable differences in the\nexpected number of rare variants between the coalescent and the DTWF model. To\nbalance the tradeoff between accuracy and computational efficiency, we propose\na hybrid algorithm that utilizes the DTWF model for the recent past and the\ncoalescent for the more distant past. Our results demonstrate that the hybrid\nmethod with only a handful of generations of the DTWF model leads to a\nfrequency spectrum that is quite close to the prediction of the full DTWF\nmodel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Aug 2013 04:26:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

This paper investigates an alternative solution, which assumes\nthe availability of a full duplex (FD) receiver.

Its pre-2012 observations make\nit the best documented SN progenitor in history, but have fueled debate about\nthe nature of its 2012 explosion --- whether it was a true SN or some type of\nviolent non-terminal event. Both could power shock interaction with\ncircumstellar material (CSM), but only a core-collapse SN provides a\nself-consistent explanation. The persistent broad emission lines in the\nspectrum require a relatively large ejecta mass, and a corresponding kinetic\nenergy of at least 10^51 erg, while the faint 2012a event is consistent with\npublished models of core-collapse SNe from compact (~60 R_Sun) blue\nsupergiants. The light curves of SN 2009ip and another Type IIn, SN 2010mc,\nwere nearly identical; we demonstrate that their spectra match as well, and\nthat both are standard SNe IIn. Our observations contradict the recent claim\nthat the late-time spectrum of SN 2009ip is returning to its progenitor's\nLBV-like state, and we show that late-time spectra of SN 2009ip closely\nresemble spectra of SN 1987A. Moreover, SN 2009ip's changing H-alpha equivalent\nwidth after explosion matches behavior typically seen in core-collapse SNe IIn.\nSeveral key facts about SN 2009ip and SN 2010mc argue strongly in favor of a\ncore-collapse interpretation, and make a non-terminal 10^50 erg event\nimplausible. The most straighforward and self-consistent interpretation is that\nSN 2009ip was an initially faint core-collapse explosion of a blue supergiant\nthat produced about half as much 56-Ni as SN 1987A, with most of the peak\nluminosity from CSM interaction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Aug 2013 07:31:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 Nov 2013 21:02:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

Accretion is strongly dependent on the SED\ntype. About half of the transition objects are consistent with no accretion,\nand dust-depleted disks have weak (or undetectable) accretion signatures,\nespecially among M-type stars. The analysis of accretion and disk structure\nsuggests a parallel evolution of dust and gas. We find several distinct classes\nof evolved disks, based on SED type and accretion, pointing to different disk\ndispersal mechanisms and probably different evolutionary paths. Dust depletion\nand opening of inner holes appear to be independent processes: most transition\ndisks are not dust-depleted, and most dust-depleted disks do not require inner\nholes. The differences in disk structure between M-type and solar-type stars in\nTr37 (4 Myr) are not as remarkable as in the young, sparse, Coronet cluster\n(1-2 Myr), suggesting that other factors, like the environment/interactions,\nare likely to play a role in the disk evolution and dispersal. Finally, we also\nfind some evidence of clumpy star formation or mini-clusters within Tr37.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Aug 2013 07:49:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

This attempt, which is far from being complete, is characterized by\ntwo milestones, the Standard Model of the elementary particles and the\nEinstein's theory of General Relativity. The coupling of a quantum field\ntheory, such as the Standard Model, to a weak gravitational background provides\nsignificant information concerning the coupling of matter to gravity and allows\nto study in a systematic way the origin of the conformal anomaly. For this\nreason, the computation of correlation functions in a weak gravitational\nbackground is of remarkable interest and the consequences of this analysis are\nalso of phenomenological relevance. For instance, they concern the appearance\nin the spectrum of the theory of a composite state, the dilaton, which is\nidentified, in perturbation theory, by an infrared coupled anomaly pole. The\nstudy of some applications of the methods discussed so far is presented in the\nsecond part of this thesis. In particular it is shown that the analysis of the\nclassical metric perturbations in gravity can be related to some specific field\ntheories via a holographic mapping. This requires the computation of\ncorrelators of energy-momentum tensors in $d=3$ dimensions and plays a role in\nthe study of the non-gaussianities of the cosmic background radiation in the\nearly universe. Finally, we mention an application in momentum space of the\nconstraints derived from the conformal symmetry in the characterization of some\ncorrelation functions. This relies on the solution of a system of second order\npartial differential equations for a certain class of generalized\nhypergeometric functions of two variables.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Aug 2013 08:54:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-02"}

Balancing the load of the\nprocessing elements is key to achieving good performance and scalability. If\nthe computational costs of the individual tasks vary over time in an\nunpredictable way, dynamic load balancing aims at migrating them between\nprocessing elements so as to maintain load balance. During dynamic load\nbalancing, the tasks amount to indivisible work packets with a real-valued\ncost. For this case of indivisible, real- valued loads, we analyze the\nbalancing circuit model, a local dynamic load-balancing scheme that does not\nrequire global communication. We extend previous analyses to the present case\nand provide a probabilistic bound for the achievable load balance. Based on an\nanalogy with the offline balls-into-bins problem, we further propose a novel\nalgorithm for dynamic balancing of indivisible, real-valued loads. We benchmark\nthe proposed algorithm in numerical experiments and compare it with the\nclassical greedy algorithm, both in terms of solution quality and communication\ncost. We find that the increased communication cost of the proposed algorithm\nis compensated by a higher solution quality, leading on average to about an\norder of magnitude gain in overall performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Aug 2013 10:32:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-02"}

Seeing as the Kondo\ngap arises from many body electronic correlations, this would place SmB6 at the\nhead of a new material class: topological Kondo insulators. Here, for the first\ntime, we show that the k-space characteristics of the Kondo hybridisation\nprocess is the key to unravelling the origin of the two types of metallic\nstates observed directly by ARPES in the electronic band structure of\nSmB6(001). One group of these states is essentially of bulk origin, and cuts\nthe Fermi level due to the position of the chemical potential 20 meV above the\nlowest lying 5d-4f hybridisation zone. The other metallic state is more\nenigmatic, being weak in intensity, but represents a good candidate for a\ntopological surface state. However, before this claim can be substantiated by\nan unequivocal measurement of its massless dispersion relation, our data raises\nthe bar in terms of the ARPES resolution required, as we show there to be a\nstrong renormalisation of the hybridisation gaps by a factor 2-3 compared to\ntheory, following from the knowledge of the true position of the chemical\npotential and a careful comparison with the predictions from recent\nLDA+Gutzwiler calculations.

For example, it has been shown that giving\nreceivers the ability to do interference cancellation, or allowing transmitters\nto use power control, never decreases the capacity and can in certain cases\nincrease it by $\\Omega(\\log (\\Delta \\cdot P_{\\max}))$, where $\\Delta$ is the\nratio of the longest link length to the smallest transmitter-receiver distance\nand $P_{\\max}$ is the maximum transmission power. But there is no reason to\nexpect the optimal capacity to be realized in practice, particularly since\nmaximizing the capacity is known to be NP-hard. In reality, we would expect\nlinks to behave as self-interested agents, and thus when introducing a new\ntechnology it makes more sense to compare the values reached at game-theoretic\nequilibria than the optimum values.\n  In this paper we initiate this line of work by comparing various notions of\nequilibria (particularly Nash equilibria and no-regret behavior) when using a\nsupposedly \"better\" technology. We show a version of Braess's Paradox for all\nof them: in certain networks, upgrading technology can actually make the\nequilibria \\emph{worse}, despite an increase in the capacity. We construct\ninstances where this decrease is a constant factor for power control,\ninterference cancellation, and improvements in the SINR threshold ($\\beta$),\nand is $\\Omega(\\log \\Delta)$ when power control is combined with interference\ncancellation.

Individual integrated BF's were phase averaged to derive\na single line-strength indicator. The sample was limited to 90 EW binaries with\nthe strict phase-constancy of colors and without spectral contamination by\ncompanions. The best defined results were obtained for a F-type sub-sample\n(0.32<(B-V)0<0.62) of 52 stars for which the BF strengths could be interpolated\nin the model predictions. The metallicities, [M/H], for the F-type sub-sample\nindicate abundances roughly similar to the solar [M/H], but with a large\nscatter which is partly due to combined random and systematic errors. Because\nof a color trend resulting from limitations in our approach, we set the scale\nof metallicities to correspond to that derived from the m_1 index of the\nStromgren photometry for F-type binaries. The trend-adjusted [M/H]1 are\ndistributed within -0.65<[M/H]1<+0.50, with the spread reflecting genuine\nmetallicity differences between stars. One half of the F-sub-sample binaries\nhave [M/H]1 within -0.37<[M/H]1 +0.10, a median of -0.04 and a mean of -0.10,\nwith a tail towards low metallicities, and a possible bias against very high\nmetallicities. A parallel study of kinematic data, utilizing the most reliable\nand recently obtained proper motion and radial velocity data for 78 stars of\nthe full sample, shows that the F-type sub-sample binaries have similar\nkinematic properties to solar neighborhood, thin-disk dwarfs with ages about 3\n- 5.5 Gyr.

Our algorithm allows for a continuous\ninterpolation between the fast RRT algorithm and the asymptotically optimal\nRRT* and RRG algorithms. When the approximation factor is 1 (i.e., no\napproximation is allowed), LBT-RRT behaves like RRG. When the approximation\nfactor is unbounded, LBT-RRT behaves like RRT. In between, LBT-RRT is shown to\nproduce paths that have higher quality than RRT would produce and run faster\nthan RRT* would run. This is done by maintaining a tree which is a sub-graph of\nthe RRG roadmap and a second, auxiliary graph, which we call the lower-bound\ngraph. The combination of the two roadmaps, which is faster to maintain than\nthe roadmap maintained by RRT*, efficiently guarantees asymptotic\nnear-optimality.

Implicitly, the whole set is assumed to contain at least two\npoints.\n  The hypothesis that the answer to that question is positive became famous\nunder the name Borsuk's conjecture. Beginning with Jeff Kahn and Gil Kalai,\nfrom 1993 to 2003 several authors have proved that in certain (almost all) high\ndimensions such a division is not generally possible.\n  In a paper published in 2013, Andriy V.

As solar cells approach fundamental efficiency\nlimits, their internal physics transforms. Photonic considerations, instead of\nelectronic ones, are the key to reaching the highest voltages and efficiencies.\nProper photon management led to Alta Device's recent dramatic increase of the\nsolar cell efficiency record to 28.3%. Moreover, approaching the\nShockley-Queisser limit for any solar cell technology will require light\nextraction to become a part of all future designs.\n  The second half of the dissertation introduces inverse design as a new\ncomputational paradigm in photonics. An assortment of techniques (FDTD, FEM,\netc.) have enabled quick and accurate simulation of the \"forward problem\" of\nfinding fields for a given geometry. However, scientists and engineers are\ntypically more interested in the inverse problem: for a desired functionality,\nwhat geometry is needed?

A widely-held belief takes for\ngranted that this sequence can be connected by a moving pole in the complex\nangular momentum (CAM) plane, which gives rise to a linear trajectory of the\nform $J = \\alpha_0+\\alpha' m^2$, $\\alpha'\\sim 1/(\\mathrm{GeV})^2$, which is the\nstandard expression of the Regge pole trajectory.

(c) The Sommerfeld pole which\nis closest to the real axis of the CAM-plane is dominant at large angles, and\ndescribes in a proper way the backward diffractive peak in both the following\ncases: at fixed $k$, as a function of the scattering angle, and at fixed\nscattering angle $\\theta=\\pi$, as a function of $k$.

This paper tracks the growth curves of all 20,000\npetitions to the UK government petitions website\n(http://epetitions.direct.gov.uk) and 1,800 petitions to the US White House\nsite (https://petitions.whitehouse.gov), analyzing the rate of growth and\noutreach mechanism. Previous research has suggested the importance of the first\nday to the ultimate success of a petition, but has not examined early growth\nwithin that day, made possible here through hourly resolution in the data. The\nanalysis shows that the vast majority of petitions do not achieve any measure\nof success; over 99 percent fail to get the 10,000 signatures required for an\nofficial response and only 0.1 percent attain the 100,000 required for a\nparliamentary debate (0.7 percent in the US).

We define and measure an average outreach\nfactor for petitions and show that it decays very fast (reducing to 0.1 pervent\nafter 10 hours in the UK and 30 hours in the US).

We present a 3D particle\nmodel of the dynamics of the escaping atoms, and calculate theoretical Ly-alpha\nabsorption line profiles, which can be directly compared with the absorption\nobserved in the blue wing of the line. For HD209458b the observed velocities of\nthe escaping atoms up to -130km/s are naturally explained by radiation-pressure\nacceleration. The observations are well-fitted with an ionizing flux of about\n3-4 times solar and a hydrogen escape rate in the range 10^9-10^11g/s, in\nagreement with theoretical predictions. For HD189733b absorption by neutral\nhydrogen was observed in 2011 in the velocity range -230 to -140km/s. These\nvelocities are higher than for HD209458b and require an additional acceleration\nmechanism for the escaping hydrogen atoms, which could be interactions with\nstellar wind protons. We constrain the stellar wind (temperature ~3x10^4K,\nvelocity 200+-20km/s and density in the range 10^3-10^7/cm3) as well as the\nescape rate (4x10^8-10^11g/s) and ionizing flux (6-23 times solar). We also\nreveal the existence of an 'escape-limited' saturation regime in which most of\nthe escaping gas interacts with the stellar protons. In this regime, which\noccurs at proton densities above ~3x10^5/cm3, the amplitude of the absorption\nsignature is limited by the escape rate and does not depend on the wind\ndensity. The non-detection of escaping hydrogen in earlier observations in 2010\ncan be explained by the suppression of the stellar wind at that time, or an\nescape rate of about an order of magnitude lower than in 2011. For both\nplanets, best-fit simulations show that the escaping atmosphere has the shape\nof a cometary tail.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Aug 2013 12:27:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

The existence of bound and unbound terrestrial\nplanets with liquid water is an important question, and of particular\nimportance is the question of their habitability. Even for a globally\nice-covered planet, geothermal heat from the planetary interior may melt the\ninterior ice, creating an internal ocean covered by an ice shell. In this\npaper, we discuss the conditions that terrestrial planets must satisfy for such\nan internal ocean to exist on the timescale of planetary evolution. The\nquestion is addressed in terms of planetary mass, distance from a central star,\nwater abundance, and abundance of radiogenic heat sources. In addition, we\ninvestigate the structures of the surface-H2O layers of ice-covered planets by\nconsidering the effects of ice under high pressure (high-pressure ice). As a\nfiducial case, 1M$\\oplus$ planet at 1 AU from its central star and with 0.6 to\n25 times the H2O mass of Earth could have an internal ocean. We find that\nhigh-pressure ice layers may appear between the internal ocean and the rock\nportion on a planet with an H2O mass over 25 times that of Earth. The planetary\nmass and abundance of surface water strongly restrict the conditions under\nwhich an extrasolar terrestrial planet may have an internal ocean with no\nhigh-pressure ice under the ocean. Such high-pressure-ice layers underlying the\ninternal ocean are likely to affect the habitability of the planet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Aug 2013 11:24:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}
