However, when PA is\nknown to be unbiased, the complexity of its estimators often does not scale\nwith the system's size. The purpose of this paper is to suggest an alternative\napproach to optimization which balances precision with computing efforts by\ntrading off complicated, unbiased PA estimators for simple, biased approximate\nestimators. Furthermore, we provide guidelines for developing such estimators,\nthat are largely based on the Stochastic Flow Modeling framework. We suggest\nthat if the relative error (or bias) is not too large, then optimization\nalgorithms such as stochastic approximation converge to a (local) minimum just\nlike in the case where no approximation is used. We apply this approach to an\nexample of balancing loss with buffer-cost in a finite-buffer queue, and prove\na crucial upper bound on the relative error.

An outstanding challenge is the extension of the results achieved\nfor static networks to time-varying networks, where the topological structure\nof the system and the temporal activity patterns of its components are\nintertwined. Here we investigate the use of a latent factor decomposition\ntechnique, non-negative tensor factorization, to extract the community-activity\nstructure of temporal networks. The method is intrinsically temporal and allows\nto simultaneously identify communities and to track their activity over time.\nWe represent the time-varying adjacency matrix of a temporal network as a\nthree-way tensor and approximate this tensor as a sum of terms that can be\ninterpreted as communities of nodes with an associated activity time series. We\nsummarize known computational techniques for tensor decomposition and discuss\nsome quality metrics that can be used to tune the complexity of the factorized\nrepresentation. We subsequently apply tensor factorization to a temporal\nnetwork for which a ground truth is available for both the community structure\nand the temporal activity patterns. The data we use describe the social\ninteractions of students in a school, the associations between students and\nschool classes, and the spatio-temporal trajectories of students over time. We\nshow that non-negative tensor factorization is capable of recovering the class\nstructure with high accuracy.

Sketch Pad ND offers\ntwo visualization paradigms, one based on parallel coordinates and the other\nbased on a relatively new framework using an N-D polygon to navigate in\nhigh-dimensional space. The first interface allows users to draw arbitrary\nprofiles of probability density functions along each dimension axis and sketch\nshapes for data density and connections between adjacent dimensions. The second\ninterface embraces the idea of sculpting. Users can carve data at arbitrary\norientations and refine them wherever necessary.

The fundamental principle underlying\ncomplex resource-allocation dynamics is Boolean interactions associated with\nminority games, as resources are generally limited and agents tend to choose\nthe least used resource based on available information. A common but harmful\ndynamical behavior in resource-allocation systems is herding, where there are\ntime intervals during which a large majority of the agents compete for a few\nresources, leaving many other resources unused. Ac- companying the herd\nbehavior is thus strong fluctuations with time in the number of resources being\nused. In this paper, we articulate and establish that an intuitive control\nstrategy, namely pinning control, is effective at harnessing the herding\ndynamics. In particular, by fixing the choices of resources for a few agents\nwhile leaving majority of the agents free, herding can be eliminated\ncompletely. Our investigation is systematic in that we consider random and\ntargeted pinning and a variety of network topologies, and we carry out a\ncomprehensive analysis in the framework of mean-field theory to understand the\nworking of control. The basic philosophy is then that, when a few agents waive\ntheir freedom to choose resources by receiving sufficient incentives, majority\nof the agents benefit in that they will make fair, efficient, and effective use\nof the available resources. Our work represents a basic and general framework\nto address the fundamental issue of fluctuations in complex dynamical systems\nwith significant applications to social, economical and political systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Aug 2013 01:34:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-06"}

In practice, however, a bank default has an externality in that it\nundermines other banks' balance sheets. This paper explores how each of these\ndifferent sources of risk, simultaneity risk and externality, contributes to\nsystemic risk. The results show that the allocation of external assets that\nminimizes systemic risk varies with the topology of the financial network as\nlong as asset returns have negative correlations. In the model, a well-known\ncentrality measure, PageRank, reflects an appropriately defined \"infectiveness\"\nof a bank. An important result is that the most infective bank need not always\nbe the safest bank. Under certain circumstances, the most infective node should\nact as a firewall to prevent large-scale collective defaults. The introduction\nof a counteractive portfolio structure will significantly reduce systemic risk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Aug 2013 02:47:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-30"}

To guarantee convergence for such systems, it is common in\nthe literature to assume that the vector field of each agent is pointing inside\nthe convex hull formed by the states of the agent and its neighbors, given that\nthe relative states between each agent and its neighbors are available. This\nconvexity condition is relaxed in this paper, as we show that it is enough that\nthe vector field belongs to a strict tangent cone based on a local supporting\nhyperrectangle. The new condition has the natural physical interpretation of\nrequiring shared reference directions in addition to the available local\nrelative states. Such shared reference directions can be further interpreted as\nif each agent holds a magnetic compass indicating the orientations of a global\nframe. It is proven that the cooperative multi-agent system achieves\nexponential state agreement if and only if the time-varying interaction graph\nis uniformly jointly quasi-strongly connected. Cooperative--antagonistic\nmulti-agent systems are also considered. For these systems, the relation has a\nnegative sign for arcs corresponding to antagonistic interactions. State\nagreement may not be achieved, but instead it is shown that all the agents'\nstates asymptotically converge, and their limits agree componentwise in\nabsolute values if and in general only if the time-varying interaction graph is\nuniformly jointly strongly connected.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Aug 2013 14:27:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 5 Nov 2014 12:26:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 5 Aug 2015 04:43:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-06"}

It has 2 interior and exterior horizons. Using\nBekenestein-Hawking entropy theorem we calculate interior and exterior entropy,\ntemperature, Gibbs free energy and heat capacity at constant electric charge.\nWe calculate first derivative of the Gibbs free energy with respect to\ntemperature which become a singular function having a singularity at critical\npoint with corresponding temperature $T_c=\\frac{1}{24\\pi \\sqrt{3}|e|}.$ Hence\nwe clime first order phase transition is happened there. Temperature same as\nGibbs free energy takes absolutely positive (negative) values on the exterior\n(interior) horizon. The Gibbs free energy takes two different positive values\nsynchronously for $0<T<T_c$ but not for negative values which means the system\nis made from two subsystem. For negative temperatures entropy reaches to zero\nvalue at $T\\to-\\infty$ and so takes Bose-Einstein condensation single state.\nEntropy increases monotonically in case $0<T<T_c$. Regarding results of the\nwork presented at Ref. \\citep{Bob01} we calculate again the mentioned\nthermodynamical variables for remnant stable final state of evaporating QRNBH\nand obtained results same as one in case of the CRNBH. Finally, we solve mass\nloss equation of QRNBH against advance Eddington-Finkelstein time coordinate\nand derive luminosity function. We obtain switching off of QRNBH evaporation\nbefore than the mass completely vanishes.
