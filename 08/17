Our inspiration comes on the one hand from a\ncorresponding upper bound for the area in terms of the charges obtained\nrecently by Dain, Jaramillo and Reiris [1] in the pure Einstein-Maxwell case\nwithout symmetries, and on the other hand from Yazadjiev's inequality [2] in\nthe axially symmetric Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton case. The common issue in these\nproofs and in the present one is a functional ${\\mathscr W}$ of the matter\nfields for which the stability condition readily yields an {\\it upper} bound.\nOn the other hand, the step which crucially depends on whether or not a dilaton\nfield is present is to obtain a {\\it lower} bound for ${\\mathscr W}$ as well.\nWe obtain the latter by first setting up a variational principle for ${\\mathscr\nW}$ with respect to the dilaton field $\\phi$, then by proving existence of a\nminimizer $\\psi$ as solution of the corresponding Euler-Lagrange equations and\nfinally by estimating ${\\mathscr W}(\\psi)$. In the special case that the normal\ncomponents of the electric and magnetic fields are proportional we obtain the\narea bound $A \\ge 8\\pi P Q$ in terms of the electric and magnetic charges. In\nthe generic case our results are less explicit but imply rigorous\n`perturbation' results for the above inequality. All our inequalities are\nsaturated for a 2-parameter family of static, extreme solutions found by\nGibbons [3]. Via the Bekenstein-Hawking relation $A = 4S$ our results give\npositive lower bounds for the entropy $S$ which are particularly interesting in\nthe Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Aug 2013 16:02:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 Aug 2013 12:05:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 30 Oct 2014 12:31:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-01"}

Favorable conditions for merger are initiated by the Kozai\nresonance in which the gravitational interaction with a third distant object,\ntypically another BH, induces quasi-periodic variations of the inner BH binary\neccentricity. In this paper we perform high precision N-body simulations of the\nlong term evolution of hierarchical BH triples and investigate the conditions\nthat lead to the merging of the BH binary and the way it might become an\nobservable source of GW radiation. We find that the secular orbit average\ntreatment, adopted in previous works, does not reliably describe the dynamics\nof these systems if the binary is orbited by the outer BH on a highly inclined\norbit at a moderate distance. During the high eccentricity phase of a Kozai\ncycle the torque due to the outer BH can drive the binary to extremely large\neccentricities in a fraction of the binary's orbital period. This occurs before\nrelativistic terms become important to the evolution and allows the binary GW\nsignal to reach large GW frequencies (>~10 Hz) at high eccentricities. We show\nthat ~50 % of coalescing BH binaries driven by the Kozai mechanism in GCs will\nhave eccentricities larger than 0.1, with 10 % of them being extremely\neccentric, (1-e)<~10^-5, when they first chirp in the frequency band of ground\nbased laser interferometers. This implies that a large fraction of such GW\nsources could be missed if conventional quasi-circular templates are used for\nanalysis of GW detectors data. The efficient detection of all coalescing BH\nbinaries in GCs will therefore require template banks of eccentric inspiral\nwaveforms for matched-filtering and dedicated search strategies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Aug 2013 17:30:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 Nov 2013 11:16:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

These bumps occurred synchronously in all UV and optical bands with\namplitudes of 0.1 -- 0.4 mag at intervals of 10 -- 30 days. Episodic continuum\nbrightening and dimming in the UV and optical with these characteristics is not\neasilly explained within the context of models that have been proposed for the\nlate September 2012 outburst of SN 2009ip.

Ultracold quantum gases offer tremendous promise for this\napplication largely due to an unprecedented control over interactions.\nSpecifically, $a$, the two-body scattering length that characterizes the\ninteraction strength, can be tuned to any value.

The detached-shell source R Scl, displaying CO\nemission from recent mass loss, in a binary-induced spiral structure as well as\nin a clumpy shell produced during a thermal pulse, provides a unique laboratory\nfor studying the differences in CO isotope abundances throughout its recent\nevolution. We observed both the 12CO(J=3-2) and the 13CO(J=3-2) line using\nALMA. We find significant variations in the 12CO/13CO intensity ratios and\nconsequently in the abundance ratios. The average CO isotope abundance ratio is\nat least a factor three lower in the shell (~19) than that in the present-day\n(<300 years) mass loss (>60). Additionally, variations in the ratio of more\nthan an order of magnitude are found in the shell itself. We attribute these\nvariations to the competition between selective dissociation and isotope\nfractionation in the shell, of which large parts cannot be warmer than ~35 K.\nHowever, we also find that the 12CO/13CO ratio in the present-day mass loss is\nsignificantly higher than the 12C/13C ratio determined in the stellar\nphotosphere from molecular tracers (~19).

To validate the theory, we compute radial\ndistribution functions of binary mixtures of oppositely charged colloidal\nmacroions from molecular dynamics simulations of the coarse-grained model (with\nimplicit microions), taking effective pair potentials as input. Our results\nagree closely with corresponding results from more computationally intensive\nMonte Carlo simulations of the primitive model (with explicit microions).\nSimulations of a mixture with large size and charge asymmetries indicate that\ncharged nanoparticles can enhance electrostatic screening of charged colloids.\nThe theory presented here lays a foundation for future large-scale modeling of\ncomplex mixtures of charged colloids, nanoparticles, and polyelectrolytes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Aug 2013 20:11:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-20"}

The search for a Majorana Fermion has recently shifted to topological\nsuperconductivity. Topological superconductors are categorized by the\nnontrivial wind- ing of their order parameter phase and for this reason are\nexpected to support Majorana Fermions in their vortex cores. Owing to this, the\nstudy of topological superconductors has intensified in recent years. Current\nproposals for a device that may behave as a topological superconductor are\nbased on semiconductor heterostructures, where the spin-orbit coupled bands of\na semiconductor are split by a band gap or Zeeman field and superconductivity\nis induced by proximity to a conventional superconductor. In this setup,\ntopological superconductivity is obtained in the semiconductor layer and the\nproposed heterostructures typically include two or three layers of different\nmaterials.

This digraph\ngenerally has some of its nodes corresponding to hidden variables. We seek to\nclarify for which mixed graphs there exists an acyclic digraph whose hidden\nvariable model coincides with the mixed graph model. Restricting to the\ntractable setting of chain graphs and multivariate normality, we show that\ndecomposability of the bidirected part of the chain graph is necessary and\nsufficient for equality between the mixed graph model and some hidden variable\nmodel given by an acyclic digraph.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Aug 2013 21:54:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-20"}

Most EPS models are still\npoorly calibrated for certain stellar evolution stages, especially for the\ntreatment of binary stars, which are very different from single stars. We aim\nto present color-magnitude (C-M) and color-color (C-C) relations for passive\nmodel galaxies in the redshift z$\\sim0.0-3.0$ and to study the effect of binary\ninteractions on these relations for high-redshift passive galaxies. Assuming\nexponentially declining star formation rate, we used a set of theoretical\ngalaxy templates obtained from Yunnan EPS models (with and without binary\ninteractions) to present the C-M and C-C relations for passive galaxies via\nMonte Carlo simulation. In Yunnan EPS models with binary interactions, various\nprocesses are included, such as mass transfer, mass accretion, common-envelope\nevolution, collisions, supernova kicks, tidal evolution, and all angular\nmomentum loss mechanisms. In these models, approximately 50 per cent of the\nstellar systems are binary systems with orbital periods less than 100\\,yr. This\nfraction is a typical value for the Milky Way. We find that the inclusion of\nbinary interactions in the model galaxies' spectra can dramatically alter the\npredicted C-M and C-C relations and their evolution with redshift. For $z\\sim\n0.0$ and $1.0$, the binary interactions have a minor effect on the C-M and C-C\nrelations, but at $z\\sim 2.0$ and $3.0$ the binary interactions have a major\neffect on the C-M and C-C relations.

In\naddition to the two parameters defined for the entanglement classification of\nthe symmetric pure states based on MR, namely, diversity degree and degeneracy\nconfiguration, we show that another parameter called rank needs to be\nintroduced for symmetric mixed state classification.

This spin\ncurrent is transformed into electrical charge current by means of the ISHE. An\nincrease of the ISHE-voltage with increasing film thickness is observed and\ncompared to the theoretically expected behavior.

We assume that the propagation power follows an upward\ndrifting Brownian motion between cascades, and drops discontinuously each time\na cascade occurs. Cascades are described by a continuous state branching\nprocess with distributional properties determined by the value of the\npropagation power when they occur. In common with many cascading models, pure\npower law behaviour is exhibited at a critical level of propagation power, and\nthe mean cascade size diverges.

We model aggregation of the pea\naphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum. Specifically, we conduct experiments to track the\nmotion of aphids walking in a featureless circular arena in order to deduce\nindividual-level rules. We observe that each aphid transitions stochastically\nbetween a moving and a stationary state. Moving aphids follow a correlated\nrandom walk. The probabilities of motion state transitions, as well as the\nrandom walk parameters, depend strongly on distance to an aphid's nearest\nneighbor. For large nearest neighbor distances, when an aphid is essentially\nisolated, its motion is ballistic with aphids moving faster, turning less, and\nbeing less likely to stop. In contrast, for short nearest neighbor distances,\naphids move more slowly, turn more, and are more likely to become stationary;\nthis behavior constitutes an aggregation mechanism. From the experimental data,\nwe estimate the state transition probabilities and correlated random walk\nparameters as a function of nearest neighbor distance. With the\nindividual-level model established, we assess whether it reproduces the\nmacroscopic patterns of movement at the group level. To do so, we consider\nthree distributions, namely distance to nearest neighbor, angle to nearest\nneighbor, and percentage of population moving at any given time. For each of\nthese three distributions, we compare our experimental data to the output of\nnumerical simulations of our nearest neighbor model, and of a control model in\nwhich aphids do not interact socially.
