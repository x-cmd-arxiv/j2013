It has a prevalence that ranges between 2 and 150 per 100 000.\nEpidemiological studies of MS have provided hints on possible causes for the\ndisease ranging from genetic, environmental and infectious factors to other\nfactors of vascular origin. Despite the tremendous effort spent in the last few\nyears, none of the hypotheses formulated so far has gained wide acceptance and\nthe causes of the disease remain unknown. From a clinical point of view, a high\ncorrelation has been recently observed between MS and Chronic Cerebro-Spinal\nVenous Insufficiency (CCSVI) in a statistically significant number of patients.\nIn this pathological situation CCSVI may induce alterations of blood pressure\nin brain microvessels, thereby perturbing the exchange of small hydrophilic\nmolecules between the blood and the external cells. In the presence of large\npressure alterations it cannot be excluded also the leakage of macromolecules\nthat otherwise would not cross the vessel wall. All these disorders may trigger\nimmune defenses with the destruction of myelin as a side effect. In the present\nwork we investigate the role of perturbed blood pressure in brain microvessels\nas driving force for an altered exchange of small hydrophilic solutes and\nleakage of macromolecules into the interstitial fluid. With a simplified, yet\nrealistic, model we obtain closed-form steady-state solutions for fluid flow\nand solute transport across the microvessel wall. Finally, we use these results\n(i) to interpret experimental data available in the literature and (ii) to\ncarry out a preliminary analysis of the disorder in the exchange processes\ntriggered by an increase of blood pressure, thereby relating our preliminary\nresults to the hypothesised vascular connection to MS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Aug 2013 16:21:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 22 Aug 2013 08:49:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-23"}

The time\ntaken to fall along the diameter is found to be 38 rather than 42 minutes. The\ntime taken to fall along a straight line between any two points is no longer\nindependent of distance, but interpolates between 42 minutes for short trips\nand 38 minutes for long trips. The brachistochrone path (minimizing the fall\ntime between any two points) is similar to the uniform density solution, but\ntends to reach a greater maximum depth and takes less time to traverse.\nAlthough the assumption of uniform density works well in many cases, the\nsimpler assumption of a constant gravitational field serves as a better\napproximation to the true results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Aug 2013 16:40:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-24"}

Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that the nervous system\nboth has knowledge of, and uses the limb with the best proprioceptive acuity\nfor bimanual proprioception. Surprisingly, a Bayesian model that postulates\noptimal combination of sensory signals could not predict empirically observed\nbimanual acuity. These findings suggest that while the central nervous system\nseems to have information about the relative sensory acuity of each limb, it\nuses this information in a rather rudimentary fashion, essentially ignoring\ninformation from the less reliable limb.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Aug 2013 17:18:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-10"}

Although\nthe origin of the hardening is not clearly understood, possible explanations\ninclude hardening in the cosmic-ray source spectrum, changes in the cosmic-ray\npropagation properties in the Galaxy and the effect of nearby sources. In this\ncontribution, we propose that the spectral anomaly might be an effect of\nre-acceleration of cosmic rays by weak shocks in the Galaxy. After acceleration\nby strong supernova remnant shock waves, cosmic rays undergo diffusive\npropagation through the Galaxy. During the propagation, cosmic rays may again\nencounter expanding supernova remnant shock waves, and get re-accelerated. As\nthe probability of encountering old supernova remnants is expected to be larger\nthan the young ones due to their bigger size, re-acceleration is expected to be\nproduced mainly by weaker shocks. Since weaker shocks generate a softer\nparticle spectrum, the resulting re-accelerated component will have a spectrum\nsteeper than the initial cosmic-ray source spectrum produced by strong shocks.\nFor a reasonable set of model parameters, it is shown that such re-accelerated\ncomponent can dominate the GeV energy region while the non-reaccelerated\ncomponent dominates at higher energies, explaining the observed GeV-TeV\nspectral anomaly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Aug 2013 17:40:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-07"}

The motivation for this project is the\nrecent discovery by Randall et al. (2011), of four rapidly pulsating sdO stars\nin the globular cluster Omega Cen, with Teff near 50,000 K, 5.4 < log g < 6.0,\nand hydrogen-rich atmospheres. The only previously known sdO pulsator is\nsignificantly hotter at 68,500 K and log g = 6.1. All of the sdO pulsators\nidentified so far are fainter than 17.4 in the V band and, thus, are poor\ncandidates for an in-depth follow-up with asteroseismology. We therefore\nobtained high S/N light curves and spectroscopy for a number of field sdO stars\nto attempt to discover bright counterparts to these stars, particularly the\nOmega Cen pulsators. Our primary sample consisted of 19 sdO stars with\nhydrogen-rich atmospheres, log N(He)/N(H) < -1.0, effective temperatures in the\nrange 40,000 K < Teff < 67,000 K, and surface gravities 5.3 < log g < 6.1. We\nalso observed 17 additional helium-rich sdO stars with log N(He)/N(H) > -0.1\nand similar temperatures and gravities. To date, we have found no detectable\npulsations at amplitudes above 0.08% (4 times the mean noise level) in any of\nthe 36 field sdO stars that we observed. The presence of pulsations in Omega\nCen sdO stars and their apparent absence in seemingly comparable field sdO\nstars is perplexing. While very suggestive, the significance of this result is\ndifficult to assess more completely right now due to remaining uncertainties\nabout the temperature width and purity of the Omega Cen instability strip and\nthe existence of any sdO pulsators with weaker amplitudes than the current\ndetection limit in globular clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Aug 2013 18:42:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-07"}

In this paper, we explore Bayesian method of ensemble learning for image\ndenoising. Ensemble methods seek to combine multiple different algorithms to\nretain the strengths of all methods and the weaknesses of none. Bayesian\nensemble models are Non-local Means and Fields of Experts, the very successful\nrecent algorithms. The Non-local Means presumes that the image contains an\nextensive amount of self-similarity.

When present in a given\nstellar population, these stars leave unique signatures that can be used to\ndetect them unambiguously. However, these models have to be tested in a\nhomogeneous database of star-forming galaxies, to check if the results are\nconsistent with what is found from different wavelength ranges. In this work we\nperformed stellar population synthesis on the nuclear and extended regions of\n23 star-forming galaxies to understand how the star-formation tracers in the\nnear-infrared can be used in practice. The stellar population synthesis shows\nthat for the galaxies with strong emission in the NIR, there is an important\nfraction of young/intermediate population contributing to the spectra, which is\nprobably the ionisation source in these galaxies. Galaxies that had no emission\nlines measured in the NIR were found to have older average ages and less\ncontribution of young populations. Although the stellar population synthesis\nmethod proved to be very effective to find the young ionising population in\nthese galaxies, no clear correlation between these results and the NIR spectral\nindexes were found. Thus, we believe that, in practice, the use of these\nindexes is still very limited due to observational limitations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Aug 2013 19:18:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

The result for this query is a\ncount of the number of people in the database whose attribute vector restricted\nto $S$ agrees with $\\beta$.\n  Privately releasing approximate answers to a set of $k$-way marginal queries\nis one of the most important and well-motivated problems in differential\nprivacy. Information theoretically, the error complexity of marginal queries is\nwell-understood: the per-query additive error is known to be at least\n$\\Omega(\\min\\{\\sqrt{n},d^{\\frac{k}{2}}\\})$ and at most\n$\\tilde{O}(\\min\\{\\sqrt{n} d^{1/4},d^{\\frac{k}{2}}\\})$. However, no polynomial\ntime algorithm with error complexity as low as the information theoretic upper\nbound is known for small $n$.

This error\nbound is as good as the best known information theoretic upper bounds for\n$k=2$. This bound is an improvement over previous work on efficiently releasing\nmarginals when $k$ is small and when error $o(n)$ is desirable. Using private\nboosting we are also able to give nearly matching worst-case error bounds.\n  Our algorithms are based on the geometric techniques of Nikolov, Talwar, and\nZhang. The main new ingredients are convex relaxations and careful use of the\nFrank-Wolfe algorithm for constrained convex minimization. To design our\nrelaxations, we rely on the Grothendieck inequality from functional analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Aug 2013 19:29:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-07"}

We focus on a sample of ~50 extragalactic UCDs for which velocity\ndispersions and structural parameters have been measured. METHODS: Using\nup-to-date distance moduli and a consistent treatment of aperture and seeing\neffects, we calculate the ratio Psi=(M/L)_{dyn}/(M/L)_{pop} between the\ndynamical and the stellar population M/L of UCDs. For all UCDs with Psi>1 we\nestimate the mass of a hypothetical central BH needed to reproduce the observed\nintegrated velocity dispersion. RESULTS: Massive UCDs (M>10^7 M_*) have an\naverage Psi = 1.7 +-0.2, implying notable amounts of dark mass in them. We find\nthat, on average, central BH masses of 10-15% of the UCD mass can explain these\nelevated dynamical M/L ratios.

While the optimal MAB strategy remains to be\ndetermined, a number of algorithms have been developed in an effort to maximize\nthe winnings. Here, based on this resemblance, we tackle the search for IGW B\nmodes with single frequency experiments in the presence of spatially-varying\nforegrounds by developing adaptive survey strategies to optimize the\nsensitivity to IGW B modes. We demonstrate, using realistic foreground models\nand taking lensing-induced B modes into account, that adaptive experiments can\nsubstantially improve the upper bound on the tensor-to-scalar ratio (by factors\nof 2--3 in single frequency experiments, and possibly even more). Similar\ntechniques can be applied to other surveys, including 21-cm measurements of\nsignatures of the epoch of reionization, searches for a stochastic primordial\ngravitational wave background, deep-field imaging by the James Webb Space\nTelescope or various radio interferometers, and transient follow-up searches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Aug 2013 20:00:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 26 Aug 2015 15:02:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-27"}

We study the effect of the environmental\nanisotropy on the observed Lya emission by performing radiative transfer\ncalculations for models of neutral hydrogen clouds with prescriptions of\nspatial and kinematic anisotropies. The environmental anisotropy leads to\ncorresponding anisotropy in the Lya flux and spectral properties and induces\ncorrelations among them. The Lya flux (or observed luminosity) depends on the\nviewing angle and shows an approximate correlation with the initial Lya optical\ndepth in the viewing direction relative to those in all other directions. The\ndistribution of Lya flux from a set of randomly oriented clouds is skewed to\nhigh values, providing a natural contribution to the Lya equivalent width (EW)\ndistribution seen in observation. A narrower EW distribution is found at a\nlarger peak offset of the Lya line, similar to the trend suggested in\nobservation. The peak offset appears to correlate with the line shape (full\nwidth at half maximum and asymmetry), pointing to a possibility of using Lya\nline features alone to determine the systemic redshifts of galaxies. The study\nsuggests that anisotropies in the spatial and kinematic distributions of\nneutral hydrogen can be an important ingredient in shaping the observed\nproperties of Lya emission from star-forming galaxies.

Two- dimensional triangular domain problems, alias td-problems,\nare a particular case of interest.

We further argue that while thermally activated rheology\nnaturally gives rise to logarithmic steady-state velocity-strengthening\nfriction, a crossover to stronger-than-logarithmic strengthening might take\nplace at higher slip velocities, possibly accompanied by a change in the\ndominant dissipation mechanism. We sketch a few physical mechanisms that may\naccount for the crossover to stronger-than-logarithmic steady-state\nvelocity-strengthening and compile a rather extensive set of experimental data\navailable in the literature, lending support to these ideas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Aug 2013 20:51:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Apr 2014 21:35:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-17"}

This assumption is reasonable if the reflections\nfrom the detectors and surrounding surfaces can be neglected or filtered out\n(for example, by time-gating). However, when the object is surrounded by\nacoustically hard detector arrays, and/or by additional acoustic mirrors, the\nacoustic waves will undergo multiple reflections. (In the absence of absorption\nthey would bounce around in such a reverberant cavity forever). This disallows\nthe use of the existing free-space reconstruction techniques. This paper\nproposes a fast iterative reconstruction algorithm for measurements made at the\nwalls of a rectangular reverberant cavity. We prove the convergence of the\niterations under a certain sufficient condition, and demonstrate the\neffectiveness and efficiency of the algorithm in numerical simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Aug 2013 20:55:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

The accretion disk luminosity and jet power, on the other hand, have\nlong been observed to follow a linear correlation. If jet power is coupled to\nblack hole spin, deviations from the jet-disk correlation for a sample of AGN\ncan be used to probe the dispersion of the spin parameter within this sample.\nTo exploit this idea, we matched double-lobed radio sources from the FIRST\nsurvey to spectroscopically confirmed quasars from SDSS. We obtain 763 FR-II\nquasars with a median redshift of z=1.2 A tight correlation between the optical\nluminosity of the accretion disk and the lobe radio luminosity is observed. We\nestimate that 5-20% of the bolometric disk luminosity is converted to jet\npower. Most of the scatter to the optical-radio correlation is due to\nenvironment; deviations from jet-disk coupling due to internal factors (e.g.,\nspin) contribute at most 0.2 dex. Under the assumption that the\nBlandford-Znajek mechanism operates in AGN, we obtain an upper limit of 0.1 dex\nto the dispersion of the product of the spin and the magnetic flux threading\nthe horizon. If black hole spin determines the AGN jet efficiency, then our\nobservations imply that all FR-II quasars have very similar spin. In addition,\nthe quasar spin distribution needs to have a wide gap to explain the\nradio-quiet population. The alternative, and perhaps more likely,\ninterpretation of the tight jet-disk correlation is that black hole spin is not\nrelevant for powering AGN jets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Aug 2013 22:46:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

This limit arises from a trade-off between the removal of extrinsic\nnoise in the receptor and intrinsic noise in the downstream network.\nNon-equilibrium systems can lift this trade-off by storing the receptor state\nover time in chemical modification states of downstream molecules. As we\nquantify for a push-pull network, this requires i) time and receptors; ii)\ndownstream molecules; iii) energy (fuel turnover) to drive modification. These\nthree resource classes cannot compensate each other, and it is the limiting\nclass which sets the fundamental sensing limit. Within each class, trade-offs\nare possible. Energy allows a power-speed trade-off, while time can be traded\nagainst receptors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Aug 2013 00:06:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 Jan 2014 17:31:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-31"}

Here we\nintroduce a new approach to this issue, and demonstrate its utility on three\nmammalian transcriptional enhancers. Using results from saturation mutagenesis\nstudies of these enhancers, we classified all possible point mutations as\nup-regulating, down-regulating, or silent, and determined which of these\nmutations have occurred on each branch of a phylogeny. Applying a framework\nanalogous to Ka/Ks in protein-coding genes, we measured the strength of\nselection on up-regulating and down-regulating mutations, in specific branches\nas well as entire phylogenies. We discovered distinct modes of selection acting\non different enhancers: while all three have experienced negative selection\nagainst down-regulating mutations, the selection pressures on up-regulating\nmutations vary. In one case we detected positive selection for up-regulation,\nwhile the other two had no detectable selection on up-regulating mutations.

Across all model\norganisms the causal mutations have been discovered for only a handful of gene\nexpression adaptations, and even for these, mechanistic details (e.g. the\ntrans-regulatory factors involved) have not been determined. We previously\nreported a polygenic gene expression adaptation involving down-regulation of\nthe ergosterol biosynthesis pathway in the budding yeast Saccharomyces\ncerevisiae.

This down-regulation increases resistance to a widely used\nantifungal drug targeting ergosterol, similar to mutations disrupting this\npathway in clinical yeast isolates. The identification of the causal genetic\nvariant revealed that the selection likely occurred after the deletion was\nalready present at high frequency in the population, rather than when it was a\nnew mutation.

This is independent of the mechanism responsible for SUSY breaking.\nAny model will have one Lightest SUSY Particle (LSP), and one Next to Lightest\nSUSY Particle (NLSP). In models with conserved R-parity, the NLSP must decay\nsolely to the LSP and the SM partner of the NLSP. Therefore, studying NLSP\nproduction and decay can be regarded as a \"simplified model without\nsimplification\": Any SUSY model will have such a process.\n  The NLSP could be any sparticle: a slepton, an electroweak-ino, or even a\nsquark.

This way, the entire\nspace of models that have a kinematicall y reachable NLSP can be covered.

As a result, we\nfound 1547 superflares on 279 G-type dwarfs, which are much more than previous\n365 superflares on 148 stars. Using these new data, we studied the statistical\nproperties of occurrence frequency of superflares, and basically confirmed the\nprevious results, i.e., the occurrence frequency (dN/dE) of superflares vs\nflare energy (E) shows power-law distribution with dN/dE \\propto E^{-\\alpha},\nwhere \\alpha ~ 2.

[Theor. Chem. Acc. 114, 305 (2005)] is explored in the context\nof multi-configuration range-separated density-functional theory. The new\ndecomposition of the short-range exchange-correlation energy relies on the\nauxiliary long-range interacting wavefunction rather than the Kohn-Sham (KS)\ndeterminant. The advantage, relative to the traditional KS decomposition, is\nthat the wavefunction part of the energy is now computed with the regular\n(fully-interacting) Hamiltonian. One potential drawback is that, because of\ndouble counting, the wavefunction used to compute the energy cannot be obtained\nby minimizing the energy expression with respect to the wavefunction\nparameters. The problem is overcome by using short-range optimized effective\npotentials (OEPs). The resulting combination of OEP techniques with\nwavefunction theory has been investigated in this work, at the Hartree-Fock\n(HF) and multi-configuration self-consistent-field (MCSCF) levels. In the HF\ncase, an analytical expression for the energy gradient has been derived and\nimplemented. Calculations have been performed within the short-range local\ndensity approximation on H2, N2, Li2 and H2O. Significant improvements in\nbinding energies are obtained with the new decomposition of the short-range\nenergy. The importance of optimizing the short-range OEP at the MCSCF level\nwhen static correlation becomes significant has also been demonstrated for H2,\nusing a finite-difference gradient. The implementation of the analytical\ngradient for MCSCF wavefunctions is currently in progress.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Aug 2013 06:11:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Sep 2013 10:19:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-04"}

The purpose is to generate arbitrary\nquantum gates corresponding to Xg. This is achieved by the tracking of\nT-periodic reference trajectories that pass by Xg using the framework of\nCoron's Return Method. The T-periodic reference trajectories are generated by\napplying open-loop controls that are a sum of a finite number M of odd\nT-periodic function whose amplitudes are parameterized by a vector.

It is also shown that X(jT) exponentially converges\ntowards Xg almost surely.

In most cases a second period close to the rotation\nperiod was detected, which we interpreted as surface differential rotation\n(DR). Active stars were selected from the whole sample using the range of the\nvariability amplitude. To detect different periods in the light curves we used\nthe Lomb-Scargle periodogram in a pre-whitening approach to achieve parameters\nfor a global sine fit. The most dominant periods from the fit were ascribed to\ndifferent surface rotation periods, but spot evolution could also play a role.\nDue to the large number of stars the period errors were estimated in a\nstatistical way. We thus cannot exclude the existence of false positives among\nour periods. In our sample of 40.661 active stars we found 24.124 rotation\nperiods $P_1$ between 0.5-45 days. The distribution of stars with 0.5 < B-V <\n1.0 and ages derived from angular momentum evolution that are younger than 300\nMyr is consistent with a constant star-formation rate. A second period $P_2$\nwithin $\\pm30$% of the rotation period $P_1$ was found in 18.619 stars (77.2%).\nAttributing these two periods to DR we found that the relative shear\n$\\alpha=\\Delta\\Omega/\\Omega$ increases with rotation period, and slightly\ndecreases with effective temperature. The absolute shear $\\Delta\\Omega$\nslightly increases between $T_{eff}=3500-6000$ K. Above 6000 K $\\Delta\\Omega$\nshows much larger scatter.

Here we study\ncomplementarity in the context of an information processing task: we link the\ncomplementarity of two observables to their usefulness for superdense coding\n(SDC). In SDC, Alice sends two classical dits of information to Bob by sending\na single qudit. However, we show that encoding with commuting unitaries\nprevents Alice from sending more than one dit per qudit, implying that\ncomplementarity is necessary for SDC to be advantagous over a classical\nstrategy for information transmission. When Alice encodes with products of\nPauli operators for the $X$ and $Z$ bases, we quantify the complementarity of\nthese encodings in terms of the overlap of the $X$ and $Z$ basis elements. Our\nmain result explicitly solves for the SDC capacity as a function of the\ncomplementarity, showing that the entropy of the overlap matrix gives the\ncapacity, when the preshared state is maximally entangled. We generalise this\nequation to resources with symmetric noise such as a preshared Werner state. In\nthe most general case of arbitrary noisy resources, we obtain an analogous\nlower bound on the SDC capacity.

Such self-organized polarity is induced by spontaneous symmetry breaking\nin the intracellular activities, which produces an emergent memory effect\nassociated with slow-changing mode. Therefore, spontaneously established\npolarity should play a pivotal role in efficient chemotaxis. In this study, we\ndevelop a model of chemotactic cell migration that demonstrates the connection\nbetween intracellular polarity and chemotactic accuracy. Spontaneous polarity\nformation and gradient sensing are described by a stochastic differential\nequation. We demonstrate that the direction of polarity persists over a\ncharacteristic time that is predicted to depend on the chemoattractant\nconcentration. Next, we theoretically derive the chemotactic accuracy as a\nfunction of both the gradient sensing ability and the characteristic time of\npolarity direction. The results indicate that the accuracy can be improved by\nthe polarity. Furthermore, the analysis of chemotactic accuracy suggests that\naccuracy is maximized at some optimal responsiveness to extracellular\nperturbations. To obtain the model parameters, we studied the correlation time\nof random cell migration in cell tracking analysis of Dictyostelium cells. As\npredicted, the persistence time depended on the chemoattractant concentration.\nFrom the fitted parameters, we inferred that polarized Dictyosteium cells can\nrespond optimally to a chemical gradient.

We report\ndensity functional theory calculations of the atomic, electronic and\nthermoelectric properties of strained bulk and thin film Bi2Se3 and Bi2Te3,\nfocusing on an appropriate description of van der Waals interactions. The\ncalculations show that the van der Waals Density functional with Cooper's\nexchange can reproduce closely the experimental interlayer distances in\nunstrained Bi2Se3 and Bi2Te3. Interestingly, we predict atomic structures that\nare in much better agreement with the experimentally determined structure from\nNakajima than that obtained from Wyckoff, especially for Bi2Se3 where the\ndifference in atomic structures qualitatively changes the electronic band\nstructure. The band structure obtained using the Nakajima structure, and the\ntheoretically optimized structure, are in much better agreement with previous\nreports of photoemission measurements, than that obtained using the Wyckoff\nstructure. Fully optimizing atomic structures of bulk and thin film Bi2Se3 and\nBi2Te3 under different in-plane and uniaxial strains, we predict that the\nelectronic band gap of both the bulk materials and thin films decreases with\ntensile in-plane strain and increases with compressive in-plane strain.

Further, the in-plane power factor of n-doped Bi2Se3 can be increased\nwith compressive uniaxial strain, while that of n-doped Bi2Te3 can be increased\nby compressive in-plane strain. ...\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Aug 2013 09:56:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-08"}

The most fundamental\ntopological excitations are non-Abelian vortices, which are 1/3 quantized\nsuperfluid vortices and color magnetic flux tubes. They are created at a phase\ntransition or a rotation such compact stars. The intervortex-interaction is\nrepulsive and consequently a vortex lattice is formed. Bosonic and fermionic\nzero-energy modes are trapped in the vortex core and propagate along it as\ngapless excitations. The former consists of translational zero modes (a Kelvin\nmode) with a quadratic dispersion and CP(2) Nambu-Goldstone gapless modes with\na linear dispersion, while the latter is the triplet Majorana fermion zero\nmodes. The low-energy effective theory of the bosonic zero modes is a\nnon-relativistic free complex scalar field and a CP(2) model in 1+1 dimensions.\nThe effects of strange quark mass, electromagnetic interactions and\nnon-perturbative quantum corrections are taken into account. Colorful boojums\nat the CFL interface, quantum color magnetic monopole confined by vortices,\nwhich supports the notion of quark-hadron duality, and Yang-Mills instantons\ninside a vortex as lumps are discussed.

First, we explore the effects of several physical\nprocesses which influence the formation and evolution of abundance gradients.\nThey are: i) the inside-out formation of the disk, ii) a threshold in the gas\ndensity for star formation, iii) a variable star formation efficiency along the\ndisk, iv) radial flows and their speed, and v) different total surface mass\ndensity (gas plus stars) distributions for the halo. We are able to reproduce\nat best the present day gradients of oxygen and iron if we assume an inside-out\nformation, no threshold gas density, a constant efficiency of star formation\nalong the disk and radial gas flows. It is particularly important the choice of\nthe velocity pattern for radial flows and the combination of this velocity\npattern with the surface mass density distribution in the halo. Having selected\nthe best model, we then explore the evolution of abundance gradients in time\nand find that the gradients in general steepen in time and that at redshift z~3\nthere is a gradient inversion in the inner regions of the disk, in the sense\nthat at early epochs the oxygen abundance decreases toward the Galactic center.\nThis effect, which has been observed, is naturally produced by our models if an\ninside-out formation of the disk and and a constant star formation efficiency\nare assumed. The inversion is due to the fact that in the inside-out formation\na strong infall of primordial gas, contrasting chemical enrichment, is present\nin the innermost disk regions at early times. The gradient inversion remains\nalso in the presence of radial flows, either with constant or variable speed in\ntime, and this is a new result.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Aug 2013 12:30:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-02"}

Also it is necessary\nthat $Cp \\leq 1 - \\epsilon$ for known $\\epsilon > 0$. Previous methods for this\nproblem required extensive modification of the algorithm for every value of $C$\nand $\\epsilon$. These methods did not have explicit bounds on $\\text{E}[T]$ as\na function of $C$ and $\\epsilon$. This paper presents the first Bernoulli\nfactory for $f(p) = Cp$ with bounds on $\\text{E}[T]$ as a function of the input\nparameters. In fact, $\\sup_{p \\in [0,(1-\\epsilon)/C]} \\text{E}[T] \\leq\n9.5C\\epsilon^{-1}.$ In addition, this method is very simple to implement.\nFurthermore, a lower bound on the average running time of any $Cp$ Bernoulli\nfactory is shown. For $\\epsilon \\leq 1/2$, $\\sup_{p \\in [0,(1 - \\epsilon)/C]}\n\\text{E}[T] \\geq 0.004 C \\epsilon^{-1}$, so the new method is optimal up to a\nconstant in the running time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Aug 2013 13:16:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 Jul 2014 21:22:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-08"}

The resulting clone has an enhanced growth rate, which generates a local\nensemble of faster growing cells, thereby distorting the spherical shape of the\ntumor.

The total number of original cancer cells converges to a\nconstant as time goes to infinity, because this clone becomes enveloped by\nmutants.

The microstructure of the films are characterized by electron\nmicroscopy and their carrier-concentration are measured by Hall effect.\nField-effect experiments reveal a memory-dip that has a width compatible with\nthe carrier-concentration of the system as compared with previously studied\nelectron-glasses. It is observed that the common ingredient in all the systems\nthat exhibit electron-glass effects is high carrier-concentration suggesting\nthat their localized sites may be multi-occupied even when deep into the\ninsulating regime. That lightly-doped semiconductors do not show intrinsic\nelectron-glass effects is consistent with this empirical observation.

Naturally, the study of real-world systems leads to highly complex\nnetworks and a current challenge is to extract intelligible, simplified\ndescriptions from the network in terms of relevant subgraphs, which can provide\ninsight into the structure and function of the overall system.\n  Sparked by seminal work by Newman and Girvan, an interesting line of research\nhas been devoted to investigating modular community structure in networks,\nrevitalising the classic problem of graph partitioning.\n  However, modular or community structure in networks has notoriously evaded\nrigorous definition. The most accepted notion of community is perhaps that of a\ngroup of elements which exhibit a stronger level of interaction within\nthemselves than with the elements outside the community. This concept has\nresulted in a plethora of computational methods and heuristics for community\ndetection. Nevertheless a firm theoretical understanding of most of these\nmethods, in terms of how they operate and what they are supposed to detect, is\nstill lacking to date.\n  Here, we will develop a dynamical perspective towards community detection\nenabling us to define a measure named the stability of a graph partition. It\nwill be shown that a number of previously ad-hoc defined heuristics for\ncommunity detection can be seen as particular cases of our method providing us\nwith a dynamic reinterpretation of those measures. Our dynamics-based approach\nthus serves as a unifying framework to gain a deeper understanding of different\naspects and problems associated with community detection and allows us to\npropose new dynamically-inspired criteria for community structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Aug 2013 15:32:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-08"}
