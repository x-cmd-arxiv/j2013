Depending on these two\ncontrolling parameters, various flow patterns are indeed realized. We classify\nthem into three basic patterns and two intermediate ones; the former includes\nsloshing motion (SL), spiral motion (SP) and multiple buoyant bubble formation\n(BB); the latter consists of spiral motion with buoyant-bubble formation (SPB)\nand spiral motion with pulsationally changing rotational velocities (SPP).\nAlthough the post-shock flow is highly chaotic, there is a clear trend in the\npattern realization. The sloshing and spiral motions tend to be dominant for\nhigh accretion rates and low neutrino luminosities, and multiple buoyant\nbubbles prevail for low accretion rates and high neutrino luminosities. It is\ninteresting that the dominant pattern is not always identical between the\nsemi-nonlinear and nonlinear phases near the critical luminosity; the\nintermediate cases are realized in the latter case.

They form in dense cores of molecular clouds that are observed to be\nsignificantly magnetized. Our previous study shows that magnetic braking can\ntighten the binary separation during the protostellar mass accretion phase by\nremoving the angular momentum of the accreting material. Recent numerical\ncalculations of single star formation have shown that misalignment between the\nmagnetic field and rotation axis may weaken both magnetic braking and the\nassociated magnetically driven outflows. These two effects allow for disk\nformation even in strongly magnetized cores. Here we investigate the effects of\nmagnetic field misalignment on the properties of protobinaries. Somewhat\nsurprisingly, the misaligned magnetic field is more efficient at tightening the\nbinary orbit compared to the aligned field. The main reason is that the\nmisalignment weakens the magnetically-driven outflow, which allows more\nmaterial to accrete onto the binary. Even though the specific angular momentum\nof this inner material is higher than in the aligned case, it is insufficient\nto compensate for the additional mass. A corollary of this result is that a\nweaker field is required to achieve the same degree of inward migration when\nthe field is tilted relative to the rotation axis. Large field misalignment\nalso helps to produce rotationally-supported circumbinary disks even for\nrelatively strong magnetic fields, by weakening the magnetically-dominated\nstructure close to the binary. Our result may provide an explanation for the\ncircumbinary disks detected in recent SMA and ALMA observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Aug 2013 18:20:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-06"}

For the low probe-photon\nenergy case, the negative differential transmission is found to come from the\nincrease of the intra-band conductivity due to the large variation of electron\ndistribution after the pumping.

The first is based on the principle that two spectral lines\nare just resolved when the mutual disturbance in fitting the fluxes of the\nlines reaches a threshold (here equal to that of sinc^2 profiles at the\nRayleigh criterion). The second criterion assumes that two spectrographs have\nequal resolving powers if the wavelength error in fitting a narrow spectral\nline is the same in each case (given equal signal flux and noise power). The\ntwo criteria give similar results, and give rise to scaling factors which can\nbe applied to bring resolving power calculated using the FWHM on to a\nconsistent scale.

The projected\ncircle has a larger FWHM in comparison with its true resolution, so using FWHM\nto characterise the resolution of a spectrograph which is fed by multi-mode\nfibres significantly underestimates its true resolving power if it has small\naberrations and a well-sampled profile.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Aug 2013 02:17:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

The ejecta emission (the \"merger-nova\") powered by the magnetar peaks\nin the UV band and the peak of lightcurve progressively shifts to an earlier\nepoch with increasing frequency. A magnetar-powered mergernova could have an\noptical peak brightness comparable to a supernova, which is a few tens or\nhundreds times brighter than the radioactive-powered merger-novae (the\nso-called macro-nova or kilo-nova). On the other hand, such a merger-nova would\npeak earlier and have a significantly shorter duration than that of a\nsupernova. An early collapse of the magnetar could suppress the brightness of\nthe optical emission and shorten its duration.

These oscillators, which are called neuronal\noscillator, share some common response structures with other biological\noscillations. In this study, we analyze the dependence of the global dynamics\nof an impulse-driven stochastic neuronal oscillator on the relaxation rate to\nthe limit cycle, the strength of the intrinsic noise, and the impulsive input\nparameters. To do this, we use a Markov operator that both reflects the density\nevolution of the oscillator and is an extension of the phase transition curve,\nwhich describes the phase shift due to a single isolated impulse. Previously,\nwe derived the Markov operator for the finite relaxation rate that describes\nthe dynamics of the entire phase plane. Here, we construct a Markov operator\nfor the infinite relaxation rate that describes the stochastic dynamics\nrestricted to the limit cycle. In both cases, the response of the stochastic\nneuronal oscillator to time-varying impulses is described by a product of\nMarkov operators. Furthermore, we calculate the number of spikes between two\nconsecutive impulses to relate the dynamics of the oscillator to the number of\nspikes per unit time and the interspike interval density. Specifically, we\nanalyze the dynamics of the number of spikes per unit time based on the\nproperties of the Markov operators. Each Markov operator can be decomposed into\nstationary and transient components based on the properties of the eigenvalues\nand eigenfunctions. This allows us to evaluate the difference in the number of\nspikes per unit time between the stationary and transient responses of the\noscillator, which we show to be based on the dependence of the oscillator on\npast activity. Our analysis shows how the duration of the past neuronal\nactivity depends on the relaxation rate, the noise strength and the input\nparameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Aug 2013 03:42:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

Taking into account the non conservative\nevolution of the system due to mass loss from an accretion disk as a result of\npropeller action and from the companion via ablation by the pulsar, the\ntransition from the accretion powered to rotation powered phase is\ninvestigated. It is shown that the operation of the propeller and ablation\nmechanisms can be responsible for the formation and evolution of black widow\nmillisecond pulsar systems from the low mass X-ray binary phase at an orbital\nperiod of ~0.1 day. For a range of population synthesis input parameters, the\nresults reveal that a population of black widow millisecond pulsars\ncharacterized by orbital periods as long as ~0.4 days and companion masses as\nlow as ~0.005 Msun can be produced. The orbital periods and minimum companion\nmass of this radio millisecond pulsar population critically depend on the\nthermal bloating of the semi-degenerate hydrogen mass losing component, with\nlonger orbital periods for a greater degree of bloating. Provided that the\nradius of the companion is increased by about a factor of 2 relative to a fully\ndegenerate, zero temperature configuration, an approximate agreement between\nobserved long orbital periods and theoretical modeling of hydrogen rich donors\ncan be achieved.

Here the condensation of fermionic pairs is\nanalyzed as a function of the s-wave scattering length, which can be tuned in\nexperiments by using the technique of Feshbach resonances from a small and\nnegative value (corresponding to the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) regime of\nCooper Fermi pairs) to a small and positive value (corresponding to the regime\nof the Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) of molecular dimers), crossing the\nunitarity regime where the scattering length diverges.

The goals of this work are to present new Ks- and Lp-band\npolarimetry on an unprecedented number of sources in the central parsec of the\nGC, thereby expanding our previous results in the H- and Ks-bands. We use\nAO-assisted Ks- and Lp-band observations, obtained at the ESO VLT. High\nprecision photometry and the new polarimetric calibration method for NACO allow\nus to map the polarization in a region of 8\" x 25\" (Ks) resp. 26\" x 28\" (Lp).\nThese are the first polarimetric observations of the GC in the Lp-band in 30\nyears, with vastly improved spatial resolution compared to previous results.\nThis allows resolved polarimetry on bright bow-shock sources in this area for\nthe first time at this wavelength. We find foreground polarization to be\nlargely parallel to the Galactic plane (Ks-band: 6.1% at 20 degrees, Lp-band:\n4.5% at 20 degrees, in good agreement with our previous findings and with older\nresults. The previously described Lp-band excess in the foregound polarization\ntowards the GC could be confirmed here for a much larger number of sources. The\nbow-shock sources contained in the FOV seem to show a different relation\nbetween the polarization in the observed wavelength bands than what was\ndetermined for the foreground. This points to the different relevant\npolarization mechanisms. The resolved polarization patterns of IRS 5 and 10W\nmatch the findings we presented earlier for IRS~1W. Additionally, intrinsic\nLp-band polarization was measured for IRS 1W and 21, as well as for other, less\nprominent MIR-excess sources (IRS 2S, 2L, 5NE). The new data offer support for\nthe presumed bow-shock nature of several of these sources (1W, 5, 5NE, 10W, 21)\nand for the model of bow-shock polarization presented in our last work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Aug 2013 12:39:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

The latter gives inside into the geometry of the\nemitting region as well as on the structure of the magnetic field. Based on an\nexact analytical solution of the striped wind with finite current sheet\nthickness, we analyze in detail the phase-resolved polarization variability\nemanating from the synchrotron radiation. We assume that the main contribution\nto the wind emissivity comes from a thin transition layer where the dominant\ntoroidal magnetic field reverses its polarity, the so-called current sheet. The\nresulting radiation is mostly linearly polarized. In the off-pulse region, the\nelectric vector lies in the direction of the projection onto the plane of the\nsky of the rotation axis of the pulsar. This property is unique to the wind\nmodel and in good agreement with the Crab data. Other properties such as a\nreduced degree of polarization and a characteristic sweep of the polarization\nangle within the pulses are also reproduced. These properties are qualitatively\nunaffected by variations of the wind Lorentz factor, the lepton injection power\nlaw index, the contrast in hot and cold particle, the obliquity of the pulsar\nand the inclination of the line of sight.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Aug 2013 13:20:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

A\ndistinct, but intrinsically correlated phenomenon occurring on a longer\ntimescale is the magnetization precession after the ultrafast demagnetization\nprocess, if a magnetic field is applied to tilt the magnetization vector away\nfrom its easy direction, which can be attributed to the change of anisotropy\nafter laser heating. In an in-plane magnetized Pt/Co/Pt thin film with\nperpendicular interface anisotropy, we found excellent agreement between\ntheoretical prediction with plausible parameters and experimental data measured\nusing time resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect. This agreement confirms that\nthe time evolution of the anisotropy field, which is driven by the interaction\nbetween electrons and phonons, determines the magnetization precession\ncompletely.

We also observed the cluster with XMM-Newton and Chandra to derive the\nproperties of the ICM. The radio emission of the N-E nucleus of the dumb-bell\nBCG shows an active radio galaxy, plus aged diffuse emission, which is not\nrefurbished at present. Our Chandra data show that the radio active nucleus of\nthe BCG has extended X-ray emission, which we classify as a low-luminosity\ncorona. A residual image of the XMM-Newton brightness shows the presence of a\nspiral-like feature, which we interpret as the signature of gas sloshing. The\npresence of a subgroup is clear in the surface brightness residual map, and in\nthe XMM-Newton temperature analysis. The optical 2D analysis shows substructure\nin A3560. A galaxy clump was found at the location of the X-ray subgroup, and\nanother group is present south of the cluster core, close to the spiral-like\nfeature.

On the other hand, the bent jets and lobes of the current\nradio AGN activity may reflect a complex gas velocity field in the innermost\ncluster regions and/or sloshing-induced oscillations in the motion of the cD\ngalaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Aug 2013 14:30:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

It is\ncharacterized by metric discontinuities and vanishing deficit angles. Area\nRegge calculus arises in the large-spin limit of the Barrett-Crane spinfoam\nmodel, but not in the newer EPRL/FK model. We address the viability of area\nRegge calculus as a discretization of General Relativity. We argue that when\nall triangles are spacelike and all tetrahedra have the same signature,\nnon-trivial solutions of the area calculus are associated with a nonzero Ricci\nscalar. Our argument rests on a seemingly natural regularization of the metric\ndiscontinuities. It rules out the Euclidean area calculus, as well as the\nLorentzian sector with all tetrahedra spacelike - the two setups usually\nconsidered in spinfoam models. On the other hand, we argue that the area\ncalculus has attractive properties from the point of view of finite-region\nobservables in quantum gravity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Aug 2013 15:33:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-06"}
