In the linear theory\nthe critical Reynolds number for axisymmetric perturbations is not influenced\nby the current-induced axisymmetric magnetic field but all axisymmetric\nmagnetic perturbations decay. The nonaxisymmetric perturbations with m=1 are\nexcited even without rotation for large enough Hartmann numbers (\"Tayler\ninstability\"). For slow rotation their growth rates scale with the Alfv\\'en\nfrequency of the magnetic field but for fast rotation they scale with the\nrotation rate of the inner cylinder. In the nonlinear regime the ratio of the\nenergy of the magnetic m=1 modes and the toroidal background field is very low\nfor the non-rotating Tayler instability but it strongly grows if differential\nrotation is present. For super-Alfv\\'enic rotation the energies in the m=1\nmodes of flow and field do not depend on the molecular viscosity, they are\nalmost in equipartition and contain only 1.5% of the centrifugal energy of the\ninner cylinder.

While the individual data streams are\nusually trivial to process, their aggregated data volumes easily exceed the\nscalability of traditional stream processing systems. At the same time,\nmassively-parallel data processing systems like MapReduce or Dryad currently\nenjoy a tremendous popularity for data-intensive applications and have proven\nto scale to large numbers of nodes. Many of these systems also provide\nstreaming capabilities. However, unlike traditional stream processors, these\nsystems have disregarded QoS requirements of prospective stream processing\napplications so far. In this paper we address this gap. First, we analyze\ncommon design principles of today's parallel data processing frameworks and\nidentify those principles that provide degrees of freedom in trading off the\nQoS goals latency and throughput. Second, we propose a highly distributed\nscheme which allows these frameworks to detect violations of user-defined QoS\nconstraints and optimize the job execution without manual interaction. As a\nproof of concept, we implemented our approach for our massively-parallel data\nprocessing framework Nephele and evaluated its effectiveness through a\ncomparison with Hadoop Online. For an example streaming application from the\nmultimedia domain running on a cluster of 200 nodes, our approach improves the\nprocessing latency by a factor of at least 13 while preserving high data\nthroughput when needed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Aug 2013 16:15:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-06"}

In\nthe simulation, the continuous time dynamic system is converted into a\ndiscrete-time recursive system. As a result of this, the state indeed evolves\nby Markov transitions in the simulation rather than in continuous time. One\nsignificant issue involved with modeling of the system from practice to\nsimulation is that the simulation parameter, particularly e.g. the state Markov\ntransition noise, needs to match the iteration period of the filter. Otherwise,\nthe simulation performance may be far from the truth. Unfortunately, quite\ncommonly different-speed filters are evaluated and compared under the same\nsimulation model with the same state transition noise for simplicity regardless\nof their real sampling periods. Here the note primarily aims at clarifying this\nproblem and point out that it is very necessary to use a proper simulation\nnoise that matches the filter's speed for evaluation and comparison under the\nsame simulation model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Aug 2013 18:23:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-06"}

Perturbations are decomposed\ninto shearing waves whose evolution is followed via numerical integration of\nthe linearized ideal MHD equations. There are two basic modes in the system --\ninertia-gravity waves and magnetic mode, which displays the magnetorotational\ninstability (MRI). As distinct from previous studies, we introduce\n`eigenvariables' characterizing each (counter-propagating) component of the\ninertia-gravity and magnetic modes, which are governed by a set of four first\norder coupled ordinary differential equations. This allowed us to identify a\nnew process of linear coupling of the two above non-axisymmetric modes due to\nthe disc's differential rotation. We did a comparative analysis of the dynamics\nof non-axisymmetric and axisymmetric magnetic mode perturbations. It is shown\nthat the growth of optimal and close-to-optimal non-axisymmetric harmonics of\nthis mode, having transient nature, can prevail over the exponential growth of\naxisymmetric ones (i.e., over the axisymmetric MRI) during dynamical time. A\npossible implication of this result for axisymmetric channel solutions is\ndiscussed. Specifically, the formation of the channel may be affected/impeded\nby non-axisymmetric modes already at the early linear stage leading to its\nuntimely disruption -- the outcome strongly depends on the amplitude and\nspectrum of initial perturbation. So, this competition may result in an\nuncertainty in the magnetic mode's non-linear dynamics. It is also shown that a\nmaximum non-axisymmetric growth is at vertical wavelengths close to the\nscale-height for which compressibility effects are important. This indirectly\nsuggests that compressibility plays a role in the dynamics of the\nnon-axisymmetric MRI.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Aug 2013 18:33:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

They arise as a\nrelativistic analog of the wave functions of quantum mechanics but can be\napplied also in quantum field theory. The evolution of a wave function with N\ntime variables is governed by N Schr\\\"odinger equations, one for each time\nvariable. These Schr\\\"odinger equations can be inconsistent with each other,\ni.e., they can fail to possess a joint solution for every initial condition; in\nfact, the N Hamiltonians need to satisfy a certain commutator condition in\norder to be consistent. While this condition is automatically satisfied for\nnon-interacting particles, it is a challenge to set up consistent multi-time\nequations with interaction. We prove for a wide class of multi-time\nSchr\\\"odinger equations that the presence of interaction potentials (given by\nmultiplication operators) leads to inconsistency. We conclude that interaction\nhas to be implemented instead by creation and annihilation of particles, which,\nin fact, can be done consistently, as we show elsewhere [17]. We also prove the\nfollowing result: When a cut-off length $\\delta>0$ is introduced (in the sense\nthat the multi-time wave function is defined only on a certain set of spacelike\nconfigurations, thereby breaking Lorentz invariance), then the multi-time\nSchr\\\"odinger equations with interaction potentials of range $\\delta$ are\nconsistent; however, in the desired limit $\\delta\\to 0$ of removing the\ncut-off, the resulting multi-time equations are interaction-free, which\nsupports the conclusion expressed in the title.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Aug 2013 18:43:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 24 Jan 2014 16:18:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-28"}

Cancer drugs ideally kill cancer cells\nwhile limiting harm to healthy cells. However, the inherent variance among\ncells in both cancer and healthy cell populations increases the difficulty of\nselective drug action. Here we propose a classification framework based on the\nidea that an ideal cancer drug should maximally discriminate between cancer and\nhealthy cells. We first explore how molecular markers can be used to\ndiscriminate cancer cells from healthy cells on a single cell basis, and then\nhow the effects of drugs are statistically predicted by these molecular\nmarkers. We then combine these two ideas to show how to optimally match drugs\nto tumor cells. We find that expression levels of a handful of genes suffice to\ndiscriminate well between individual cells in cancer and healthy tissue. We\nalso find that gene expression predicts the efficacy of cancer drugs,\nsuggesting that the cancer drugs act as classifiers using gene profiles. In\nagreement with our first finding, a small number of genes predict drug efficacy\nwell. Finally, we formulate a framework that defines an optimal drug, and\npredicts drug cocktails that may target cancer more accurately than the\nindividual drugs alone. Conceptualizing cancer drugs as solving a\ndiscrimination problem in the high-dimensional space of molecular markers\npromises to inform the design of new cancer drugs and drug cocktails.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Aug 2013 19:44:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-07"}

Based on similarities between the full\nSED shapes (0.3-8 micron), we have divided galaxies in 32 different spectral\nclasses and stacked their photometry. As each class contains galaxies over a\nrange in redshift, the resulting rest-frame SEDs are well-sampled in wavelength\nand show various spectral features including Halpha and the UV dust bump at\n2175 Angstrom.

The Milky Way and Calzetti law provide poor fits at UV\nwavelengths for nearly all SEDs. Consistent with previous studies, we find that\nthe best-fit attenuation law varies with spectral type.

Moreover, the attenuation curve correlates with\nspecific star formation rate (SFR), with more active galaxies having shallower\ndust curves and weaker bumps.

To encourage such\ncuriosity, we solicit questions submitted real-time via InkSurvey and\npen-enabled mobile devices (Tablet PCs) in response to interactive simulations\n(applets) run either before or in class. This provides students with practice\nin asking questions, increases metacognition, and serves as a rich springboard\nfrom which to introduce content and/or address misconceptions.\n  We describe the procedure for measuring curiosity and results from applying\nthis method in a junior level electromagnetics engineering physics course. We\nconclude that students are indeed more curious than they appear in class, and\nstudents participate even without extrinsic motivation. This method of\nenhancing curiosity using interactive simulations coupled with real-time\nformative assessment in response to open-format questions could be implemented\nin a wide variety of science and engineering courses as well as elsewhere.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Aug 2013 20:14:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-07"}

We study the \"time\"\ncorrelator of local gauge invariant operators integrated over the remaining\nthree dimensions. The energy gaps are measured in the isospin I=0,1 and\ninternal spin J=0,1 channels. No correlation is found in the I=1,J=0 channel.\nIn the I=1, J=1 channel and far from the critical mass value $m_c$ the energy\ngap roughly follows the bare value $m$ (vector mesons). In approaching the\ncritical value $m_c$ at $\\beta$ fixed, there is a bifurcation of the energy\ngap: one branch follows the value $m$, while the new is much larger and it\nshows a more and more dominant weight. This phenomenon might be the sign of two\nimportant features: the long range correlation near the fixed point at $\\beta\n\\to \\infty$ implied by the low energy gap and the screening (or confining)\nmechanisms across the $m=m_c$ associated to the larger gap. The I=0, J=0,1 gaps\nare of the same order of magnitude, typically larger than the I=1, J=1 gap (for\n$m>>m_c$). For $m\\sim m_c$ both I=0 gaps have a dramatic drop with minima near\nthe value $m$. This behavior might correspond to the formation of I=0 bound\nstates both in the J=0 and J=1 channels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Aug 2013 20:33:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

Frequency-dependent time lags between\nsimultaneously emitted pulses of light can signal a modification in the photon\ndispersion relation; however, matter engenders the cosmos with a dispersive\nindex of refraction to similar effect. We construct a theoretical framework for\nthe analysis of such effects, contrasting these dispersive terms with those\nfrom LIV models. We consider all matter, both luminous and dark. Though the\nonly known mode of interaction for dark matter (DM) is gravitational, most\nmodels of dark matter also allow for electromagnetic interactions, if only at\nthe one-loop level in perturbation theory. Generically, the leading order\ndispersive effects due to matter scale with photon energy as \\omega^{-2} for a\ncharged DM candidate and \\omega^2 for a neutral DM candidate. Terms linear in\n\\omega can arise in the index of refraction if parity and charge-parity\nasymmetries are present at the Lagrangian or system level. Herein, we compute\nthe index of refraction for a millicharged dark matter candidate at the\none-loop level, a neutral scalar DM candidate introduced by Boehm and Fayet,\nand the MSSM's neutralino. For a neutral DM candidate, we determine that matter\neffects can compete with LIV effects that depend quadratically on energy\nwhenever the photon energy is beyond 10^{29} GeV, well beyond the GZK cutoff.\nThe dispersive matter effects that scale linearly with \\omega are model\ndependent, and their existence results in circular birefringence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Aug 2013 20:37:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 6 Sep 2013 02:38:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-18"}

These ambiguities are associated to choices of an integration\ncontour in the resummation of perturbation theory, along (singular) Stokes\ndirections in the complex Borel plane (rendering perturbative expansions\nnon-Borel summable along any Stokes line). More recently, it has been shown\nthat the proper framework to address these issues is that of resurgent analysis\nand transseries. In this context, the cancelation of all nonperturbative\nambiguities is shown to be a consequence of choosing the transseries median\nresummation as the appropriate family of unambiguous real solutions along the\ncoupling-constant real axis. While the median resummation is easily implemented\nfor one-parameter transseries, once one considers more general multi-parameter\ntransseries the procedure becomes highly dependent upon properly understanding\nStokes transitions in the complex Borel plane. In particular, all Stokes\ncoefficients must now be known in order to explicitly implement multi-parameter\nmedian resummations. In the cases where quantum-theoretical physical\nobservables are described by resurgent functions and transseries, the methods\ndescribed herein show how one may cancel nonperturbative ambiguities, and\ndefine these observables nonperturbatively starting out from perturbation\ntheory. Along the way, structural results concerning resurgent transseries are\nalso obtained.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Aug 2013 20:51:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Jan 2014 11:24:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

Offline ephemeral\nsocial networks (OffESNs) are the networks created ad-hoc at a specific\nlocation for a specific purpose and lasting for short period of time, relying\non mobile social media such as Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) and\nBluetooth devices. The primary purpose of people in the OffESNs is to acquire\nand share information via attending prescheduled events. Event Recommendation\nover this kind of networks can facilitate attendees on selecting the\nprescheduled events and organizers on making resource planning. However,\nbecause of lack of users preference and rating information, as well as explicit\nsocial relations, both rating based traditional recommendation methods and\nsocial-trust based recommendation methods can no longer work well to recommend\nevents in the OffESNs. To address the challenges such as how to derive users\nlatent preferences and social relations and how to fuse the latent information\nin a unified model, we first construct two heterogeneous interaction social\nnetworks, an event participation network and a physical proximity network.\nThen, we use them to derive users latent preferences and latent networks on\nsocial relations, including like-minded peers, co-attendees and friends.\nFinally, we propose an LNF (Latent Networks Fusion) model under a pairwise\nfactor graph to infer event attendance probabilities for recommendation.\nExperiments on an RFID-based real conference dataset have demonstrated the\neffectiveness of the proposed model compared with typical solutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Aug 2013 21:00:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-07"}

Seismic oscillations\nfrom the interior pass through them into the atmosphere, changing their nature\nin the process to fast and slow magneto-acoustic waves. The fast waves then\npartially reflect and partially mode convert to upgoing and downgoing Alfv\\'en\nwaves. The reflected fast and downgoing Alfv\\'en waves then re-enter the\ninterior through the active regions that spawned them, infecting the surface\nseismology with signatures of the atmosphere. Using numerical simulations of\nwaves in uniform magnetic fields, we calculate the upward acoustic and\nAlfv\\'enic losses in the atmosphere as functions of field inclination and wave\norientation as well as the Time-Distance `travel time' perturbations, and show\nthat they are related. Travel time perturbations relative to quiet Sun can\nexceed 40 seconds in 1 kG magnetic field. It is concluded that active region\nseismology is indeed significantly infected by waves leaving and re-entering\nthe interior through magnetic wounds, with differing travel times depending on\nthe orientation of the wave vector relative to the magnetic field. This\npresages a new directional-time-distance seismology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Aug 2013 04:39:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-12"}

The idea\nis to partition the pixels of a hyperspectral image into a number of spatial\nneighborhoods called contextual groups and to model each pixel with a linear\ncombination of a few dictionary elements learned from the data. Since pixels\ninside a contextual group are often made up of the same materials, their linear\ncombinations are constrained to use common elements from the dictionary. To\nthis end, dictionary learning is carried out with a joint sparse regularizer to\ninduce a common sparsity pattern in the sparse coefficients of each contextual\ngroup. The sparse coefficients are then used for classification using a linear\nSVM. Experimental results on a number of real hyperspectral images confirm the\neffectiveness of the proposed representation for hyperspectral image\nclassification. Moreover, experiments with simulated multispectral data show\nthat the proposed model is capable of finding representations that may\neffectively be used for classification of multispectral-resolution samples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Aug 2013 05:57:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-07"}

Non-Heisenberg\ninteraction at low doping levels and its effect on the Curie temperature are\nexamined. The electronic structure of a substitutional Gd and of an O vacancy\nin EuO are evaluated.

Despite having just one free parameter, the first law fits the\nmammalian cerebrum better than any existing function, both across species and\nwithin humans. According to the second law, the white matter volume scales,\nwith a few minor corrections, to the cortical surface area.

We formulate a versatile\nposterior consistency theorem that applies both to well- and mis-specified\nmodels and which we use to re-derive Schwartz's theorem, consider\nKullback-Leibler consistency and formulate consistency theorems in which priors\ncharge metric balls. It is generalized to sieved models with Barron's\nnegligible prior mass condition and to separable models with variations on\nWalker's consistency theorem. Results also apply to marginal semi-parametric\nconsistency: support boundary estimation is considered explicitly and\nconsistency is proved in a model for which Kullback-Leibler priors do not\nexist. Other examples include consistent density estimation in mixture models\nwith Dirichlet or Gibbs-type priors of full weak support.

Modelling this important\nprocess is complicated by the coupling between flow and transport equations,\nwhich are linked through the osmotic pressure induced by the colloidal plasma\nproteins. Microvessel wall is a composite media with the internal glycocalyx\nlayer exerting a remarkable sieving effect on macromolecules, with respect to\nthe external layer composed by endothelial cells. The physiological structure\nof microvessel is represented as the superimposition of two membranes with\ndifferent properties; the inner membrane represents the glycocalyx, while the\nouter membrane represents the surrounding endothelial cells. Application of\nmass conservation principle and thermodynamic considerations lead to a model\ncomposed by two coupled second-order partial differential equations in the\nhydrostatic and osmotic pressures, one expressing volumetric mass conservation\nand the other, which is non-linear, expressing macromolecules mass\nconservation. Despite system complexity, the assumption that the properties of\nthe layers are piece-wise constant allows us to obtain analytical solutions for\nthe two pressures. This solution is in agreement with experimental\nobservations, which contrary to common belief, show that flow reversal cannot\noccur in steady state unless luminal hydrostatic pressure drops below\nphysiologically plausible values. The observed variations of volumetric and\nsolute mass flux in case of a significant reduction of luminal hydrostatic\npressure are in qualitative agreement with observed variations during\nexperiments reported in the literature. On the other hand, homogenising\nmicrovessel wall into a single-layer membrane with equivalent properties leads\nto a different distribution of pressure across microvessel wall, not consistent\nwith observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Aug 2013 13:52:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 9 Aug 2013 08:44:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-12"}

Pruning the\nextinct lineages out of such trees leads to natural models for reconstructed\ntrees (i.e., phylogenies of extant species). Alternatively, reconstructed trees\ncan be modelled by coalescent point processes (CPP), where trees grow\n\"horizontally\" by the sequential addition of vertical edges. Each new edge\nstarts at some random speciation time and ends at the present time; speciation\ntimes are drawn from the same distribution independently. CPP lead to extremely\nfast computation of tree likelihoods and simulation of reconstructed trees.\nTheir topology always follows the uniform distribution on ranked tree shapes\n(URT). We characterize which forward-time models lead to URT reconstructed\ntrees and among these, which lead to CPP reconstructed trees. We show that for\nany \"asymmetric\" diversification model in which speciation rates only depend on\ntime and extinction rates only depend on time and on a non-heritable trait\n(e.g., age), the reconstructed tree is CPP, even if extant species are\nincompletely sampled. If rates additionally depend on the number of species,\nthe reconstructed tree is (only) URT (but not CPP). We characterize the common\ndistribution of speciation times in the CPP description, and discuss incomplete\nspecies sampling as well as three special model cases in detail: 1) extinction\nrate does not depend on a trait; 2) rates do not depend on time; 3) mass\nextinctions may happen additionally at certain points in the past.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Aug 2013 14:50:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-07"}

We adopt the Bayesian inference formulation: given observational data\nand their uncertainty, the governing forward problem and its uncertainty, and a\nprior probability distribution describing uncertainty in the parameter field,\nfind the posterior probability distribution over the parameter field. The prior\nmust be chosen appropriately in order to guarantee well-posedness of the\ninfinite-dimensional inverse problem and facilitate computation of the\nposterior. Furthermore, straightforward discretizations may not lead to\nconvergent approximations of the infinite-dimensional problem. And finally,\nsolution of the discretized inverse problem via explicit construction of the\ncovariance matrix is prohibitive due to the need to solve the forward problem\nas many times as there are parameters. Our computational framework builds on\nthe infinite-dimensional formulation proposed by Stuart (A. M.

The\nframework additionally incorporates algorithms for manipulating the prior,\nconstructing a low rank approximation of the data-informed component of the\nposterior covariance operator, and exploring the posterior that together ensure\nscalability of the entire framework to very high parameter dimensions.

The significant\nincrease in capital requirements renders it necessary for banks to take into\naccount the constraint of capital requirement when they make asset allocation\ndecisions. In this paper, we propose a new asset allocation model that\nincorporates the regulatory capital requirements under both the Basel 2.5\nAccord, which is currently in effect, and the Basel III Accord, which was\nrecently proposed and is currently under discussion. We propose an unified\nalgorithm based on the alternating direction augmented Lagrangian method to\nsolve the model; we also establish the first-order optimality of the limit\npoints of the sequence generated by the algorithm under some mild conditions.\nThe algorithm is simple and easy to implement; each step of the algorithm\nconsists of solving convex quadratic programming or one-dimensional\nsubproblems.
