The calculation of S depends on the\nmaximum possible degree assortativity r among graphs in G(D). The original\nmethod involves a heuristic construction of a maximally assortative graph g*.\nThe approximation by Beichl and Cloteaux involves constructing a possibly\ndisconnected graph g' with r(g') >= r(g*) and requires O(n^2) tests for the\ngraphicality of a degree sequence. The present paper uses the Tripathi-Vijay\ntest to streamline this approximation, and thereby to investigate two\ncollections of graphs: Barabasi-Albert trees and coauthorship graphs of\nmathematical sciences researchers. Long-term trends in the coauthorship graphs\nare discussed, and contextualized by insights derived from the BA trees. It is\nknown that greater degree-based preferential attachment produces greater\nvariance in degree sequences, and these trees exhibited assortativities\nrestricted to a narrow band. In contrast, variance in degree rose over time in\nthe coauthorship graphs in spite of weakening degree-based preferential\nattachment. These observations and their implications are discussed and avenues\nof future work are suggested.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Aug 2013 16:13:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-20"}

We want to determine the fundamental stellar\nand system parameters of the eclipsing binary as a precondition for\nasteroseismic modelling of the pulsating component and to establish whether the\nstar is a semi-detached Algol-type system. We measured the radial velocities of\nboth components from new high-resolution spectra using TODCOR and compute the\norbit using PHOEBE. We used the KOREL program to decompose the observed spectra\ninto its components, and analysed the decomposed spectra to determine the\natmospheric parameters. For this, we developed a new computer program for the\nnormalisation of the KOREL output spectra. Fundamental stellar parameters are\ndetermined by combining the spectroscopic results with those from the analysis\nof the Kepler light curve. We obtain Teff, logg, vsini, and the absolute masses\nand radii of the components, together with their flux ratio and separation.\nWhereas the secondary star rotates synchronously with the orbital motion, the\nprimary star rotates subsynchronously by a factor of 0.75. The newly determined\nmass ratio of 0.0911 is higher than previously thought and means a detached\nconfiguration is required to fit the light curve. With its low orbital period\nand very low mass ratio, the system shows characteristics of the R CMa-type\nstars but differs from this group by being detached. Its current state is\nassumed to be that of a detached post-Algol binary system with a pulsating\nprimary component.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Aug 2013 18:03:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-20"}

For isolating as well\nas for approximating all complex roots, the best algorithm known is based on an\nalmost optimal method for approximate polynomial factorization, introduced by\nPan in 2002. Pan's factorization algorithm goes back to the splitting circle\nmethod from Schoenhage in 1982. The main drawbacks of Pan's method are that it\nis quite involved and that all roots have to be computed at the same time. For\nthe important special case, where only the real roots have to be computed, much\nsimpler methods are used in practice; however, they considerably lag behind\nPan's method with respect to complexity.\n  In this paper, we resolve this discrepancy by introducing a hybrid of the\nDescartes method and Newton iteration, denoted ANEWDSC, which is simpler than\nPan's method, but achieves a run-time comparable to it. Our algorithm computes\nisolating intervals for the real roots of any real square-free polynomial,\ngiven by an oracle that provides arbitrary good approximations of the\npolynomial's coefficients.

Recent work has shown that\nstructural variants (insertions, deletions, inversions and transpositions) are\na major source of genetic variation, often out-numbering single nucleotide\nvariants in terms of total bases affected. Despite the near ubiquity of\nstructural variants, major questions about their interaction with natural\nselection remain. For example, how does the allele frequency spectrum of\nstructural variants differ when compared to single nucleotide variants? How\noften do structural variants affect genes, and what are the consequences? To\nbegin to address these questions, we have systematically identified and\ncharacterized a large set submicroscopic insertion and deletion (indel)\nvariants (between 1 kb to 200 kb in length) among ten individuals from a single\nnatural population of the plant species Mimulus guttatus.

However, no\nresults exist on general bounds for non-polynomial utility functions.\n  Here, we consider general versions of these games in which the utility of\neach resource is an arbitrary non-decreasing function of the congestion. In\nparticular, we consider a large family of superpolynomial utility functions\nwhich are asymptotically larger than any polynomial. We demonstrate that for\nevery such function there exist games for which the price of anarchy is\nunbounded and increasing with the number of players (even if they have\ninfinitesimal weights) while network resources remain fixed. We give tight\nlower and upper bounds which show this dependence on the number of players.\nFurthermore we provide an exact characterization of the $PoA$ of all congestion\ngames whose utility costs are bounded above by a polynomial function.\nHeretofore such results existed only for games with polynomial cost functions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Aug 2013 19:14:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-20"}

After the scrambling time, the quantum\nmechanical structure of a black hole becomes that of an eternal black hole at\nthe microscopic level. In particular, the stretched horizon degrees of freedom\nand the states entangled with them can be mapped into the near-horizon modes in\nthe two exterior regions of an eternal black hole, whose mass is taken to be\nthat of the evolving black hole at each moment. Salient features arising from\nthis picture include: (i) the number of degrees of freedom needed to describe a\nblack hole is e^{A/2 l_P^2}, where A is the area of the horizon; (ii) black\nhole states having smooth horizons span only an e^{A/4 l_P^2}-dimensional\nsubspace of the relevant e^{A/2 l_P^2}-dimensional Hilbert space; (iii)\ninternal dynamics of the horizon is such that an infalling observer finds a\nsmooth horizon with probability 1 if a state stays in this subspace.

However we\npoint out that classical induction heating contains a subtle conceptual error,\nin consequence of which the electric field inside the asteroid was calculated\nincorrectly. The problem is that the motional electric field used by Sonett et\nal. is the electric field in the freely streaming plasma far from the asteroid;\nin fact the motional field vanishes at the asteroid surface for realistic\nassumptions about the plasma density. In this paper we revisit and improve the\ninduction heating scenario by: (1) correcting the conceptual error by self\nconsistently calculating the electric field in and around the boundary layer at\nthe asteroid-plasma interface; (2) considering weakly-ionized plasmas\nconsistent with current ideas about protoplanetary disks; and (3) considering\nmore realistic scenarios which do not require a fully ionized, powerful T Tauri\nwind in the disk midplane.

We show that, in addition to the\nwell-known Kondo fixed point, the system may flow to a new fixed point\ncontrolled by the Majorana-induced coupling which is characterized by\nnon-trivial correlations between a localized spin on the dot and the fermion\nparity of the topological superconductor and normal lead.

That is,\nthe functor assigning to a module its quantum symmetric algebra is left adjoint\nto a forgetful functor. We also prove a conjecture of Berenstein and Zwicknagl,\nstating that the quantum symmetric and exterior cubes exhibit the same amount\nof \"collapsing\" relative to their classical counterparts. We prove that those\nquantum exterior algebras that are flat deformations of their classical\nanalogues are Frobenius algebras. We also develop a rigorous framework for\ndiscussing continuity and limits of the structures involved as the deformation\nparameter q varies along the positive real line.\n  The second part deals with quantum analogues of Clifford algebras and their\napplication to the noncommutative geometry of certain quantum homogeneous\nspaces. We introduce the quantum Clifford algebra through its spinor\nrepresentation via creation and annihilation operators on one of the flat\nquantum exterior algebras discussed in the first part. The proof that the\nspinor representation is irreducible relies on the Frobenius property discussed\npreviously. We use this quantum Clifford algebra to revisit Krahmer's\nconstruction of a Dolbeault-Dirac-type operator on a quantized irreducible flag\nmanifold.

Detonations in\nthese thin helium layers have speeds slower than the Chapman-Jouget (CJ) speed\nfrom complete helium burning, v_cj=1.5e9 cm/s.

The phenomenology of such\nBondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) accretors is particularly rich when an accretion\ndisc forms around the secondary. The outer radius of such discs is commonly\nestimated from the net angular momentum produced by a density variation of\nmaterial across the BHL or Bondi accretion cylinder, as the latter is tilted\nwith respect to the direction to the primary due to orbital motion. But this\napproach has ignored the fact that the wind experiences an outward driving\nforce that the secondary does not. In actuality, the accretion stream falls\ntoward a retarded point in the secondary's orbit as the secondary is pulled\ntoward the primary relative to the stream. The result is a finite separation or\n\"accretion stream impact parameter\" (ASIP) separating the secondary and stream.\nWhen the orbital radius a_o exceeds the BHL radius r_b, the ratio of outer disc\nradius estimated as the ASIP to the conventional estimate\na_o^{1/2}/r_b^{1/2}>1. We therefore predict that discs will form at larger\nradii from the secondary than traditional estimates. This agrees with the\nimportance of the ASIP emphasized by Huarte-Espinosa et al.

It turns out that the stochastically\ngeneralized TO (GTO) of the DS theory is the finite-time Fokker-Planck\nevolution operator. As a result comes the supersymmetric trivialization of the\nso-called sharp trace and sharp determinant of the GTO, with the former being\nthe Witten index, which is also the stochastic generalization of the Lefschetz\nindex so that it equals the Euler characteristic of the (closed) phase space\nfor any flow vector field, noise metric, and temperature.

We\nassert that the notion of `levels of structure', the coupling strength between\nconstituents in different levels, and the use of collective variables in each\nlevel are all pertinent factors. We consider two types of coupling, each\nconstituent particle is coupled to only one other particle (1-to-1) versus it\ncoupled to all particles (1-to-all). In the 1-1 case with pairwise interactions\nof equal strength, the entanglement is independent of the number of constituent\nparticles $N$ in the macroscopic object. In the 1-to-all case the relative\ncoordinates are decoupled and the center of mass (CoM) coupling scales with\n$N$. We provide a proof of the conditions whereby the CoM variable decouples, a\ncause for the special role the CoM variable plays in the entanglement between\nthe two such macroscopic objects. This qualitative behavior is largely not\naffected by fluctuations in the interaction strength.

The\norigin of these anomalies is still a matter of debate, and so far a\nquantitative description of water's phase behavior starting from the molecular\narrangements is still missing. Here we provide a simple physical description\nfrom microscopic data obtained through computer simulations. We introduce a\nnovel structural order parameter, which quantifies the degree of translational\norder of the second shell, and show that this parameter alone, which measures\nthe amount of locally favored structures, accurately characterizes the state of\nwater. A two-state modeling of these microscopic structures is used to describe\nthe behavior of liquid water over a wide region of the phase diagram, correctly\nidentifying the density and compressibility anomalies, and being compatible\nwith the existence of a second critical point in the deeply supercooled region.\nFurthermore, we reveal that locally favored structures in water not only have\ntranslational order in the second shell, but also contain five-membered rings\nof hydrogen-bonded molecules. This suggests their mixed character: the former\nhelps crystallization, whereas the latter causes frustration against\ncrystallization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Aug 2013 05:27:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

The difference between our method and conventional ones is in\nthe signal spaces. Conventional designs are executed in the discrete-time\ndomain, while our design takes account of both the discrete-time and the\ncontinuous-time signals. Namely, our method can take account of the\ncharacteristic of the original analog signal and the influence of the A/D and\nD/A conversion. While the conventional method often indicates that an ideal\ndigital low-pass filter is preferred, we show that the optimal solution need\nnot be an ideal low-pass when the original analog signal is not completely\nband-limited. This fact can not be recognized only in the discrete-time domain.\nMoreover, we consider quantization effects. We discuss the stability and the\nperformance of quantized sampled-data control systems. We justify H-infinity\ncontrol to reduce distortion caused by the quantizer. Then we apply it to\ndifferential pulse code modulation. While the conventional Delta modulator is\nnot optimal and besides not stable, our modulator is stable and optimal with\nrespect to the H-infinity-norm.

In the presented study, four different types of BGRWs\nand an algorithm based on the ant colony optimization (ACO) heuristic were\nconsidered. Regarding the BGRWs, the precise configurations of the lattice\nwalks constructed during the numerical simulations were influenced by two\nparameters: a disorder parameter rho that controls the amount of negative edge\nweights on the lattice and a bias strength B that governs the drift of the\nwalkers along a certain lattice direction. Here, the pivotal observable is the\nprobability that, after termination, a lattice walk exhibits a total negative\nweight, which is here considered as percolating. The behavior of this\nobservable as function of rho for different bias strengths B is put under\nscrutiny. Upon tuning rho, the probability to find such a feasible lattice walk\nincreases from zero to one. This is the key feature of the percolation\ntransition in the NWP model. Here, we address the question how well the\ntransition point rho_c, resulting from numerically exact and \"static\"\nsimulations in terms of the NWP model can be resolved using simple dynamic\nalgorithms that have only local information available, one of the basic\nquestions in the physics of glassy systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Aug 2013 09:34:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-16"}

For 30 years this was\nattributed to a central mass-accreting supermassive black hole (AGN) of low\nluminosity, making LINER galaxies the largest AGN-sub-population, dominating in\nnumbers over higher luminosity Seyfert galaxies and quasars. This, however,\nposes a serious problem. While the inferred energy balance is plausible, many\nLINERs clearly do not contain any other independent signatures of an AGN. Using\nintegral field spectroscopic data from the CALIFA survey, we aim at comparing\nthe observed radial surface brightness profiles with what is expected from\nillumination by an AGN. Essential for this analysis is a proper extraction of\nemission-lines, especially weak lines such as the Balmer Hb line which is\nsuperposed on an absorption trough. To accomplish this, we use the GANDALF code\nwhich simultaneously fits the underlying stellar continuum and emission lines.\nWe show for 48 galaxies with LINER-like emission, that the radial emission-line\nsurface brightness profiles are inconsistent with ionisation by a central\npoint-source and hence cannot be due to an AGN alone. The most probable\nexplanation for the excess LINER-like emission is ionisation by evolved stars\nduring the short but very hot and energetic phase known as post-AGB. This leads\nus to an entirely new interpretation. Post-AGB stars are ubiquitous and their\nionising effect should be potentially observable in every galaxy with gas\npresent and stars older than ~1 Gyr, unless a stronger radiation field from\nyoung hot stars or an AGN outshines them. This means that galaxies with\nLINER-like emission are in fact not a class defined by a property, but rather\nby the absence of a property. It also explains why LINER emission is observed\nmostly in massive galaxies with old stars and little star formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Aug 2013 09:36:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Oct 2013 12:46:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-02"}

In this\npaper, we propose a deflection-compensated BvN (D-BvN) switch architecture to\nenhance the quasi-static scheduling based on BvN decomposition. The D-BvN\nswitches provide capacity guarantee for virtual circuits (VCs) and deflect\nbursty traffic when overflow occurs. The deflection scheme is devised to offset\nthe excessive buffer requirement of each VC when input traffic is bursty. The\ndesign of our conditional deflection mechanism is based on the fact that it is\nunlikely that the traffic input to VCs is all bursty at the same time; most\nlikely some starving VCs have spare capacities when some other VCs are in the\noverflow state. The proposed algorithm makes full use of the spare capacities\nof those starving VCs to deflect the overflow traffic to other inputs and\nprovide bandwidth for the deflected traffic to re-access the desired VC. Our\nanalysis and simulation show that this deflection-compensated mechanism can\nsupport BvN switches to achieve close to 100% throughput of offered load even\nwith bursty input traffic, and reduces the average end-to-end delay and delay\njitter. Also, our result indicates that the packet out-of-sequence probability\ndue to deflection of overflow traffic is negligible, thus only a small\nre-sequencing buffer is needed at each output port.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Aug 2013 10:49:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-21"}

Inspired by chemical reaction networks,\nI demonstrate the utility of expressing the governing equations of arbitrary\nfirst-order dynamical systems (interaction networks) in terms of sums of real\nfunctions (generalized reactions) multiplied by real scalars (generalized\nstoichiometries). Specifically, I examine the mathematical notion of influence\ntopology, which is based on the reaction stoichiometries and the first\nderivatives of the reactions with respect to each species at the steady state\nsolution(s). It is naturally represented as a signed directed bipartite graph\nwith arrows or blunt arrows connecting a species node to a reaction node\n(positive/negative derivative) or a reaction node to a species node\n(positive/negative stoichiometry). The set of all such graphs is denumerable. A\nsignificant reduction in dimensionality is possible through stoichiometric\nscaling, cycle compaction, and temporal scaling. All cycles in a network can be\nread directly from the graph of its influence topology, enabling efficient and\nintuitive computation of the principal minors (sums of products of\nnon-overlapping bipartite cycles) and the Hurwitz determinants (sums of\nproducts of either the principal minors or the bipartite cycles) for testing\nsteady state stability. The stability of a given network is shown to have a\nhierarchical dependence first on its influence topology and then, more\nspecifically, on algebraic conditions (exact functional form of the reactions).\nThe utility of this hierarchical approach to bifurcation analysis is\ndemonstrated on classical networks from control theory, biology, chemistry,\nphysics, and electronics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Aug 2013 12:34:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 Sep 2013 22:04:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-27"}

We find that whether quantum steering is available via the\nstandard measurements of the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen correlations can depend on\nwhich quadrature measurements are inferred from output spectral measurements of\nthe fundamental and the harmonic. Altering the ratios of the cavity loss rates\ncan be used to tune the regions where symmetric steering is available, with the\nresults becoming asymmetric over all frequencies as the cavity damping at the\nfundamental frequency becomes significantly greater than at the harmonic.\n  This asymmetry and its functional dependence on frequency is a potential new\ntool for experimental quantum information science, with possible utility for\nquantum key distribution.

When diffusion is present, the adsorbate configuration is\nsimultaneously changed by two distinct processes, proceeding in parallel:\nadsorption/desorption, which changes the total adsorbate coverage, and lateral\ndiffusion, which is coverage conserving. Inspired by experimental results, we\nhere study the effects of these competing processes by kinetic Monte Carlo\nsimulations of a simple lattice-gas model. In order to untangle the various\neffects, we perform large-scale simulations, in which we monitor coverage,\ncorrelation length, and cluster-size distributions, as well as the behavior of\nrepresentative individual clusters, during desorption. For each initial\nadsorbate configuration, we perform multiple, independent simulations, without\nand with diffusion, respectively. We find that, compared to desorption without\ndiffusion, the coverage-conserving diffusion process produces two competing\neffects: a retardation of the desorption rate, which is associated with a\ncoarsening of the adsorbate configuration, and an acceleration due to\ndesorption of monomers \"evaporated\" from the cluster perimeters. The balance\nbetween these two effects is governed by the structure of the adsorbate layer\nat the beginning of the desorption process. Deceleration and coarsening are\npredominant for configurations dominated by monomers and small clusters, while\nacceleration is predominant for configurations dominated by large clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Aug 2013 14:14:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-18"}
