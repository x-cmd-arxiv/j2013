This poses a fundamental limitation to optically imaging, sensing,\nand manipulating targets embedded in opaque scattering layers such as\nbiological tissues. One strategy for mitigating the shallow wave penetration is\nto exploit eigenmodes with anomalously high transmittance existing in any\ndisordered medium. When waves are coupled to these eigenmodes, strong\nconstructive wave interference enhances deeply penetrating waves. However,\nfinding such eigenmodes has been a challenging task due to the complexity of\ndisordered media. In this Letter, we present an iterative wavefront control\nmethod that selectively enriches the coupling of incident beam to\nhigh-transmission eigenmodes.

Besides, fast \"semi-analytic\" methods still have to\nincorporate the success obtained with simulations. In this paper we discuss the\ncontribution of the magnification in gravitational arc statistics. Although\nlensing conserves surface brightness, the magnification increases the\nsignal-to-noise ratio of the arcs, enhancing their detectability. We present an\napproach to include this and other observational effects in semi-analytic\ncalculations for arc statistics. The cross section for arc formation ({\\sigma})\nis computed through a semi-analytic method based on the ratio of the\neigenvalues of the magnification tensor. Using this approach we obtained the\nscaling of {\\sigma} with respect to the magnification, and other parameters,\nallowing for a fast computation of the cross section. We apply this method to\nevaluate the expected number of arcs per cluster using an elliptical\nNavarro--Frenk--White matter distribution. Our results show that the\nmagnification has a strong effect on the arc abundance, enhancing the fraction\nof arcs, moving the peak of the arc fraction to higher redshifts, and softening\nits decrease at high redshifts.

Therefore, it important\nto understand under what conditions the Lya line can be used as a reliable star\nformation diagnostic tool. We use a sample of 24 Lya emitters at z ~ 0.3 with\nan optical spectroscopic follow-up to calculate the Lya escape fraction and its\ndependency upon different physical properties. We also examine the reliability\nof Lya as a star formation rate indicator. We combine these observations with a\ncompilation of Lya emitters selected at z = 0 - 0.3 to assemble a larger\nsample. The Lya escape fraction depends clearly on the dust extinction\nfollowing the relation fesc(Lya) = C(Lya) x 10^(-0.4 E(B-V) k(Lya)), but with a\nshallower slope than previously reported, with k(Lya) ~ 6.67 and C(Lya) = 0.22.\nHowever, the correlation does not follow the expected curve for a simple dust\nattenuation. We explore the various mechanisms than lead to fesc(Lya) values\nabove the continuum extinction curve, i.e. to an enhancement of the Lya output.\nWe also observe that the strength of Lya and the escape fraction appear\nunrelated to the galaxy metallicity. Regarding the reliability of Lya as a star\nformation rate (SFR) indicator, we show that the deviation of SFR(Lya) from the\ntrue SFR (as traced by the UV continuum) is a function of the observed SFR(UV),\nwhich can be seen as the decrease of fesc(Lya) with increasing UV luminosity.\nMoreover, we observe a redshift-dependence of this relationship revealing the\nunderlying evolution of fesc(Lya) with redshift.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Aug 2013 20:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

Our new data enables comparison of the kinematic\nmorphology relation in three very different clusters (Virgo, Coma and Abell\n1689) as well as to the field/group environment. The Coma sample was selected\nto match the parent luminosity and ellipticity distributions of the early-type\npopulation within a radius 15' (0.43 Mpc) of the cluster centre, and is limited\nto r' = 16 mag (equivalent to M_K = -21.5 mag), sampling one third of that\npopulation. From analysis of the lambda-ellipticity diagram, we find 15+-6% of\nearly-type galaxies are slow rotators; this is identical to the fraction found\nin the field and the average fraction in the Virgo cluster, based on the\nATLAS3D data. It is also identical to the average fraction found recently in\nAbell 1689 by D'Eugenio et al.. Thus it appears that the average slow rotator\nfraction of early type galaxies remains remarkably constant across many\ndifferent environments, spanning five orders of magnitude in galaxy number\ndensity. However, within each cluster the slow rotators are generally found in\nregions of higher projected density, possibly as a result of mass segregation\nby dynamical friction. These results provide firm constraints on the mechanisms\nthat produce early-type galaxies: they must maintain a fixed ratio between the\nnumber of fast rotators and slow rotators while also allowing the total\nearly-type fraction to increase in clusters relative to the field. A complete\nsurvey of Coma, sampling hundreds rather than tens of galaxies, could probe a\nmore representative volume of Coma and provide significantly stronger\nconstraints, particularly on how the slow rotator fraction varies at larger\nradii.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Aug 2013 20:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

Using a large, mass-limited sample of massive galaxy clusters from\na high-resolution hydrodynamical cosmological simulation, in this work we show\nthat in addition to turbulent and bulk gas velocities, acceleration of gas\nintroduces biases in the hydrostatic mass estimate of galaxy clusters. In\nunrelaxed clusters, the acceleration bias is comparable to the bias due to\nnon-thermal pressure associated with merger-induced turbulent and bulk gas\nmotions. In relaxed clusters, the mean mass bias due to acceleration is small\n(<3%), but the scatter in the mass bias can be reduced by accounting for gas\nacceleration.

Using time-resolved experiments, we show\nthat the strong nanoplasmonic field confinement allows nonlinear interaction to\noccur on an ultrafast timescale of 1.98 +/- 0.40 ps, despite the long\nfree-carrier lifetime in silicon. These findings uncover a new strong-field\ninteraction that can be used in sensitive nanoplasmonic modulators and hybrid\nplasmonic-electronic transducers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Aug 2013 21:15:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-02"}

The utility of the method is\ndemonstrated via several examples, with particular emphasis on sampling\nlabelled graphs with given degree sequence, a well-studied problem for which\nexisting algorithms leave much room for improvement.

The knowledge\nrepresentation of our framework is based on a spatial-temporal-causal And-Or\ngraph (S/T/C-AOG), which jointly models possible hierarchical compositions of\nobjects, scenes and events as well as their interactions and mutual contexts,\nand specifies the prior probabilistic distribution of the parse graphs. We\npresent a probabilistic generative model for joint parsing that captures the\nrelations between the input video/text, their corresponding parse graphs and\nthe joint parse graph. Based on the probabilistic model, we propose a joint\nparsing system consisting of three modules: video parsing, text parsing and\njoint inference. Video parsing and text parsing produce two parse graphs from\nthe input video and text respectively. The joint inference module produces a\njoint parse graph by performing matching, deduction and revision on the video\nand text parse graphs.

For this reason, graph problems\nhave been of interest since the early days of computer science. Some of these\nproblems consider substructures of a graph that have certain properties. These\nsubstructures of interest, generally called patterns, are often meaningful in\nthe domain being modeled. Classic examples of patterns include spanning trees,\ncycles and subgraphs.\n  This thesis focuses on the topic of explicitly listing all the patterns\nexisting in an input graph. One of the defining features of this problem is\nthat the number of patterns is frequently exponential on the size of the input\ngraph. Thus, the time complexity of listing algorithms is parameterized by the\nsize of the output.\n  The main contribution of this work is the presentation of optimal algorithms\nfor four different problems of listing patterns in graphs, namely the listing\nof k-subtrees, k-subgraphs, st-paths and cycles. The algorithms presented are\nframed within the same generic approach, based in a recursive partition of the\nsearch space that divides the problem into subproblems. The key to an efficient\nimplementation of this approach is to avoid recursing into subproblems that do\nnot list any patterns. With this goal in sight, a dynamic data structure,\ncalled the certificate, is introduced and maintained throughout the recursion.\nMoreover, properties of the recursion tree and lower bounds on the number of\npatterns are used to amortize the cost of the algorithm on the size of the\noutput.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Aug 2013 02:10:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-02"}

Recently, a series of graph evolution processes\nhave been introduced that lead to discontinuous percolation transitions where\nthe addition of a single edge causes the size of the largest component to\nexhibit a significant macroscopic jump in the thermodynamic limit. These\nprocesses can have additional exotic behaviors, such as displaying a `Devil's\nstaircase' of discrete jumps in the supercritical regime. Here we investigate\nwhether the location of the largest jump coincides with the percolation\nthreshold for a range of processes, such as Erdos-Renyi percolation,\npercolation via edge competition and via growth by overtaking. We find that the\nlargest jump asymptotically occurs at the percolation transition for\nErdos-Renyi and other processes exhibiting global continuity, including models\nexhibiting an `explosive' transition. However, for percolation processes\nexhibiting genuine discontinuities, the behavior is substantially richer. In\npercolation models where the order parameter exhibits a staircase, the largest\ndiscontinuity generically does not coincide with the percolation transition.\nFor the generalized Bohman-Frieze-Wormald model, it depends on the model\nparameter. Distinct parameter regimes well in the supercritical regime feature\nunstable discontinuous transitions, which is a novel and unexpected phenomenon\nin percolation.

For typical SNR parameters the CR protons can be accelerated to\nPeV energies only if the region of amplified field ahead of the shock is\nextensive enough to contain the diffusion lengths of the particles of interest.\nEven with the help of Alfv'enic drift, it remains somewhat challenging to\nconstruct a nonlinear DSA model for SNRs in which order of 10 % of the\nsupernova explosion energy is converted to the CR energy and the magnetic field\nis amplified by a factor of 10 or so in the shock precursor, while, at the same\ntime, the energy spectrum of PeV protons is steeper than E^{-2}.

We show the redshift evolution\nof O and N abundances and specific star formation rates for different galaxy\nmass ranges, demonstrating the galaxy downsizing effect caused by less massive\nprogenitors of less massive galaxies. The O and N abundances do not remain\nconstant for different galaxy mass ranges, and the enrichment (and hence star\nformation) decreases with increasing galaxy stellar mass.

This problem leads to incorrect analyses and critically affects\ndecision making. To enforce summarizability, existing approaches alter either\nMD models or data, and must be applied a priori, on a case-by-case basis, by an\nexpert.

As a consequence of this degeneracy there is again an\namplification phenomenon: outgoing pulses of amplitude $O(\\eps^2)$ and\nwavelength $\\eps$ give rise to reflected pulses of amplitude $O(\\eps)$, so the\noverall solution has amplitude $O(\\eps)$. Moreover, the reflecting pulses\nemanate from a radiating pulse that propagates in the boundary along a\ncharacteristic of the Lopatinskii determinant. In the case of N*N systems\nconsidered here, a single outgoing pulse produces on reflection a family of\nincoming pulses traveling at different group velocities. Unlike wavetrains,\npulses do not interact to produce resonances that affect the leading order\nprofiles. However, pulse interactions do affect lower order profiles and so\nthese interactions have to be estimated carefully in the error analysis.\nWhereas the error analysis in the wavetrain case dealt with small divisor\nproblems by approximating periodic profiles by trigonometric polynomials (which\namounts to using a high frequency cutoff), in the pulse case we approximate\ndecaying profiles with nonzero moments by profiles with zero moments (a low\nfrequency cutoff). Unlike the wavetrain case, we are now able to obtain a rate\nof convergence in the limit describing convergence of approximate to exact\nsolutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Aug 2013 09:06:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-02"}

The World Health Organization (WHO)\ndefines a signal in pharmacovigilance as \"any reported information on a\npossible causal relationship between an adverse event and a drug, the\nrelationship being unknown or incompletely documented previously\".

One receives either n i.i.d. samples from a\ndistribution p in P or from a distribution q in Q and wants to decide from\nwhich set the points were sampled. It is known that the optimal exponential\nrate at which errors decrease can be achieved by a simple maximum-likelihood\nratio test which does not depend on p or q, but only on the sets P and Q.\n  We consider an adaptive generalization of this model where the choice of p in\nP and q in Q can change in each sample in some way that depends arbitrarily on\nthe previous samples. In other words, in the k'th round, an adversary, having\nobserved all the previous samples in rounds 1,...,k-1, chooses p_k in P and q_k\nin Q, with the goal of confusing the hypothesis test. We prove that even in\nthis case, the optimal exponential error rate can be achieved by a simple\nmaximum-likelihood test that depends only on P and Q.\n  We then show that the adversarial model has applications in hypothesis\ntesting for quantum states using restricted measurements. For example, it can\nbe used to study the problem of distinguishing entangled states from the set of\nall separable states using only measurements that can be implemented with local\noperations and classical communication (LOCC).

By combining contrast terms with prior\nterms, it provides accurate segmentations of medical images in a fully\nautomated manner. However, one of the main drawbacks of using the RW algorithm\nis that its parameters have to be hand-tuned. we propose a novel discriminative\nlearning framework that estimates the parameters using a training dataset. The\nmain challenge we face is that the training samples are not fully supervised.\nSpeci cally, they provide a hard segmentation of the images, instead of a\nproba- bilistic segmentation. We overcome this challenge by treating the opti-\nmal probabilistic segmentation that is compatible with the given hard\nsegmentation as a latent variable. This allows us to employ the latent support\nvector machine formulation for parameter estimation. We show that our approach\nsigni cantly outperforms the baseline methods on a challenging dataset\nconsisting of real clinical 3D MRI volumes of skeletal muscles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Aug 2013 12:13:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-02"}

It contains a correspondingly larger number of low mass X-ray binaries\n(LMXBs) associated with GCs, and can be used to investigate the GC properties\nwhich lead to X-ray binary formation. The best tracer of the spatial structure\nof M31 GCs is high-resolution imaging from the Hubble Space Telescope, and we\nhave used HST data to derive structural parameters for 29 LMXB-hosting M31 GCs.\nThese measurements are combined with structural parameters from the literature\nfor a total of 41 (of 50 known) LMXB GCs and a comparison sample of 65 non-LMXB\nGCs. Structural parameters measured in blue bandpasses are found to show\nsmaller core radii and higher concentrations than those measured in red\nbandpasses; this difference is enhanced in LMXB clusters and could be related\nto stellar population differences. Clusters with LMXBs show higher collision\nrates for their mass compared to those without LMXBs and collision rates\nestimated at the core radius show larger offsets than rates estimated at the\nhalf-light radius. These results are consistent with the dynamical formation\nscenario for LMXBs. A logistic regression analysis finds that, as expected, the\nprobability of a GC hosting an LMXB increases with increasing collision rate\nand proximity to the galaxy center. The same analysis finds that P(LMXB)\ndecreases with increasing GC mass at a fixed collision rate, although we\ncaution that this could be due to sample selection effects. Metallicity is\nfound to be a less important predictor of P(LMXB) than collision rate, mass, or\ndistance, even though LMXB GCs have a higher metallicity on average. This may\nbe due to the interaction of location and metallicity: a sample of M31 LMXBs\nwith a greater range in galactocentric distance would likely contain more\nmetal-poor GCs and make it possible to disentangle the two effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Aug 2013 13:55:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

The method in a nutshell consists of\na discrete Fourier transform-based alternating minimization algorithm with\nperiodic boundary conditions and in which two fast Fourier transforms (FFTs)\nare required per iteration. In this paper, we propose an alternating\nminimization algorithm for the continuous version of the total variation image\ndeblurring problem. We establish convergence of the proposed continuous\nalternating minimization algorithm. The continuous setting is very useful to\nhave a unifying representation of the algorithm, independently of the discrete\napproximation of the deconvolution problem, in particular concerning the\nstrategies for dealing with boundary artifacts. Indeed, an accurate restoration\nof blurred and noisy images requires a proper treatment of the boundary. A\ndiscrete version of our continuous alternating minimization algorithm is\nobtained following two different strategies: the imposition of appropriate\nboundary conditions and the enlargement of the domain. The first one is\ncomputationally useful in the case of a symmetric blur, while the second one\ncan be efficiently applied for a nonsymmetric blur. Numerical tests show that\nour algorithm generates higher quality images in comparable running times with\nrespect to the Fast Total Variation deconvolution algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Aug 2013 14:22:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-02"}

We indicate the potential relevance of one\nof these corrections for the actively debated phenomenon of Dark Radiation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Aug 2013 15:38:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-02"}
