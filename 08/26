This spectrum shows an impressive richness\nof spectral details and enigmatic Q/I signals, whose physical origin must be\nclearly understood before they can be exploited for diagnostic purposes. The\nmost enduring enigma is represented by the polarization signals observed in the\nD1 resonance lines of Na I (5896 A) and Ba II (4934 A), which were expected to\nbe intrinsically unpolarizable. The totality of sodium and 18% of barium have\nhyperfine structure (HFS), and it has been argued that the only way to produce\na scattering polarization signal in such lines is through the presence of a\nsubstantial amount of atomic polarization in their lower HFS levels. The strong\nsensitivity of these long-lived levels to depolarizing mechanisms led to the\nparadoxical conclusion that the observed D1-line polarization is incompatible\nwith the presence in the lower solar chromosphere of inclined magnetic fields\nsensibly stronger than 0.01 G. Here we show that by properly taking into\naccount the fact that the solar D1-line radiation has a non-negligible spectral\nstructure over the short frequency interval spanned by the HFS transitions, it\nis possible to produce scattering polarization signals in the D1 lines of Na I\nand Ba II without the need of ground-level polarization. The resulting linear\npolarization is not so easily destroyed by elastic collisions and/or magnetic\nfields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Aug 2013 16:37:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

However, most population\ngenetic theory assumes that the strength of selection remains constant. Here we\ninvestigate the consequences of fluctuating selection pressures on the\nquantification of adaptive evolution using McDonald-Kreitman (MK) style\napproaches. In agreement with previous work, we show that fluctuating selection\ncan generate evidence of adaptive evolution even when the expected strength of\nselection on a mutation is zero. However, we also find that the mutations,\nwhich contribute to both polymorphism and divergence tend, on average, to be\npositively selected during their lifetime, under fluctuating selection models.\nThis is because mutations that fluctuate, by chance, to positive selected\nvalues, tend to reach higher frequencies in the population than those that\nfluctuate towards negative values. Hence the evidence of positive adaptive\nevolution detected under a fluctuating selection model by MK type approaches is\ngenuine since fixed mutations tend to be advantageous on average during their\nlifetime. Never-the-less we show that methods tend to underestimate the rate of\nadaptive evolution when selection fluctuates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Aug 2013 18:00:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-05"}

The spectral density can be viewed as a probability\ndensity distribution that measures the likelihood of finding eigenvalues near\nsome point on the real line. The most straightforward way to obtain this\ndensity is to compute all eigenvalues of $A$. But this approach is generally\ncostly and wasteful, especially for matrices of large dimension. There exists\nalternative methods that allow us to estimate the spectral density function at\nmuch lower cost. The major computational cost of these methods is in\nmultiplying $A$ with a number of vectors, which makes them appealing for\nlarge-scale problems where products of the matrix $A$ with arbitrary vectors\nare relatively inexpensive. This paper defines the problem of estimating the\nspectral density carefully, and discusses how to measure the accuracy of an\napproximate spectral density. It then surveys a few known methods for\nestimating the spectral density, and proposes some new variations of existing\nmethods.

Reconstructing the muon\ntrack from the observed light is challenging due to noise, light scattering in\nthe ice medium, and the possibility of simultaneously having multiple muons\ninside the detector, resulting from the large flux of cosmic ray muons. This\nmanuscript describes work on two problems: (1) the track reconstruction\nproblem, in which, given a set of observations, the goal is to recover the\ntrack of a muon; and (2) the coincident event problem, which is to determine\nhow many muons are active in the detector during a time window. Rather than\nsolving these problems by developing more complex physical models that are\napplied at later stages of the analysis, our approach is to augment the\ndetectors early reconstruction with data filters and robust statistical\ntechniques. These can be implemented at the level of on-line reconstruction\nand, therefore, improve all subsequent reconstructions. Using the metric of\nmedian angular resolution, a standard metric for track reconstruction, we\nimprove the accuracy in the initial reconstruction direction by 13%.

In particular, we describe the clickstream\ndissipation on threads using the function $D_i \\sim T_i ^ \\gamma$, in which\n$T_i$ is the clickstreams to node $i$ and $D_i$ is the clickstream dissipated\nfrom $i$. It turns out that $\\gamma$, an indicator for dissipation efficiency,\nis negatively correlated with $\\theta$ and $1/\\gamma$ sets the lower boundary\nfor $\\theta$. Our findings have practical consequences. For example, $\\theta$\ncan be used as a measure of the \"stickiness\" of forums, because it quantifies\nthe stable ability of forums to convert $UV$ into $PV$, i.e., to remain users\n\"lock-in\" the forum. Meanwhile, the correlation between $\\gamma$ and $\\theta$\nprovides a convenient method to evaluate the `stickiness\" of forums. Finally,\nwe discuss an optimized \"body mass\" of forums at around $10^5$ that minimizes\n$\\gamma$ and maximizes $\\theta$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Aug 2013 08:46:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Aug 2013 09:25:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

Before using them as efficient tools in the early Universe,\nhowever, the environmental factors that govern the formation of GRBs need to be\nunderstood. Metallicity is theoretically thought to be a fundamental driver in\nGRB explosions and energetics, but is still, even after more than a decade of\nextensive studies, not fully understood. This is largely related to two\nphenomena: a dust-extinction bias, that prevented high-mass and thus likely\nhigh-metallicity GRB hosts to be detected in the first place, and a lack of\nefficient instrumentation, that limited spectroscopic studies including\nmetallicity measurements to the low-redshift end of the GRB host population.\nThe subject of this work is the very energetic GRB 110918A, for which we\nmeasure one of the largest host-integrated metallicities, ever, and the highest\nstellar mass for z<1.9. This presents one of the very few robust metallicity\nmeasurements of GRB hosts at z~1, and establishes that GRB hosts at z~1 can\nalso be very metal rich.

We now have a sample of 1987A-like SNe that arise from the core\ncollapse (CC) of BSGs. The metallicity of the explosion sites of the known BSG\nSNe is investigated, as well as their association to star-forming regions. Both\nindirect and direct metallicity measurements of 13 BSG SN host galaxies are\npresented, and compared to those of other CC SN types. Indirect measurements\nare based on the known luminosity-metallicity relation and on published\nmetallicity gradients of spiral galaxies. To provide direct estimates based on\nstrong line diagnostics, we obtained spectra of each BSG SN host both at the SN\nexplosion site and at the positions of other HII regions. Continuum-subtracted\nHa images allowed us to quantify the association between BSG SNe and\nstar-forming regions. BSG SNe explode either in low-luminosity galaxies or at\nlarge distances from the nuclei of luminous hosts. Therefore, their indirectly\nmeasured metallicities are typically lower than those of SNe IIP and Ibc. This\nis confirmed by the direct estimates, which show slightly sub-solar values\n(12+log(O/H)=8.3-8.4 dex), similar to that of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC),\nwhere SN 1987A exploded. However, two SNe (1998A and 2004em) were found at near\nsolar metallicity. SNe IIb have a metallicity distribution similar to that of\nBSG SNe. Finally, the association to star-forming regions is similar among BSG\nSNe, SNe IIP and IIn. Our results suggest that LMC metal abundances play a role\nin the formation of some 1987A-like SNe. This would naturally fit in a single\nstar scenario for the progenitors. However, the existence of two events at\nnearly solar metallicity suggests that also other channels, e.g. binarity,\ncontribute to produce BSG SNe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Aug 2013 11:19:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-26"}

First we give a\ndetailed description of the structure of the geometric limit set and relate it\nto the limit cone; moreover, we show that the action of the group on a quotient\nof the regular geometric boundary of X is minimal and proximal. This is\ncompletely analogous to the case of Zariski dense discrete subgroups of\nsemi-simple Lie groups acting on the associated symmetric space. In the second\npart of the paper we study the distribution of orbit points in X: As a\ngeneralization of the critical exponent we consider the exponential growth rate\nof the number of orbit points in X with a prescribed \"slope\". We show in\nparticular that this exponential growth rate is strictly positive in the\nrelative interior of the limit cone and that there exists a unique slope for\nwhich it is maximal and equal to the critical exponent.\n  We notice that an interesting class of product spaces as above comes from the\nsecond alternative in the Rank Rigidity Theorem for CAT(0)-cube complexes:\nGiven a finite-dimensional CAT(0)-cube complex X and a group G of automorphisms\nwithout fixed point in the geometric compactification of X, then either G\ncontains a rank one isometry or there exists a convex F-invariant subcomplex of\nX which is a product of two unbounded cube subcomplexes; in the latter case one\ninductively gets a convex G-invariant subcomplex of X which can be decomposed\ninto a finite product of rank one Hadamard spaces.

Algorithms for richer\nclasses of XPath rewritings, using intersection or joins on node identifiers,\nhave been proposed, but they either lack completeness guarantees, or require\nadditional information about the data. We identify the tightest restrictions\nunder which an XPath can be rewritten in polynomial time using an intersection\nof views and propose an algorithm that works for any documents or type of\nidentifiers. As a side-effect, we analyze the complexity of the related problem\nof deciding if an XPath with intersection can be equivalently rewritten as one\nwithout intersection or union.

This algorithms\ninvolves an approximate Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) probability scheme for\ndetection of the location of taps, while a least square method is used for\nestimating the values at each iteration. In this work, based on the method of\nfactor graphs and message passing algorithms, we will compute an exact solution\nfor the MAP estimation problem. Indeed, we first find a factor graph model of\nthis problem, and then perform the well-known min-sum algorithm on the edges of\nthis graph. Consequently, we will find an exact estimator for the MAP problem\nthat its complexity grows linearly with respect to the channel memory. By\nsubstituting this estimator in the mentioned alternating minimization method,\nwe will propose an estimator that will nearly achieve the Cramer-Rao bound of\nthe genie-aided estimation of sparse channels (estimation based on knowing the\nlocation of non-zero taps of the channel), while it can perform faster than\nmost of the proposed algorithms in literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Aug 2013 14:26:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-27"}

Despite its efficiency, a potential problem\nis that using pre-constructed sine-cosine waves as the required reference\nsignals in the CCA method often does not result in the optimal recognition\naccuracy due to their lack of features from the real EEG data. To address this\nproblem, this study proposes a novel method based on multiset canonical\ncorrelation analysis (MsetCCA) to optimize the reference signals used in the\nCCA method for SSVEP frequency recognition. The MsetCCA method learns multiple\nlinear transforms that implement joint spatial filtering to maximize the\noverall correlation among canonical variates, and hence extracts SSVEP common\nfeatures from multiple sets of EEG data recorded at the same stimulus\nfrequency. The optimized reference signals are formed by combination of the\ncommon features and completely based on training data. Experimental study with\nEEG data from ten healthy subjects demonstrates that the MsetCCA method\nimproves the recognition accuracy of SSVEP frequency in comparison with the CCA\nmethod and other two competing methods (multiway CCA (MwayCCA) and phase\nconstrained CCA (PCCA)), especially for a small number of channels and a short\ntime window length.

As another possible cause, I investigate the\nhypothesis that the modulation is generated by the Fourier transform of\nspectral lines, concluding that it is not valid. Although the light bursts\nsuggestion implies absurdly high temperatures, it is supported by the fact that\nthe Crab pulsar also has extremely short unresolved pulses (<0.5 nanosecond)\nthat also imply absurdly high temperatures. Furthermore, the radio spectrum of\nthe Crab pulsar also has spectral bands similar to those that have been\ndetected. Finally, decreasing the signal to noise threshold of detection gave\nresults consistent with beamed signals having a small beam divergence, as\nexpected from non-thermal sources that send a jet, like those seen in pulsars.\nConsidering that galaxy centers contain massive black holes, exotic black hole\nphysics may be responsible for the spectral modulation. However, at this stage,\nthis is only a hypothesis to be confirmed with further work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Aug 2013 15:13:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

Using the\nproperties of orthogonal polynomials, the method transforms polynomial\ndifferential equation to D-dimensional radial Schrodinger equation which\nfacilitates construction of exactly solvable quantum systems. The method is\nalso applied using associated Laguerre and Hypergeometric polynomials. The\nquantum systems generated from other polynomials are also briefly highlighted.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Aug 2013 06:42:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}
