With a simulated data set of 101 GRBs with a central\nvalue of the correlation slope that differs on the intrinsic one by a $5\\sigma$\nfactor, we find an overstimated value of the matter density parameter,\n$\\Omega_M$, compared to the value obtained with SNe Ia, while the Hubble\nconstant, $H_0$, best fit value is still compatible in 1$\\sigma$ compared to\nother probes. We show that this compatibility of $H_0$ is due to the large\nintrinsic scatter associated with the simulated sample. Instead, if we consider\na subsample of high luminous GRBs ($HighL$), we find that both the evaluation\nof $H_0$ and $\\Omega_M$ are not more compatible in 1$\\sigma$ and $\\Omega_M$ is\nunderestimated by the $13\\%$.

In literature so far GRB correlations are not corrected\nfor redshift evolution and selection biases, therefore we are not aware of\ntheir intrinsic slopes and consequently how far the use of the observed\ncorrelations can influence the derived `best' cosmological settings.

The hard\nrods are represented as hard cylinders of diameter $D$ and length $L$, while\nthe cylindrical pore is infinite with diameter $W$. The interaction between the\nwall and the rods is hard repulsive, and it is assumed that molecules are\nparallel to the surface of the pore (planar anchoring). In very narrow pores\n($D<W<2 D$), the structure is homogeneous and the system behaves as a\none-dimensional Tonks gas.

In an earlier paper, we have\npresented a Chandra data analysis of the coronae of 53 nearby highly-inclined\ndisc galaxies. Here we study the correlation of the X-ray measurements with\nother galaxy properties and compare the results with those obtained for\nelliptical galaxies. A good correlation is present between the coronal\nluminosity Lx and the SFR. But we find a better correlation between Lx and the\ntotal SN mechanical energy input rate (ESN), including the expected\ncontribution from core collapsed (CC) and Ia SNe. The X-ray radiation\nefficiency (eta=Lx/ESN) has a mean value of ~0.4% with an rms of ~0.5dex. eta\nfurther correlates with MTF/M* (MTF is the baryon mass measured from the\nrotation velocity and the Tully-Fisher relation, M* is the stellar mass\nmeasured from the K-band luminosity) and the CC SN rate surface density (FSN,\nin units of SN/yr/kpc^2), which can be characterized as: eta=0.41%MTF/M* and\neta=1.4%FSN^-0.3. These correlations reflect the roles played by the\ngravitational mass and energetic feedback concentrations in determining eta.\nThe characteristic temperature of the corona shows little dependence on the\ntotal or specific SFR, the cold gas content, or Lx. The coronae of disc\ngalaxies tend to be more X-ray luminous, hotter, and lower in Fe/O abundance\nratio than those of elliptical ones of similar masses. Early-type non-starburst\ndisc galaxies tend to be more Fe-rich, while starburst ones have a roughly\nconstant abundance ratio of Fe/O~0.36solar. Our results are consistent with the\ncoronal gas being mainly provided by stellar feedback in a mass range of\nM*~10^{8.7-11}Msun. In addition, processes such as charge exchange at cool/hot\ngas interfaces, as well as various environmental effects, are also needed to\nexplain the diversity of coronal properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Aug 2013 18:59:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

To investigate seismic wave amplification in such cases, past studies\nhave been devoted to one-directional shear wave propagation in a soil column\n(1D-propagation) considering one motion component only (1C-polarization). Three\nindependent purely 1C computations may be performed ('1D-1C' approach) and\ndirectly superimposed in the case of weak motions (linear behaviour). This\nresearch aims at studying local site effects by considering seismic wave\npropagation in a 1-D soil profile accounting for the influence of the 3-D\nloading path and non-linear hysteretic behaviour of the soil. In the proposed\n'1D-3C' approach, the three components (3C-polarization) of the incident wave\nare simultaneously propagated into a horizontal multilayered soil. A 3-D\nnon-linear constitutive relation for the soil is implemented in the framework\nof the Finite Element Method in the time domain. The complex rheology of soils\nis modelled by mean of a multisurface cyclic plasticity model of the\nMasing-Prandtl-Ishlinskii-Iwan type. The great advantage of this choice is that\nthe only data needed to describe the model is the modulus reduction curve. A\nparametric study is carried out to characterize the changes in the seismic\nmotion of the surficial layers due to both incident wavefield properties and\nsoil non-linearities. The numerical simulations show a seismic response\ndepending on several parameters such as polarization of seismic waves, material\nelastic and dynamic properties, as well as on the impedance contrast between\nlayers and frequency content and oscillatory character of the input motion. The\n3-D loading path due to the 3C-polarization leads to multi-axial stress\ninteraction that reduces soil strength and increases non-linear effects. The\nnon-linear behaviour of the soil may have beneficial or detrimental effects on\nthe seismic response at the free surface, depending on the energy dissipation\nrate. Free surface time histories, stress-strain hysteresis loops and in-depth\nprofiles of octahedral stress and strain are estimated for each soil column.\nThe combination of three separate 1D-1C non-linear analyses is compared to the\nproposed 1D-3C approach, evidencing the influence of the 3C-polarization and\nthe 3-D loading path on strong seismic motions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Aug 2013 19:28:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-12"}

The algorithm guarantees that each node receives\nsufficiently many substreams within delay logarithmic in the number of peers.\nThe algorithm works by constantly updating the topology so that each substream\nis distributed through trees to as many nodes as possible without interference.\nCompetition among trees for limited upload capacity is managed so that both\ncoverage and balance are achieved. The algorithm is robust in that it\nefficiently eliminates cycles and maintains tree structures in a distributed\nway. The algorithm favors nodes with higher degree, so it not only works for\nlive streaming and video on demand, but also in the case a few nodes with large\ndegree act as servers and other nodes act as clients.\n  A proof of convergence of the algorithm is given assuming instantaneous\nupdate of depth information, and for the case of a single tree it is shown that\nthe convergence time is stochastically tightly bounded by a small constant\ntimes the log of the number of nodes.

Protein contact map describes the pairwise spatial and functional\nrelationship of residues in a protein and contains key information for protein\n3D structure prediction. Although studied extensively, it remains very\nchallenging to predict contact map using only sequence information. Most\nexisting methods predict the contact map matrix element-by-element, ignoring\ncorrelation among contacts and physical feasibility of the whole contact map. A\ncouple of recent methods predict contact map based upon residue co-evolution,\ntaking into consideration contact correlation and enforcing a sparsity\nrestraint, but these methods require a very large number of sequence homologs\nfor the protein under consideration and the resultant contact map may be still\nphysically unfavorable.\n  Results. This paper presents a novel method PhyCMAP for contact map\nprediction, integrating both evolutionary and physical restraints by machine\nlearning and integer linear programming (ILP). The evolutionary restraints\ninclude sequence profile, residue co-evolution and context-specific statistical\npotential. The physical restraints specify more concrete relationship among\ncontacts than the sparsity restraint. As such, our method greatly reduces the\nsolution space of the contact map matrix and thus, significantly improves\nprediction accuracy. Experimental results confirm that PhyCMAP outperforms\ncurrently popular methods no matter how many sequence homologs are available\nfor the protein under consideration. PhyCMAP can predict contacts within\nminutes after PSIBLAST search for sequence homologs is done, much faster than\nthe two recent methods PSICOV and EvFold.\n  See http://raptorx.uchicago.edu for the web server.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Aug 2013 20:44:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 Aug 2013 16:24:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-21"}

However, analysis of CI\nsystems under state-of-the-art reconstruction algorithms, most of which exploit\nsignal prior models, has proven to be unwieldy. In this paper, we present a\ncomprehensive analysis framework incorporating all three components.\n  In order to perform this analysis, we model the signal priors using a\nGaussian Mixture Model (GMM). A GMM prior confers two unique characteristics.\nFirstly, GMM satisfies the universal approximation property which says that any\nprior density function can be approximated to any fidelity using a GMM with\nappropriate number of mixtures. Secondly, a GMM prior lends itself to\nanalytical tractability allowing us to derive simple expressions for the\n`minimum mean square error' (MMSE), which we use as a metric to characterize\nthe performance of CI systems. We use our framework to analyze several\npreviously proposed CI techniques, giving conclusive answer to the question:\n`How much performance gain is due to use of a signal prior and how much is due\nto multiplexing?\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Aug 2013 21:21:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Oct 2013 23:13:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 13 Mar 2014 16:13:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-14"}

Both moons have significant\neccentricities and inclinations, in a pattern that is consistent with a past\norbital resonance (Ragozzine and Brown, 2009). Based on our analysis, we find\nthat the present system is not consistent with satellite formation close to the\nprimary and tidal evolution though mean-motion resonances. We propose that\nNamaka experienced only limited tidal evolution, leading to the mutual 8:3\nmean-motion resonance which redistributed eccentricities and inclinations\nbetween the moons. This scenario requires that the original orbit of Hi'iaka\nwas mildly eccentric; we propose that this eccentricity was either primordial\nor acquired though encounters with other TNOs. Both dynamical stability and our\npreferred tidal evolution model imply that the moons' masses are only about one\nhalf of previously estimated values, suggesting high albedos and low densities.\nAs the present orbits of the moons strongly suggest formation from a flat disk\nclose to their present locations, we conclude that Hi'iaka and Namaka may be\nsecond-generation moons, formed after the breakup of a past large moon,\npreviously proposed as the parent body of the Haumea family (Schlichting and\nSari, 2009). We derive plausible parameters of that moon, consistent with the\ncurrent models of Haumea's formation (Leinhardt et al, 2010). An interesting\nimplication of this hypothesis is that Hi'iaka and Namaka may orbit retrograde\nwith respect to Haumea's spin. Retrograde orbits of Haumea's moons would be in\nfull agreement with available observations and our dynamical analysis, and\ncould provide a unique confirmation the \"disrupted satellite\" scenario for the\norigin of the family.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Aug 2013 22:06:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

The molecular triad\nundergoes a photoinduced charge transfer process exhibiting a large excited\nstate dipole moment, making it suitable for application to molecular-scale\nopto-electronic devices. An important consideration is that the conformational\nflexibility of the CPC 60 triad impacts its dynamics in solvents. Since\nexperimentally measured dipole moments for the triad of ~110 Debye (D) and ~160\nDebye strongly indicate a range in conformational variability for the triad in\nthe excited state, studying the effect of conformational changes on the CT\nexcited state energetics furthers the understanding of its charge transfer\nstates. We have calculated the lowest CT excited state energies for a series of\n14 triad conformers, where the structural conformations were generated by\nincrementally scanning a 360 degree torsional (dihedral) twist at the\nC60-porhyrin linkage and the porphyrin-carotenoid linkage. Additionally, five\ndifferent CPC60 conformations were studied to determine the effect of\npi-conjugation and particle-hole Coulombic attraction on the CT excitation\nenergies. Our calculations show that structural conformational changes in the\ntriad show a variation of ~0.4 eV in CT excited state energies in the\ngas-phase. The corresponding calculated excited state dipoles show a range of\n88 D - 188 D.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Aug 2013 23:59:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

In contrast, an\nenergy re-ordering for the tetra-sulfonated ZnPc system leads to local\nexcitations lying lower in energy than the CT state, displaying a possible\ndeactivation pathway obstructing charge separation. Since several different\ndonor-acceptor relative orientations may co-exist at an organic heterojunction,\nwe compare the energetics of a few low-lying CT states for the end-on geometry\nof a di-sulfonated system to its co-facial orientation counterpart. The\ncalculated CT excitation energies are larger for the end-on orientation in\ncomparison to the co-facial structure by ~1.5 eV, which results principally\nfrom a substantial decrease in exciton binding energy in going from the\nco-facial to the end-on orientation. Furthermore, changes in relative\ndonor-acceptor orientation have a larger impact on the CT energies than changes\nin donor-acceptor distance. TDDFT calculations on the various sulfonated ZnPc\ndonor molecules show a significant splitting of the Q-band for only one of the\nfour donor systems.

Diversity coding is the first\ntechnique to incorporate coding in this field and is easy to implement over\nsmall arbitrary networks. However, its capacity efficiency is restricted by its\nsystematic coding and high design complexity even though its design complexity\nis lower than the other coding-based recovery techniques. Alternative\ntechniques mitigate some of these limitations, but they are difficult to\nimplement over arbitrary networks. In this paper, we propose a simple column\ngeneration-based design algorithm and a novel advanced diversity coding\ntechnique to achieve near-hitless recovery over arbitrary networks. The design\nframework consists of two parts: a main problem and subproblem. Main problem is\nrealized with Linear Programming (LP) and Integer Linear Programming (ILP),\nwhereas the subproblem can be realized with different methods. The simulation\nresults suggest that both the novel coding structure and the novel design\nalgorithm lead to higher capacity efficiency for near-hitless recovery.

Therefore, it is\nnecessary to develop efficient assembly-independent methods for accurate\nestimation of these genomic characteristics. Results: Here we present a\nframework for modeling the distribution of k-mer frequency from sequencing data\nand estimating the genomic characteristics such as genome size, repeat\nstructure and heterozygous rate. By introducing novel techniques of k-mer\nindividuals, float precision estimation, and proper treatment of sequencing\nerror and coverage bias, the estimation accuracy of our method is significantly\nimproved over existing methods.

We present photometric observations of the\nRW Aur system from the Kilodegree Extremely Little Telescope (KELT) survey\nshowing a long and deep dimming that occurred from September 2010 until March\n2011. The dimming has a depth of ~2 magnitudes, a duration of ~180 days and was\nconfirmed by archival observations from American Association of Variable Star\nObservers (AAVSO). We suggest that this event is the result of a portion of the\ntidally disrupted disk occulting RW Aur A, specifically a fragment of the\ntidally disrupted arm. The calculated transverse linear velocity of the\nocculter is in excellent agreement with the measured relative radial velocity\nof the tidally disrupted arm. Using simple kinematic and geometric arguments,\nwe show that the occulter cannot be a feature of the RW Aur A circumstellar\ndisk, and we consider and discount other hypotheses. We also place constraints\non the thickness and semi-major axis of the portion of the arm that occulted\nthe star.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Aug 2013 02:04:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

We begin by\npointing out that the observed specific star formation rate requires a\nduty-cycle of ~10%, which is much lower than found in many hydro-dynamical\nsimulations. This value follows directly from the fact that the observed star\nformation rate in galaxies integrated over a Hubble time exceeds the observed\nstellar mass by an order of magnitude. We use the large observed specific star\nformation rate to calibrate the efficiency of feedback in a model for the high\nredshift star formation rate which includes merger driven star formation\nregulated by SNe feedback. This model reproduces the star formation rate\ndensity function and the stellar mass function of galaxies at 4<z<7. A\nprediction of the model is that the specific star formation rate does not\nevolve very rapidly with either mass or redshift, in agreement with\nobservation. This is in contrast to results from hydrodynamical simulations\nwhere the star formation closely follows the accretion rate, and so increases\nstrongly towards high redshift. The bursty star formation model naturally\nexplains the observation that there is not enough stellar mass at z~2-4 to\naccount for all of the star-formation observed, without invoking properties\nlike an evolving initial mass function of stars. The finding of a duty cycle\nthat is ~10% implies that there should be ten times the number of known\ngalaxies at fixed stellar mass that have not yet been detected through standard\nUV selection at high redshift. We therefore predict the existence of a large\nundetected population of UV-faint galaxies that accounts for most of the\nstellar mass density at z~4-8.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Aug 2013 04:28:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

The discontinuity in angular momenta between the outer infalling gas and\ninner Keplerian circumbinary disk implies an abrupt transition in the\neffectiveness at which magnetic braking is able to transfer angular momentum\noutwards, a result perhaps of the different plasma beta and ionization\nfractions between the outer and inner regions of the circumbinary disk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Aug 2013 08:48:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

We study how the radial\nabundance gradients vary as a function of height above the plane and find that\nthe metallicity ([alpha/Fe]) gradient becomes more positive (negative) with\nincreasing height, changing sign around 1.5 kpc above the plane. At the largest\nvertical height (2 < |z| < 3 kpc), our simulated galaxy shows a positive radial\nmetallicity gradient. We find that the positive metallicity gradient is caused\nby the age-metallicity and age-velocity dispersion relation, where the younger\nstars have higher metallicity and lower velocity dispersion. Due to the\nage-velocity dispersion relation, a greater fraction of younger stars reach |z|\n> 2 kpc at the outer region, because of the lower gravitational restoring force\nof the disk, i.e. flaring. As a result, the fraction of younger stars with\nhigher metallicity due to the age-metallicity relation becomes higher at the\nouter radii, which makes the median metallicity higher at the outer radii.\nCombining this result with the recently observed age-metallicity and\nage-velocity dispersion relation for the Milky Way thick disk stars suggested\nby Haywood et al. (2013), we argue that the observed (small) positive radial\nmetallicity gradient at large heights of the Milky Way disk stars can be\nexplained by the flaring of the younger thick and/or thin disk stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Aug 2013 09:29:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 May 2014 08:53:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

These cooling sequences are appropriate for the study of very old\nstellar populations. The results presented here are the product of\nself-consistent, fully evolutionary calculations. Specifically, we follow the\nevolution of white dwarf progenitors from the zero-age main sequence through\nall the evolutionary phases, namely the core hydrogen-burning phase, the\nhelium-burning phase, and the thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch phase\nto the white dwarf stage. This is done for the most relevant range of main\nsequence masses, covering the most usual interval of white dwarf masses ---\nfrom $0.53\\, M_{\\sun}$ to $0.83\\, M_{\\sun}$. Due to the low metallicity of the\nprogenitor stars, white dwarfs are born with thicker hydrogen envelopes,\nleading to more intense hydrogen burning shells as compared with their solar\nmetallicity counterparts. We study the phase in which nuclear reactions are\nstill important and find that nuclear energy sources play a key role during\nlong periods of time, considerably increasing the cooling times from those\npredicted by standard white dwarf models. In particular, we find that for this\nmetallicity and for white dwarf masses smaller than about $0.6\\, M_{\\sun}$,\nnuclear reactions are the main contributor to the stellar luminosity for\nluminosities as low as $\\log(L/L_{\\sun})\\simeq -3.2$.

The circumstellar environments of these stars reveal their\nmass-loss history, identifying clues to both their individual evolutionary\nstatus and the connection between objects of different phases. Here we present\na survey of 25 such evolved massive stars (16 B[e]SGs, 6 LBVs, 2 YHGs, and 1\nPeculiar Oe star), observed in the K-band with the Spectrograph for INtegral\nField Observation in the Near-Infrared (SINFONI; R = 4500) on the ESO VLT UT4 8\nm telescope. The sample can be split into two categories based on spectral\nmorphology: one group includes all of the B[e]SGs, the Peculiar Oe star, and\ntwo of the LBVs, while the other includes the YHGs and the rest of the LBVs.\nThe difference in LBV spectral appearance is due to some objects being in a\nquiescent phase and some objects being in an active or outburst phase. CO\nemission features are found in 13 of our targets, with first time detections\nfor MWC 137, LHA 120-S 35, and LHA 115-S 65. From model fits to the CO band\nheads, the emitting regions appear to be detached from the stellar surface.\nEach star with ^12CO features also shows ^13CO emission, signaling an evolved\nnature. Based on the level of ^13C enrichment, we conclude that many of the\nB[e]SGs are likely in a pre-Red Supergiant phase of their evolution. There\nappears to be a lower luminosity limit of log L/L_solar = 5.0 below which CO is\nnot detected. The lack of CO features in several high luminosity B[e]SGs and\nvariability in others suggests that they may in fact be LBV candidates,\nstrengthening the connection between these two very similar transition phases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Aug 2013 12:14:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

We observed one transit with Wide Field\nCamera 3 using the G141 low-resolution grism to cover the wavelength range\n1.087- 1.678 {\\mu}m. These time series observations were taken with the newly\navailable spatial scan mode that increases the duty cycle by nearly a factor of\ntwo, thus improving the resulting photometric precision of the data. We measure\na planet-to-star radius ratio of Rp/R*=0.11709+/-0.00038 in the white light\ncurve with the centre of transit occurring at 2456114.345+/-0.000133 (JD).

We compute the\ntransmission spectrum using both single target and differential photometry with\nsimilar results. The resultant transmission spectrum shows a significant\nabsorption above the 5-{\\sigma} level matching the 1.4{\\mu}m water absorption\nband. In solar composition models, the water absorption is sensitive to the ~1\nmbar pressure levels at the terminator. The detected absorption agrees with\nthat predicted by an 1000 K isothermal model, as well as with that predicted by\na planetary-averaged temperature model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Aug 2013 12:32:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-18"}

Computational prediction of CpG\nsite-specific methylation levels is important, but current approaches tackle\naverage methylation within a genomic locus and are often limited to specific\ngenomic regions. Results: We characterize genome-wide DNA methylation patterns,\nand show that correlation among CpG sites decays rapidly, making predictions\nsolely based on neighboring sites challenging. We built a random forest\nclassifier to predict CpG site methylation levels using as features neighboring\nCpG site methylation levels and genomic distance, and co-localization with\ncoding regions, CGIs, and regulatory elements from the ENCODE project, among\nothers. Our approach achieves 91% -- 94% prediction accuracy of genome-wide\nmethylation levels at single CpG site precision. The accuracy increases to 98%\nwhen restricted to CpG sites within CGIs. Our classifier outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methylation classifiers and identifies features that\ncontribute to prediction accuracy: neighboring CpG site methylation status, CpG\nisland status, co-localized DNase I hypersensitive sites, and specific\ntranscription factor binding sites were found to be most predictive of\nmethylation levels. Conclusions: Our observations of DNA methylation patterns\nled us to develop a classifier to predict site-specific methylation levels that\nachieves the best DNA methylation predictive accuracy to date.

While the\npopulation genetics of compensatory substitution have received considerable\nattention, most studies have focused on the case when natural selection is very\nstrong against deleterious intermediates. In the biologically-plausible\nscenario of weak to moderate selection there exist two alternate pathways for\ncompensatory substitution. In one pathway, a deleterious mutation becomes fixed\nprior to occurrence of the compensatory mutation. In the other, the two loci\nare simultaneously polymorphic. The rates of compensatory substitution along\nthese two pathways and their relative probabilities are functions of the\npopulation size, selection strength, mutation rate, and recombination rate. In\nthis paper these rates and path probabilities are derived analytically and\nverified using population genetic simulations. The expected time durations of\nthese two paths are similar when selection is moderate, but not when selection\nis weak. The effect of recombination on the dynamics of the substitution\nprocess are explored using simulation.

A syntax framework provides a\nbasis for integrating reasoning about the syntax of the expressions with\nreasoning about what the expressions mean.

We prove theoretical bounds on accuracy, memory access\ncost, and parallel runtime complexity, as well as showing empirically that the\nalgorithm yields accurate results and substantial speedups compared to an\noptimized sequential implementation.\n  (This is an expanded version of a CIKM'13 paper of the same title.)\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Aug 2013 15:54:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-12"}

This method solved the problems of innerspring\nmattresses that cannot allow body-contouring uniform support, and foam\nmattresses that cannot provide everybody equal comfort from the same mattress.\nBy the buried pressure sensor array and actuator array in foam layer of a\nmattress, both are connected to a controller to generate the pressure\ndistribution mapping of a human body on the mattress, then from the data of\nthis mapping, some of the actuators are driven up or down by the controller to\ngenerate a body-contouring uniform support. By the aid of mathematical\nmorphology algorithms, user can also choose a different support mode by another\nwireless controller with touch-screen to accommodate personal favorite firmness\nof the mattress and to take his tensed mood and pressure off with good sleep\nuntil daylight. Moreover, some other homecare functions, such as temperature\nmeasurement, sleep on posture correction and fall down prevention, can approach\nby additional hardware and software as user requirement in the future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Aug 2013 17:31:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-12"}

The suboptimal rate\nreachable by our optomechanical protocol is high enough to outperform the\nclassical capacity of the noiseless quantum channel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Aug 2013 15:46:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-08"}
