We consider in particular the\nSU (N) case and show that in the pure gauge case the ghost propagator is\nenhanced, while the gluon propagator is suppressed in this limit, therefore the\nstudy of the Gribov ambiguity may shed some light on the mass gap problem and\non colour confinement.

Theories explored include a D-brane inspired\nconstruct of U(3) X Sp(1) X U(1) X U(1) extension of the standard model, in\nwhich we demonstrate several possible observables that may be detected at the\nLHC, and an ability to stabilize the Higgs mechanism. The extended model can\nalso explain recent Planck data which, when added to HST data gives an excess\nof relativistic degrees of freedom of \\Delta N = 0.574 +- 0.25 above the\nstandard result. Also explored is a possible non-thermal dark matter model for\nexplanation of this result. Recent observations of Fermi bubble results\nindicate a signal of a 50 GeV dark matter particle annihilating into b b-bar,\nwith a thermally averaged annihilation cross section corresponding to < \\sigma\nv> = 8 X 10^(-27) cm^3/s, spurs interest in a Higgs portal model suggested by\nSteven Weinberg.

In this\ninvestigation, the results from eleven participants, each using a different\ncombination of photometric redshift code, template spectral energy\ndistributions (SEDs) and priors, are used to examine the properties of\nphotometric redshifts applied to deep fields with broad-band multi-wavelength\ncoverage.

Comparing the results, we find that there is\nno particular code or set of template SEDs that results in significantly better\nphotometric redshifts compared to others. However, we find codes producing the\nlowest scatter and outlier fraction utilize a training sample to optimize\nphotometric redshifts by adding zero-point offsets, template adjusting or\nadding extra smoothing errors. These results therefore stress the importance of\nthe training procedure. We find a strong dependence of the photometric redshift\naccuracy on the signal-to-noise ratio of the photometry. On the other hand, we\nfind a weak dependence of the photometric redshift scatter with redshift and\ngalaxy color. We find that most photometric redshift codes quote redshift\nerrors (e.g., 68% confidence intervals) that are too small compared to that\nexpected from the spectroscopic control sample. We find that all codes show a\nstatistically significant bias in the photometric redshifts. However, the bias\nis in all cases smaller than the scatter, the latter therefore dominates the\nerrors.

The adaptive agents with crowding perception are constructed to\ninvestigate complex, selforganized collective dynamics of pedestrian motion.\nThe proposed model simulates selforganized pedestrian flows in good\nquantitative agreement with empirical data. The selforganized phenomena include\nlane formation in bidirectional flow and fundamental diagrams of unidirectional\nflow. Simulation results show that the emergence of lane formation in\nbidirectional flow can be well reproduced. To investigate this further,\nincreasing view distance has a significant effect on reducing the number of\nlanes, increasing lane width, and stabilizing the self-organized lanes. The\npaper also discusses phase transitions of fundamental diagrams of pedestrian\ncrowds with unidirectional flow. It is found that the heterogeneity of how\npedestrians perceive crowding in the population has a remarkable impact on the\nflow quality, which results in the buildup of congestion and rapidly decreases\nthe efficiency of pedestrian flows. It also indicates that the concept of\nheterogeneity may be used to explain the instability of phase transitions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Aug 2013 06:28:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 8 Nov 2013 14:01:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 10 Apr 2014 06:11:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-11"}

These regions included the left rostral anterior\ncingulate cortex (rACC), bilateral dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC),\nbilateral superior frontal gyrus (SFG), and right medial frontopolar cortex\n(MFPC).

The SVAR analysis demonstrates that the left\nrACC plays an important role during the rtfMRI-nf training, modulating the LA\nand the other network regions. According to the analysis, the rtfMRI-nf\ntraining leads to a significant enhancement in the time-lagged effect of the\nleft rACC on the LA.

The infrared\nexcess detected with \\emph{Spitzer} and the lines of heavy elements observed in\ntheir atmospheres with high-resolution spectroscopy converge on the idea that\nplanetary material accretes onto these stars. Accretion rates have been derived\nby several authors with the assumption of a steady state between accretion and\ngravitational settling. The results are unrealistically different for DA and DB\nwhite dwarfs. When heavy matter is accreted onto stars, it induces an inverse\n$\\mu$-gradient that leads to fingering (thermohaline) convection. The aim of\nthis letter is to study the impact of this specific process on the derived\naccretion rates in white dwarfs and on the difference between DA and DB. We\nsolve the diffusion equation for the accreted heavy elements with a\ntime-dependent method. The models we use have been obtained both with the IRAP\ncode, which computes static models, and the La Plata code, which computes\nevolutionary sequences. Computations with pure gravitational settling are\ncompared with computations that include fingering convection. The most\nimportant result is that fingering convection has very important effects on DAs\nbut is inefficient in DBs. When only gravitational settling is taken into\naccount, the time-dependent computations lead to a steady state, as postulated\nby previous authors. When fingering convection is added, this steady state\noccurs much later. The surprising difference found in the past for the\naccretion rates derived for DA and DB white dwarfs disappears. The derived\naccretion rates for DAs are increased when fingering convection is taken into\naccount, whereas those for DBs are not modified. More precise and developed\nresults will be given in a forthcoming paper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Aug 2013 14:03:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Sep 2013 09:14:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

This model is implemented\nin the FLUKA Monte Carlo simulations package for protons, neutrons and pions.\nWe compare simulation results of NIEL and DPA for diamond and silicon material\nexposed to protons, neutrons and pions for a wide range of energies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Aug 2013 15:59:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

Cundin","title":"Reliability, calibration and metrology in ionizing radiation dosimetry","comments":"63 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables","journal-ref":null,"doi":null,"report-no":null,"categories":"physics.med-ph","license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","abstract":"  Radiation dosimetry systems are complex systems, comprised of a milieu of\ncomponents, designed for determining absorbed dose after exposure to ionizing\nradiation. Although many materials serve as absorbing media for measurement,\nthermoluminescent dosimeters represent some of the more desirable materials\navailable; yet, reliability studies have revealed a clear and definite\ndecrement in dosimeter sensitivity after repeated use. Unfortunately, repeated\nuse of any such material for absorbing media in ionizing radiation dosimetry\nwill in time experience performance decrements; thus, in order to achieve the\nmost accuracy and/or precision in dosimetry, it is imperative proper\ncompensation be made in calibration. Yet, analysis proves the majority of the\nmeasured decrement in sensitivity experienced by dosimeters is attributable to\ndrift noise and not to any degradation in dosimeter performance, at least, not\nto any great degree. In addition to investigating dosimeter reliability,\nimplications for metrological traceability and influences for calibration, this\nmonograph addresses certain errors in applied statistics, which are rather\nalarming habits found in common usage throughout the radiation dosimetry\ncommunity. This monograph can also be considered a systems analysis of sorts;\nbecause, attention to such key topics, so general and essential in nature,\nproduces an effective system analysis, where each principle covered aptly\napplies to radiation dosimetry systems in general.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Aug 2013 21:15:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-12"}
