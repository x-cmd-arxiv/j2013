As discussed in the previous paper, the morphologies of the 4.5\n{\\mu}m emission generally resemble those of the near-infrared continuum, but\nare different from those of the H2 emission. Of our sample, only 28% of EGOs\nwith H2 emission show similar morphologies between 4.5 {\\mu}m and H2 emission.\nThese results suggest that the 4.5 {\\mu}m emission mainly comes from scattered\ncontinuum from the embedded young stellar object (YSO), and partially from H2\nemission. About half of EGOs are associated with H2 outflows, if the H2 outflow\nincompleteness is considered. The H2 outflow detection rate for EGOs with\nK-band detections (61%) is significantly higher than for those without K-band\ndetections (36%). This difference may be due to the fact that both H2 and\nK-band emissions are associated with outflows, i.e., H2 emission and K-band\ncontinuum are associated with shocks and outflow cavities, respectively. We\nalso compared the correlation between the H2 outflows and Class I 44 GHz\nmethanol masers from literature. The methanol masers can be located upstream or\ndownstream of the H2 outflows and some bright H2 spots or outflows are not\nassociated with methanol masers, suggesting that methanol masers and H2\nemission trace different excitation conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Aug 2013 16:02:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

Whereas new emerging active regions\ncaused changes in the large-scale coronal field, the coronal fields of the 14\ndecaying active regions only opened under the condition that the global coronal\nstructure remained almost unchanged. This was because the dominant\nslowly-varying, low-order multipoles prevented opposing-polarity fields from\nopening and the remnant active-region flux preserved the regions' low-order\nmultipole moments long after the regions had decayed. Thus the polarity of each\ncoronal hole necessarily matched the polar field on the side of the streamer\nbelt where the corresponding active region decayed.

Here we investigate the\nLuminosity Function (LF) methodology, and how its estimates would be affected\nby a change on the cosmological model assumed in its computation. Are the\ncurrent observational constraints on the allowed Cosmology enough to yield\nrobust LF results? We use the far-infrared source catalogues built on the\nobservations performed with the Herschel/PACS instrument, and selected as part\nof the PACS evolutionary probe (PEP) survey. Schechter profiles are obtained in\nredshift bins up to z approximately 4, assuming comoving volumes in both the\nstandard model, that is, Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker metric with a\nperfect fluid energy-momentum tensor, and non-homogeneous LTB dust models,\nparametrized to fit the current combination of results stemming from the\nobservations of supernovae Ia, the cosmic microwave background, and baryonic\nacoustic oscillations. We find that the luminosity functions computed assuming\nboth the standard model and LTB void models show in general good agreement.\nHowever, the faint-end slope in the void models shows a significant departure\nfrom the standard model up to redshift 0.4. We demonstrate that this result is\nnot artificially caused by the used LF estimator which turns out to be robust\nunder the differences in matter-energy density profiles of the models. The\ndifferences found in the LF slopes at the faint end are due to variation in the\nluminosities of the sources, which depend on the geometrical part of the model.\nIt follows that either the standard model is over-estimating the number density\nof faint sources or the void models are under-estimating it.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Aug 2013 18:03:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-18"}

Observations before and after the\nevent show that the apparent impact parameter of the event was\n$0.019\\pm0.004$\", corresponding to a close approach of $580\\pm120$ km to the\ncentre of Quaoar. No signatures of occultation by either Quaoar's limb or its\npotential atmosphere are detectable in the relative photometry of Quaoar and\nthe target star, which were unresolved during closest approach. From this\nphotometry we are able to put constraints on any potential atmosphere Quaoar\nmight have. Using a Markov chain Monte Carlo and likelihood approach, we place\npressure upper limits on sublimation supported, isothermal atmospheres of pure\nN$_2$, CO, and CH$_4$. For N$_2$ and CO, the upper limit surface pressures are\n1 and 0.7 $\\mu{bar}$ respectively. The surface temperature required for such\nlow sublimation pressures is $\\sim33$ K, much lower than Quaoar's mean\ntemperature of $\\sim44$ K measured by others.

In\nthis paper, we introduce a simple test particle method to fit stream data,\nusing a Markov Chain Monte Carlo technique to marginalise over uncertainties in\nthe progenitor's orbit and the Milky Way halo shape parameters. Applying it to\nmock data of thin streams in the MW halo, we show that, even for very cold\nstreams, stream-orbit offsets - not modelled in our simple method - introduce\nsystematic biases in the recovered shape parameters. For the streams that we\nconsider, and our particular choice of potential parameterisation, these errors\nare of order ~20% on the halo flattening parameters. However, larger systematic\nerrors can arise for more general streams and potentials; such offsets need to\nbe correctly modelled in order to obtain an unbiased recovery of the underlying\npotential.\n  Assessing which of the known Milky Way streams are most constraining, we find\nNGC 5466 and Pal 5 are the most promising candidates. These form an interesting\npair as their orbital planes are both approximately perpendicular to each other\nand to the disc, giving optimal constraints on the MW halo shape.

The reason is that the lightest scalar in such theories is heavier than\nthe lightest pseudo-scalar with the mass difference being fixed by the scale of\nthe theory. LHC searches suggest that the scale of any new physics, including\nthat of a putative new theory dynamically generating the 125 GeV \"Higgs\"\nparticle, is relatively high $\\sim{(1/2TeV-1TeV)}$. Also the LHC analysis\nsuggests that it is {\\it scalar} namely $J^P = 0^+$ rather than pseudo-scalar.\nThus it is unlikely that the \"Higgs\" could arise as a composite in such\ntheories- though it will arise in special cases when the underlying binding\ngauge group is real as a fermion-fermion bound state.\n  The direct considerations of the various two point functions in the large\n$N_c$ limit presented below- suggest that massless pseudo-scalars, but not any\nother anomalously light meson, arise as composites of massless fermions say the\nmassless u and $\\bar{d}$ quarks in QCD. These massless pions manifest the\nspontaneous breaking of the global axial symmetry in QCD with the pions being\n(pseudo) Nambu Goldstone Bosons. This offers a different insight into SXSB in\nQCD and most other confining non-abelian gauge vectorial gauge theory.\nSpecifically we consider the euclidean two point functions $F_I|x-y|$ for\nasymptotic $|x-y|$ expressed as a sum over fermionic paths. We conjecture that\nfor the pseudo-scalar two point function - and for that case only- self\nretracing paths and closely related paths make in this limit a positive,\ncoherent and dominant contribution, a contribution which evades the generic\nasymptotic exponential fall-off and allows the lightest pseudoscalars to be\nmassless.

The error bar arising just from the \"fitting\" of\nZAHBs and isochrones is ~ +/- 0.25 Gyr, while that associated with distance and\nchemical abundance uncertainties is ~ +/- 1.5-2 Gyr.

The\nobserved dependence of pupal transpiration on time is attributed to an\nalternation between two, essential modes, for which the deposition of a thin,\npupal skin inside the puparium and its subsequent demise are thought to be\nresponsible. For each mode of transpiration, the results of the Bursell (1958)\ninvestigation into pupal dehydration are used as a rudimentary data set. These\ndata are generalised to all temperatures and humidities by invoking the\nproperty of multiplicative separability. The problem, then, is that as the\ntemperature varies with time, so does the metabolism and the developmental\nstages to which the model data pertain, must necessarily warp. The\npuparial-duration formula of Phelps and Burrows (1969) and Hargrove (2004) is\nexploited to facilitate a mapping between the constant-temperature time domain\nof the data and that of some, more general case at hand. The resulting,\nGlossina morsitans model is extrapolated to other species using their relative\nsurface areas, their relative protected and unprotected transpiration rates and\ntheir different fourth instar excretions (drawing, to a lesser extent, from the\ndata of Buxton and Lewis, 1934). In this way the problem of pupal dehydration\nis formulated as a series of integrals and the consequent survival can be\npredicted. The discovery of a distinct definition for hygrophilic species,\nwithin the formulation, prompts the investigation of the hypothetical effect of\na two-day heat wave on pupae. This leads to the conclusion that the\nclassification of species as hygrophilic, mesophilic and xerophilic is largely\ntrue only in so much as their third and fourth instars are and, possibly, the\nhours shortly before eclosion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Aug 2013 05:14:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 9 May 2014 19:11:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 19 May 2015 14:59:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

The fiducial model from a global analysis including constraints\nfrom isochrones indicates that the V=10.38 host star (BD+31 2447) is a mildly\nevolved, late-F star with T_eff=6102 \\pm 43 K, log(g_*)=4.07_{-0.07}^{+0.04}\nand [Fe/H]=-0.28 \\pm 0.04, with an inferred mass M_*=1.09 \\pm 0.04 M_sun and\nradius R_star=1.58_{-0.09}^{+0.16} R_sun.

For ergodic sources, it was shown that\nGLS-coding achieves the best possible lossless compression (in the noiseless\nsetting) bounded by Shannon entropy.

Even a 1-bit error in the initial value will throw it outside the Cantor\nset which can be detected while decoding.

An\nextra advantage of BBO lies in its ability to serve an interface between the\nTSSs and the superconductor for the realization of Majorana Fermions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Aug 2013 11:55:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-03"}

The null electrovacuum conditions are counterparts\nof the Rainich conditions, which geometrically characterize non-null\nelectrovacua. Given a spacetime satisfying the conditions for a null\nelectrovacuum, a straightforward procedure builds the null electromagnetic\nfield from the metric. Null electrovacuum geometry is illustrated using some\npure radiation spacetimes taken from the literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Aug 2013 14:41:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 4 Jan 2014 15:54:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

The problem of\nminimizing CVaR is theoretically known to be of Neyman-Pearson type binary\nsolution. We add a constraint on expected return to investigate the Mean-CVaR\nportfolio selection problem in a dynamic setting: the investor is faced with a\nMarkowitz type of risk reward problem at final horizon where variance as a\nmeasure of risk is replaced by CVaR. Based on the complete market assumption,\nwe give an analytical solution in general. The novelty of our solution is that\nit is no longer Neyman-Pearson type where the final optimal portfolio takes\nonly two values. Instead, in the case where the portfolio value is required to\nbe bounded from above, the optimal solution takes three values; while in the\ncase where there is no upper bound, the optimal investment portfolio does not\nexist, though a three-level portfolio still provides a sub-optimal solution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Aug 2013 15:37:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-19"}

This method has been used\non large telescopes with large and expensive instrumentation, only enabling a\nsmall amount of observing time per star. We have developed a compact\nspectrograph fed by one or several single-mode fibres that avoids the need for\ncomplex fibre scrambling or gas absorption cells for calibration. In principle,\nthis will enable planet searches around bright stars over the next few years.\nWe aim to pave the way for large networks of small telescopes searching for\nEarth-like planets.

The\nnumber of of holes is $h=1 + (|C_4|-|C_2|)/4$ where $C_4$ and $C_2$ are sets of\ninward and outward corner points, respectively.\n  This paper mainly deals with algorithm design and implementation of practical\ncomputation of topological invariants in digital space. The algorithms relating\nto data structures, and pathological case detection and original data\nmodification are main issues.\n  This paper designed fast algorithms for topological invariants such as\nconnected components, hole counting in 2D and boundary surface genus for 3D.\nFor 2D images, we designed a linear time algorithm to solve hole counting\nproblem. In 3D, we designed also O(n) time algorithm to get genus of the closed\nsurface.
