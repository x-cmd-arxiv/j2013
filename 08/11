This kind\nof Noether symmetry is a subclass of a more general family of symmetries,\ncalled Noether Gauge Symmetries (NGS). Motivated by this mathematical tool, in\nthis article, we discuss the generalized Noether symmetry of Quintom model of\ndark energy, which is a two component fluid model of quintessence and phantom\nfields. Our model is a generalization of the Noether symmetries of a single and\nmultiple components which have been investigated in detail before. We found the\ngeneral form of the quintom potential in which the whole dynamical system has a\npoint like symmetry. We investigated different possible solutions of the system\nfor diverse family of gauge function. Specially, we discovered two family of\npotentials, one corresponds to a free quintessence (phantom) and the second is\nin the form of quadratic interaction between two components. These two families\nof potential functions are proposed from the symmetry point of view, but in the\nquintom models they are used as phenomenological models without clear\nmathematical justification. From integrability point of view, we found two\nforms of the scale factor: one is power law and second is de-Sitter. Some\ncosmological implications of the solutions have been investigated\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Aug 2013 08:30:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-08"}

This requires evaluating a regularized sum over one loop vacuum\nenergies of an infinite set of massless higher spin gauge fields in Euclidean\nAdS4. For the Vasiliev theory including fields of all integer spin and a scalar\nwith Delta=1 boundary condition, we show that the regularized sum vanishes.\nThis is in perfect agreement with the vanishing of subleading corrections to F\nin the U(N) singlet sector of the theory of N free complex scalar fields. For\nthe minimal Vasiliev theory including fields of only even spin, the regularized\nsum remarkably equals the value of F for one free real scalar field. This\nresult may agree with the O(N) singlet sector of the theory of N real scalar\nfields, provided the coupling constant in the Vasiliev theory is identified as\nG_N ~ 1/(N-1).

Many of the most important problems (such as Goldbach's conjecture and\nFermat's Last theorem) can be formulated in terms of the sumset $S + S = \\{x+y\n: x,y\\in S\\}$ of a set of integers $S$. A finite set of integers $A$ is\nsum-dominated if $|A+A| > |A-A|$. Though it was believed that the percentage of\nsubsets of $\\{0,...,n\\}$ that are sum-dominated tends to zero, in 2006 Martin\nand O'Bryant proved a very small positive percentage are sum-dominated if the\nsets are chosen uniformly at random (through work of Zhao we know this\npercentage is approximately $4.5 \\cdot 10^{-4}$). While most sets are\ndifference-dominated in the integer case, this is not the case when we take\nsubsets of many finite groups. We show that if we take subsets of larger and\nlarger finite groups uniformly at random, then not only does the probability of\na set being sum-dominated tend to zero but the probability that $|A+A|=|A-A|$\ntends to one, and hence a typical set is balanced in this case. The cause of\nthis marked difference in behavior is that subsets of $\\{0,..., n\\}$ have a\nfringe, whereas finite groups do not. We end with a detailed analysis of\ndihedral groups, where the results are in striking contrast to what occurs for\nsubsets of integers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Aug 2013 21:46:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 19 Jan 2014 05:51:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-21"}

However, given\nthe limitations on the size of tweets, it is hard to extract measures for\nranking from the tweets' content alone. We present a novel ranking method,\ncalled RAProp, which combines two orthogonal measures of relevance and\ntrustworthiness of a tweet. The first, called Feature Score, measures the\ntrustworthiness of the source of the tweet. This is done by extracting features\nfrom a 3-layer twitter ecosystem, consisting of users, tweets and the pages\nreferred to in the tweets. The second measure, called agreement analysis,\nestimates the trustworthiness of the content of the tweet, by analyzing how and\nwhether the content is independently corroborated by other tweets. We view the\ncandidate result set of tweets as the vertices of a graph, with the edges\nmeasuring the estimated agreement between each pair of tweets. The feature\nscore is propagated over this agreement graph to compute the top-k tweets that\nhave both trustworthy sources and independent corroboration.

The method is based on an adaptive gradient\ndescent algorithm that directly determines the time delay and magnitudes of two\nnoisy sinusoidal signals. The new estimator uses a novel quadrature carrier\ngenerator to produce the carriers for an adaptive quadrature phase detector,\nwhich in turn uses an arc tan function to compute the time delay. The proposed\nmethod is quite robust and can adapt to significant variation in input signal\ncharacteristics like magnitude and frequency imposing no requirement on the\nmagnitudes of the two signals.

Here we report on complex, open structures\norganized via interactions with defects in the bulk. Specifically, by confining\nthe nematic liquid crystal in an array of microposts with homeotropic anchoring\nconditions, we cause defect rings to form at well-defined locations in the bulk\nof the sample. These defects source elastic deformations that direct the\nassembly of the interfacially-trapped colloids into ring-like assemblies, which\nrecapitulate the defect geometry even when the microposts are completely\nimmersed in the nematic. When the surface density of the colloids is high, they\nform a ring near the defect and a hexagonal lattice far from it. Since\ntopographically complex substrates are easily fabricated and liquid crystal\ndefects are readily reconfigured, this work lays the foundation for a new,\nrobust mechanism to dynamically direct assembly over large areas by controlling\nsurface anchoring and associated bulk defect structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Aug 2013 15:57:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 Sep 2013 23:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}
