Some\ndecision procedures for these logics are known; they use tree automata,\ntableaux or axiom systems. In this paper we present a uniform game-theoretic\nframework for the satisfiability problem of these branching-time temporal\nlogics. We define satisfiability games for the full branching-time temporal\nlogic CTL* using a high-level definition of winning condition that captures the\nessence of well-foundedness of least fixpoint unfoldings. These winning\nconditions form formal languages of \\omega-words. We analyse which kinds of\ndeterministic {\\omega}-automata are needed in which case in order to recognise\nthese languages. We then obtain a reduction to the problem of solving parity or\nB\\\"uchi games. The worst-case complexity of the obtained algorithms matches the\nknown lower bounds for these logics. This approach provides a uniform, yet\ncomplexity-theoretically optimal treatment of satisfiability for branching-time\ntemporal logics. It separates the use of temporal logic machinery from the use\nof automata thus preserving a syntactical relationship between the input\nformula and the object that represents satisfiability, i.e. a winning strategy\nin a parity or B\\\"uchi game. The games presented here work on a Fischer-Ladner\nclosure of the input formula only.

In conjunction with the halo occupation approach, this method\nprovides a basis for the rapid generation of mock galaxy samples spanning a\nwide range of cosmological parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Aug 2013 17:16:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 21 Feb 2014 15:56:04 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 1 Dec 2014 17:57:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-02"}

Their overpressurised H II regions\nimpart kinetic energy and momentum to the ISM, compress and/or evaporate dense\nclouds, and can constrain properties of both the star and the ISM. Here we\npresent one-, two-, and (the first) three-dimensional simulations of the H II\nregion around a massive star moving supersonically through a uniform,\nmagnetised ISM, with properties appropriate for the nearby O star Zeta Oph. The\nH II region leaves an expanding overdense shell behind the star and, inside\nthis, an underdense wake that should be filled with hot gas from the shocked\nstellar wind. The gas column density in the shell is strongly influenced by the\nISM magnetic field strength and orientation. H-alpha emission maps show the H\nII region remains roughly circular, although the star is displaced somewhat\nfrom the centre of emission. For our model parameters, the kinetic energy\nfeedback from the H II region is comparable to the mechanical luminosity of the\nstellar wind, and the momentum feedback rate is >100X larger than that from the\nwind and about 10X larger than the total momentum input rate available from\nradiation pressure. Compared to the star's eventual supernova explosion, the\nkinetic energy feedback from the H II region over the star's main sequence\nlifetime is >100X less, but the momentum feedback is up to 4X larger.

We\nillustrate numerically that, depending on the structural features, the\nadmissible cycles are respectively stored and retrieved as attracting limit\ncycles, unstable periodic solutions and delay-induced long-lasting transient\noscillations, and the transition from fixed points to the attracting limit\ncycle bifurcating from the trivial solution takes place through multiple\nsaddle-nodes on limit cycle bifurcations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Aug 2013 18:38:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 Oct 2013 05:54:52 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 9 Dec 2013 10:58:36 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 8 Jan 2014 19:01:35 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 21 Aug 2014 05:46:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-22"}

Cognitive users first\ndetermine the activity of the primary users' through channel sensing and then\ninitiate data transmission at a power level that depends on the channel sensing\ndecisions. It is assumed that finite blocklength codes are employed in the data\ntransmission phase. Hence, errors can occur in reception and retransmissions\ncan be required. Primary users' activities are modeled as a two-state Markov\nchain and an eight-state Markov chain is constructed in order to model the\ncognitive radio channel. Channel state information (CSI) is assumed to be\nperfectly known by either the secondary receiver only or both the secondary\ntransmitter and receiver. In the absence of CSI at the transmitter, fixed-rate\ntransmission is performed whereas under perfect CSI knowledge, for a given\ntarget error probability, the transmitter varies the rate according to the\nchannel conditions. Under these assumptions, throughput in the presence of\nbuffer constraints is determined by characterizing the maximum constant arrival\nrates that can be supported by the cognitive radio channel while satisfying\ncertain limits on buffer violation probabilities. Tradeoffs between throughput,\nbuffer constraints, coding blocklength, and sensing duration for both\nfixed-rate and variable-rate transmissions are analyzed numerically. The\nrelations between average error probability, sensing threshold and sensing\nduration are studied in the case of variable-rate transmissions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Aug 2013 18:38:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-26"}

This result is achieved through a new method for\nmeasuring the product of the jet Lorentz factor and the intrinsic opening angle\nGamma*theta_j from measured apparent opening angles in flux density limited\nsamples of AGN jets. The Gamma*theta_j parameter is important for jet physics\nbecause it is related to the jet-frame sidewise expansion speed and causal\nconnection between the jet edges and its symmetry axis.

These images span the\nentire electromagnetic spectrum from radio waves to infrared light to X-rays\nand gamma rays, a majority of which is undetectable to the human eye without\ntechnology. Once these data are collected, one or more specialists must process\nthe data to create an image. Therefore, the creation of astronomical imagery\ninvolves a series of choices. How do these choices affect the comprehension of\nthe science behind the images? What is the best way to represent data to a\nnon-expert? Should these choices be based on aesthetics, scientific veracity,\nor is it possible to satisfy both? This paper reviews just one choice out of\nthe many made by astronomical image processors: color. The choice of color is\none of the most fundamental when creating an image taken with modern\ntelescopes. We briefly explore the concept of the image as translation,\nparticularly in the case of astronomical images from invisible portions of the\nelectromagnetic spectrum. After placing modern astronomical imagery and\nphotography in general in the context of its historical beginnings, we review\nthe standards (or lack thereof) in making the basic choice of color. We discuss\nthe possible implications for selecting one color palette over another in the\ncontext of the appropriateness of using these images as science communication\nproducts with a specific focus on how the non-expert perceives these images and\nhow that affects their trust in science. Finally, we share new data sets that\nbegin to look at these issues in scholarly research and discuss the need for a\nmore robust examination of this and other related topics in the future to\nbetter understand the implications for science communications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Aug 2013 20:16:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-27"}

For the conservative\npart of the motion, we obtain the two-body Lagrangian and conserved energy and\nmomentum through second post-Newtonian order. We find the contributions to\ngravitational radiation reaction to 1.5 post-Newtonian and 2.5 post-Newtonian\norders, the former corresponding to the effects of dipole gravitational\nradiation. For binary black holes we show that the motion through 2.5\npost-Newtonian order is observationally identical to that predicted by general\nrelativity.\n  In Part IV, we construct a parametrized dispersion relation that can produce\na range of predictions of alternative theories of gravity for violations of\nLorentz invariance in gravitation, and investigate their impact on the\npropagation of gravitational waves. We show how such corrections map to the\nwaveform observable by a gravitational-wave detector, and to the \"parametrized\npost-Einsteinian framework\", proposed to model a range of deviations from\nGeneral Relativity. Given a gravitational-wave detection, the lack of evidence\nfor such corrections could then be used to place a constraint on Lorentz\nviolation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Aug 2013 20:43:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-27"}

The eigenvalues of\nthe light-front QCD Hamiltonian predict the hadronic mass spectrum, and the\neigensolutions provide the light-front wavefunctions describing hadron\nstructure. The valence Fock-state wavefunctions of the light-front QCD\nHamiltonian satisfy a single-variable relativistic equation of motion,\nanalogous to the nonrelativistic radial Schrodinger equation, with an effective\nconfining potential U which systematically incorporates the effects of higher\nquark and gluon Fock states. The potential U has a unique form if one requires\nthat the action for zero quark mass remains conformally invariant. The\nholographic mapping of gravity in AdS space to QCD with a specific soft-wall\ndilaton yields the same light-front Schrodinger equation. It also gives a\nprecise relation between the bound-state amplitudes in the fifth dimension z of\nAdS space and the boost-invariant light-front wavefunctions describing the\ninternal structure of hadrons in physical space-time. The elastic and\ntransition form factors of the pion and the nucleons are found to be well\ndescribed in this framework. The predictions include a zero-mass pion in the\nchiral limit, and linear Regge trajectories with the same slope in the radial\nquantum number n and orbital angular momentum L. The light-front AdS/QCD\nholographic approach thus gives a frame-independent representation of\ncolor-confining dynamics and the excitation spectra of light-quark hadrons in\nterms of a single mass parameter.

We will prove that over\nseparated monoid schemes, any vector bundle is a coproduct of line bundles and\nthen go on to study the line bundles in more detail. Amongst other things, we\nprove that over separated monoid schemes, ${\\sf Pic}$ respects finite products.\n  Next we will introduce the notion of $s$-cancellative monoids. They are\nmonoids for which $ax=ay$ implies that $(xy)^nx=(xy)^ny, n\\in\\mathbb{N}$. This\nclass is important since it is the biggest class of monoids for which\n$M^*_{\\mathfrak{p}}$ maps injectively into its group of fractions for every\nprime ideal ${\\mathfrak{p}}$. As we will see in section 6, this will enable us\nto embed $\\mathcal{O}^*_X$ injectively in a constant sheaf provided $X$ is\nlocally $s$-cancellative. We develop the theory of $s$-divisors and we prove\nthat for an $s$-cancellative monoid scheme $X$, the group ${\\sf Pic}(X)$ can be\ndescribed in terms of $s$-divisors. For cancellative monoid schemes,\n$s$-divisors agree with the Cartier divisors.\n  We then introduce the notion of $s$-smooth monoid schemes, which generalise\nsmooth monoids schemes, and prove that for them $H^i(X,\\mathcal{O}^*_X)=0$ for\nall $i\\geq 2$. Furthermore we show that it is a local property and respects\nfinite products.\n  Finally we investigate the relationship between line bundles over a monoid\nscheme $X$ and over its geometric realisation $X_k$, where $k$ is a commutative\nring. We prove that if $k$ is an integral domain (resp. principal ideal domain)\nand $X$ is a cancellative and torsion free (resp. seminormal and torsion-free)\nmonoid scheme, then the induced map ${\\sf Pic}(X)\\to {\\sf Pic}(X_k)$ is a\nmonomorphism (resp. isomorphism).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Aug 2013 22:02:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 12 Feb 2014 23:40:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-14"}

These genes encode a primary antigen\nprotein called PfEMP1, which is expressed on the surface of infected red blood\ncells and elicits protective immune responses. Var gene sequences are\ncharacterized by pronounced mosaicism, precluding the use of traditional\nphylogenetic tools that require bifurcating tree-like evolutionary\nrelationships. We present a new method that identifies highly variable regions\n(HVRs), and then maps each HVR to a complex network in which each sequence is a\nnode and two nodes are linked if they share an exact match of significant\nlength. Here, networks of var genes that recombine freely are expected to have\na uniformly random structure, but constraints on recombination will produce\nnetwork communities that we identify using a stochastic block model. We\nvalidate this method on synthetic data, showing that it correctly recovers\npopulations of constrained recombination, before applying it to the Duffy\nBinding Like-{\\alpha} (DBL{\\alpha}) domain of var genes. We find nine HVRs\nwhose network communities map in distinctive ways to known DBL{\\alpha}\nclassifications and clinical phenotypes. We show that the recombinational\nconstraints of some HVRs are correlated, while others are independent. These\nfindings suggest that this micromodular structuring facilitates independent\nevolutionary trajectories of neighboring mosaic regions, allowing the parasite\nto retain protein function while generating enormous sequence diversity. Our\napproach therefore offers a rigorous method for analyzing evolutionary\nconstraints in var genes, and is also flexible enough to be easily applied more\ngenerally to any highly recombinant sequences.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Aug 2013 22:02:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-22"}

This paper takes a\nsignificant step towards understanding computational aspects of markets with\nproduction.\n  We first define the notion of separable, piecewise-linear concave (SPLC)\nproduction by analogy with SPLC utility functions. We then obtain a linear\ncomplementarity problem (LCP) formulation that captures exactly the set of\nequilibria for Arrow-Debreu markets with SPLC utilities and SPLC production,\nand we give a complementary pivot algorithm for finding an equilibrium. This\nsettles a question asked by Eaves in 1975 of extending his complementary pivot\nalgorithm to markets with production.\n  Since this is a path-following algorithm, we obtain a proof of membership of\nthis problem in PPAD, using Todd, 1976. We also obtain an elementary proof of\nexistence of equilibrium (i.e., without using a fixed point theorem),\nrationality, and oddness of the number of equilibria. We further give a proof\nof PPAD-hardness for this problem and also for its restriction to markets with\nlinear utilities and SPLC production. Experiments show that our algorithm runs\nfast on randomly chosen examples, and unlike previous approaches, it does not\nsuffer from issues of numerical instability. Additionally, it is strongly\npolynomial when the number of goods or the number of agents and firms is\nconstant. This extends the result of Devanur and Kannan (2008) to markets with\nproduction.\n  Finally, we show that an LCP-based approach cannot be extended to PLC\n(non-separable) production, by constructing an example which has only\nirrational equilibria.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Aug 2013 01:20:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 Sep 2013 18:28:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-24"}

Two kinds of\nsetups are analyzed, a monolayer of graphene and a two-dimensional electron gas\n(2DEG). The AFM tips set the impurity levels at the Fermi energy, where two\ncontrasting behaviors emerge: the Fano factor for the graphene diverges, while\nin the 2DEG it approaches zero. As result, the spin-degeneracy of the LDOS is\nlifted exclusively in the graphene system, in particular for the asymmetric\nregime of Fano interference. The aftermath of this limit is a counterintuitive\nphenomenon, which consists of a dominant Fano factor due to the subsurface\nimpurity even with a stronger STM-adatom coupling. Thus we find a full\npolarized conductance, achievable just by displacing vertically the position of\nthe STM tip. To the best knowledge, our work is the first to propose the Fano\neffect as the mechanism to filter spins in graphene. This feature arises from\nthe massless Dirac electrons within the band structure and allows us to employ\nthe graphene host as a relativistic Fano spin-filter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Aug 2013 03:44:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-27"}

We discuss here the stability of Fourier method\nfor nonlinear evolution problems, focusing on the two prototypical cases of the\ninviscid Burgers' equation and the multi-dimensional incompressible Euler\nequations. The Fourier method for such problems with quadratic nonlinearities\ncomes in two main flavors. One is the spectral Fourier method. The other is the\n2/3 pseudo-spectral Fourier method, where one removes the highest 1/3 portion\nof the spectrum; this is often the method of choice to maintain the balance of\nquadratic energy and avoid aliasing errors. Two main themes are discussed in\nthis paper. First, we prove that as long as the underlying exact solution has a\nminimal C^{1+\\alpha} spatial regularity, then both the spectral and the 2/3\npseudo-spectral Fourier methods are stable. Consequently, we prove their\nspectral convergence for smooth solutions of the inviscid Burgers equation and\nthe incompressible Euler equations. On the other hand, we prove that after a\ncritical time at which the underlying solution lacks sufficient smoothness,\nthen both the spectral and the 2/3 pseudo-spectral Fourier methods exhibit\nnonlinear instabilities which are realized through spurious oscillations. In\nparticular, after shock formation in inviscid Burgers' equation, the total\nvariation of bounded (pseudo-) spectral Fourier solutions must increase with\nthe number of increasing modes and we stipulate the analogous situation occurs\nwith the 3D incompressible Euler equations: the limiting Fourier solution is\nshown to enforce L^2-energy conservation, and the contrast with energy\ndissipating Onsager solutions is reflected through spurious oscillations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Aug 2013 10:38:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-27"}

In order to establish defined\nbiomacromolecular systems for mineralised tissue applications, type I collagen\nwas functionalised with 1,3-Phenylenediacetic acid (Ph) and investigated at the\nmolecular, macroscopic and functional levels. Preserved triple helix\nconformation was observed in obtained covalent networks via ATR-FTIR and WAXS,\nwhile network crosslinking degree could be adjusted based on specific reaction\nconditions. Decreased swelling ratio and increased thermo-mechanical properties\nwere observed compared to state of-the-art carbodiimide (EDC)-crosslinked\ncollagen controls, likely related to the intermolecular covalent incorporation\nof the aromatic segment.

Furthermore, FTIR, SEM and EDS revealed deposition of a\ncalcium-phosphate phase on SBF-retrieved samples, whereby an increased calcium\nphosphate ratio was observed in hydrogels with higher Ph content. 72-hour\nmaterial extracts were well tolerated by L929 mouse fibroblasts, whereby cell\nconfluence and metabolic activity (MTS assay) were comparable to those of cells\ncultured in cell culture medium (positive control).
