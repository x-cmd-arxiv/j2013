Colloidal particles, immersed in a solvent close to criticality,\nexperience long-range effective forces, named critical Casimir forces. %These\noriginate from the confinement of the solvent critical fluctuations between the\ncolloids. Building on the analogy between critical phenomena and percolation,\nwe explore the possibility of observing long-range forces near a percolation\nthreshold. To this aim we numerically evaluate the effective potential between\ntwo colloidal particles dispersed in a chemical sol and we show that it becomes\nattractive and long-ranged on approaching the sol percolation transition. We\ndevelop a theoretical description based on a polydisperse Asakura-Oosawa model\nwhich captures the divergence of the interaction range, allowing us to\ninterpret such effect in terms of depletion interactions in a structured\nsolvent. Our results provide the geometric analogue of the critical Casimir\nforce, suggesting a novel way for tuning colloidal interactions by controlling\nthe clustering properties of the solvent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Aug 2013 16:36:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Jul 2014 10:50:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-16"}

This phenomenon has not been described before. Their typical width is\nabout 0.3 arcsec and they display clear parabolic trajectories in space-time\ndiagrams. The maximum extension of the top of the jets is lowest in the umbra,\na few 100 km, and progressively longer further away from the umbra in the\npenumbra, with the longest more than 1000 km.

We present new\nsingle-epoch intermediate-resolution spectra of 17 low-redshift SNe Ia taken\nwith XShooter on the ESO Very Large Telescope. Combining this sample with\nevents from the literature, we confirm an excess (~20 per cent) of SNe Ia\ndisplaying blueshifted narrow Na I D absorption features compared to\nnon-blueshifted Na I D features. The host galaxies of SNe Ia displaying\nblueshifted absorption profiles are skewed towards later-type galaxies,\ncompared to SNe Ia that show no Na I D absorption, and SNe Ia displaying\nblueshifted narrow Na I D absorption features have broader light curves. The\nstrength of the Na I D absorption is stronger in SNe Ia displaying blueshifted\nNa I D absorption features than those without blueshifted features, and the\nstrength of the blueshifted Na I D is correlated with the B-V colour of the SN\nat maximum light.

In particular, a factorization formula for the\ncluster variables arising from a large class of mutation sequences (called\n$\\tau-$mutation sequences) is proven; this factorization also gives a recursion\non the cluster variables produced by such sequences. We can realize these\nsequences as walks in a triangular lattice using a correspondence between the\ngenerators of the affine symmetric group $\\tilde{A_2}$ and the mutations which\ngenerate $\\tau-$mutation sequences. Using this bijection, we obtain explicit\nformulae for the cluster that corresponds to a specific alcove in the lattice.\nWith this lattice visualization in mind, we then express each cluster variable\nproduced in a $\\tau$-mutation sequence as the sum of weighted perfect matchings\nof a new family of subgraphs of the dP3 brane tiling, which we call Aztec\ncastles.

We show that the presence of\nthis non-local dissipation lifts the direct link between the density of excited\natoms and the photon emission rate which is typically present when atoms decay\nindependently.

Here, we develop a stochastic\nmodel describing the emergence of a mutant pathogen and its dynamics in a\nheterogeneous host population split into various types by the management\nstrategy. Based on a multi-type Markov birth and death process, the model can\nbe used to provide a basic understanding of how the life-cycle parameters of\nthe pathogen population, and the controllable parameters of a management\nstrategy affect the speed at which a pathogen adapts to a multicomponent\ntreatment. Our results reveal the importance of coupling stochastic mutation\nand migration processes, and illustrate how their stochasticity can alter our\nview of the principles of managing pathogen adaptive dynamics at the population\nlevel.

In contrast to the accepted view, our model\nsuggests that treatment durability should not systematically be identified with\nmutation cost.

Hybridization of finite element\ndiscretizations has the main advantage, that the resulting set of algebraic\nequations has globally coupled degrees of freedom only on the skeleton of the\ncomputational mesh. Consequently, solving for these degrees of freedom involves\nthe solution of a potentially much smaller system. This not only reduces\nstorage requirements, but also allows for a faster solution with iterative\nsolvers. Using a discrete-adjoint approach, sensitivities with respect to\noutput functionals are computed to drive the adaptation. From the error\ndistribution given by the adjoint-based error estimator, h- or p-refinement is\nchosen based on the smoothness of the solution which can be quantified by\nproperly-chosen smoothness indicators. Numerical results are shown for\nsubsonic, transonic, and supersonic flow around the NACA0012 airfoil.\nhp-adaptation proves to be superior to pure h-adaptation if discontinuous or\nsingular flow features are involved.

The need to respect prescribed lower bounds on the cluster\nsizes has been observed in many scientific and business applications.\n  In this paper, we present and analyze a generalization of $k$-means that is\ncapable of handling weighted point sets and prescribed lower and upper bounds\non the cluster sizes. We call it weight-balanced $k$-means. The key difference\nto existing models lies in the ability to handle the combination of weighted\npoint sets with prescribed bounds on the cluster sizes. This imposes the need\nto perform partial membership clustering, and leads to significant differences.\n  For example, while finite termination of all $k$-means variants for\nunweighted point sets is a simple consequence of the existence of only finitely\nmany partitions of a given set of points, the situation is more involved for\nweighted point sets, as there are infinitely many partial membership\nclusterings. Using polyhedral theory, we show that the number of iterations of\nweight-balanced $k$-means is bounded above by $n^{O(dk)}$, so in particular it\nis polynomial for fixed $k$ and $d$. This is similar to the known worst-case\nupper bound for classical $k$-means for unweighted point sets and unrestricted\ncluster sizes, despite the much more general framework. We conclude with the\ndiscussion of some additional favorable properties of our method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Aug 2013 12:46:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 Aug 2016 11:57:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-04"}

We introduce a syntactic necessary and sufficient\ncondition for equivalence of queries belonging to a large natural language of\n\"explicit-wave\" combined-semantics CQ queries; this language encompasses (but\nis not limited to) all set, bag, and bag-set queries, and appears to cover all\ncombined-semantics CQ queries that are expressible in SQL. Our result solves in\nthe positive the decidability problem of determining combined-semantics\nequivalence for pairs of explicit-wave CQ queries. That is, for an arbitrary\npair of combined-semantics CQ queries, it is decidable (i) to determine whether\neach of the queries is explicit wave, and (ii) to determine, in case both\nqueries are explicit wave, whether or not they are combined-semantics\nequivalent, by using our syntactic criterion. (The problem of determining\nequivalence for general combined-semantics CQ queries remains open. Even so,\nour syntactic sufficient containment condition could still be used to determine\nthat two general CQ queries are combined-semantics equivalent.) Our equivalence\ntest, as well as our general sufficient condition for containment of\ncombined-semantics CQ queries, reduce correctly to the special cases reported\nin [2,5] for set, bag, and bag-set semantics. Our containment and equivalence\nconditions also properly generalize the results of [9], provided that the\nlatter are restricted to the language of (combined-semantics) CQ queries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Aug 2013 14:06:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Aug 2014 20:16:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-15"}

We first review these ingredients -three basic\ninequalities- and discuss their relationships with the nature of fundamental\nconstants. In particular, we argue for a covariant mass bound conjecture: in a\nspacetime free of horizon, the mass inside a surface $A$ cannot exceed $16 \\pi\nG^2 m^2< A $, while the reverse holds in a spacetime with horizons. This is\ngiven a precise definition using the formalism of light-sheets. We show that\n$\\hbar/c$ may be also given a geometrical interpretation, namely $4 \\pi\n\\hbar^2/m^2< A$. We then combine these inequalities and find/review the\nfollowing: (1) Any system must have a size greater than the Planck length, in\nthe sense that there exists a minimal area (2) We comment on the Minimal Length\nScenarios and the fate of Lorentz symmetry near the Planck scale (3) Quanta\nwith transplanckian frequencies are allowed in a large enough boxes (4) There\nexists a mass-dependent maximal acceleration given by $m c^3/\\hbar$ if $m<m_p$\nand by $c^4/G m$ if $m>m_p$ (5) There exists a mass dependent maximal force and\npower (6) There exists a maximal energy density and pressure (7) Physical\nsystems must obey the Holographic Principle (8) Holographic bounds can only be\nsaturated by systems with $m>m_p$; systems lying on the ``Compton line'' $l\n\\sim 1/m$ are fundamental objects without substructures (9) We speculate on a\nnew bound from above for the action. In passing, we note that the maximal\nacceleration is of the order of Milgrom's acceleration $a_0$ for ultra-light\nparticles ($m\\sim H_0)$ that could be associated to the Dark Energy fluid. This\nsuggests designing toy-models in which modified gravity in galaxies is driven\nby the DE field, via the maximal acceleration principle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Aug 2013 14:52:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-21"}

RMHD turbulence is driven by outward-propagating Alfv\\'en waves\n($z^+$ fluctuations) launched from the Sun, which undergo partial non-WKB\nreflection to produce sunward-propagating Alfv\\'en waves ($z^-$ fluctuations).\nWe present ten simulations with different values of the correlation time\n$\\tau_{\\rm c\\,\\sun}^+$ and perpendicular correlation length $L_{\\perp \\sun}$ of\noutward-propagating Alfv\\'en waves (AWs) at the coronal base.

We have observed that such symmetries no longer hold in planar hybrid\nstructures consisting of partly single layer graphene (SLG) and partly bilayer\ngraphene (BLG) in the quantum Hall (QH) regime. In particular, the Hall\nresistance (R12xy) across the SLG and BLG interface is observed to exhibit\nquantized plateaus that switch between those characteristic of SLG QH states\nand BLG QH states when either the sign of the charge carriers (controlled by a\nback gate) or the direction of the magnetic field is reversed. Simultaneously\nreversing both the carrier type and the magnetic field gives rise to the same\nquantized Hall resistances. The observed SLG-BLG interface QH states, with\ncharacteristic asymmetries with respect to the signs of carriers and magnetic\nfield, are determined only by the chirality of the QH edge states and can be\nexplained by a Landauer-B\\\"uttiker analysis applied to such graphene hybrid\nstructures involving two regions of different Landau level (LL) structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Aug 2013 15:37:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

In an\ninstance of this problem, a stable matching M is sought which ensures that no\nblocking pair can exist in which a resident r and hospital h can improve\nrelative to M by becoming assigned to each other. Such a situation is\nundesirable as it could naturally lead to r and h forming a private arrangement\noutside of the matching. The original HR model assumes that preference lists\nare strictly ordered. However in practice, this may be an unreasonable\nassumption: an agent may find two or more agents equally acceptable, giving\nrise to ties in its preference list. We thus obtain the Hospitals/Residents\nproblem with Ties (HRT). In such an instance, stable matchings may have\ndifferent sizes and MAX HRT, the problem of finding a maximum cardinality\nstable matching, is NP-hard. In this paper we describe an Integer Programming\n(IP) model for MAX HRT. We also provide some details on the implementation of\nthe model. Finally we present results obtained from an empirical evaluation of\nthe IP model based on real-world and randomly generated problem instances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Aug 2013 15:46:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Aug 2013 17:14:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-21"}

It is an extension of the\nlanguage of Flora-2 and so supports inheritance and other object-oriented\nfeatures, as well as the higher-order syntax of Hilog. However, Rulelog rules\nmay also contain quantifiers and may be contra-positional. In addition, these\nrules are evaluated in the presence of defeasibility mechanisms that include\nrule cancellation, rule priorities, and other aspects. Rulelog programs are\nsometimes developed by loosely coordinated teams of knowledge engineers (KEs)\nwho are not necessarily programmers. This requires not only declarative\ndebugging support, but also support for profiling to help KEs understand the\noverall structure of a computation, including its termination properties. The\ndesign of debugging and profiling tools is made more challenging because\nRulelog programs undergo a series of transformations into normal programs, so\nthat there is a cognitive distance between how rules are specified and how they\nare executed.\n  In this paper, we describe the debugging and profiling environment for\nRulelog implemented in the integrated development environment of the Silk\nsystem. Our approach includes an interface to justification graphs, which treat\nwhy-not and defeasibility as well as provenance of the rules supporting\nanswers. It also includes tools for trace-based analysis of computations to\npermit understanding of erroneous non-termination and of general performance\nissues. For semantically correct cases of the non-terminating behavior, Silk\noffers a different approach, which addresses the problem in a formally sound\nmanner by leveraging a form of bounded rationality called restraint.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Aug 2013 07:15:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-21"}
