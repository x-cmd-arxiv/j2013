We find that the current limits on the contact\ninteraction scale Lambda in the EFT apply to theories that are perturbative for\ndark matter mass m_DM < 800 GeV. However, for all values of m_DM in these\ntheories, the mediator width is larger than the mass, so that a particle-like\ninterpretation of the mediator is doubtful. Furthermore, consistency with the\nthermal relic density occurs only for 170 <m_DM < 520 GeV.

We show that structures whose first\nhyperpolarizability is near the maximum are well described by only three\nstates, the so-called three-level Ansatz, while structures with the largest\nsecond hyperpolarizability require four states. We analyze a very large set of\nconfigurations for graphs with quasi-quadratic energy spectra and show how they\nexhibit better response than bare graphs through exquisite optimization of the\nshape of the eigenfunctions enabled by the existence of the finite potentials.\nWe also discover an exception to the universal scaling properties of the\nthree-level model parameters and trace it to the observation that a greater\nnumber of levels are required to satisfy the sum rules even when the\nthree-level Ansatz is satisfied and the first hyperpolarizability is at its\nmaximum value, as specified by potential optimization. This exception in the\nuniversal scaling properties of nonlinear optical structures at the limit is\ntraced to the discontinuity in the gradient of the eigenfunctions at the\nlocation of the delta potential. This is the first time that dressed quantum\ngraphs have been devised and solved for their nonlinear response, and it is the\nfirst analytical model of a confined dynamic system with a simple potential\nenergy that achieves the fundamental limits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Aug 2013 17:09:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

Most existing\napproaches assume global consistency, i.e., the metric structure of the whole\nmanifold must not change significantly. While global isometric matching is well\nunderstood, only a few heuristic solutions are known for partial matching.\nPartial matching is particularly important for robustness to topological noise\n(incomplete data and contacts), which is a common problem in real-world 3D\nscanner data. In this paper, we introduce a new approach to partial, intrinsic\nisometric matching. Our method is based on the observation that isometries are\nfully determined by purely local information: a map of a single point and its\ntangent space fixes an isometry for both global and the partial maps. From this\nidea, we develop a new representation for partial isometric maps based on\nequivalence classes of correspondences between pairs of points and their\ntangent spaces. From this, we derive a local propagation algorithm that find\nsuch mappings efficiently. In contrast to previous heuristics based on RANSAC\nor expectation maximization, our method is based on a simple and sound\ntheoretical model and fully deterministic. We apply our approach to register\npartial point clouds and compare it to the state-of-the-art methods, where we\nobtain significant improvements over global methods for real-world data and\nstronger guarantees than previous heuristic partial matching algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Aug 2013 17:38:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Jan 2014 11:20:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-14"}

It is unclear, however, whether\ncancer stem cells originate from normal stem cells or from dedifferentiated\nprogenitor cells. To address this, we mathematically modeled the effect of\ndedifferentiation on carcinogenesis. We considered a hybrid\nstochastic-deterministic model of mutation accumulation in both stem cells and\nprogenitors, including dedifferentiation of progenitor cells to a stem\ncell-like state. We performed exact computer simulations of the emergence of\ntumor subpopulations with two mutations, and we derived semi-analytical\nestimates for the waiting time distribution to fixation. Our results suggest\nthat dedifferentiation may play an important role in carcinogenesis, depending\non how stem cell homeostasis is maintained. If the stem cell population size is\nheld strictly constant (due to all divisions being asymmetric), we found that\ndedifferentiation acts like a positive selective force in the stem cell\npopulation and thus speeds carcinogenesis. If the stem cell population size is\nallowed to vary stochastically with density-dependent reproduction rates\n(allowing both symmetric and asymmetric divisions), we found that\ndedifferentiation beyond a critical threshold leads to exponential growth of\nthe stem cell population. Thus, dedifferentiation may play a crucial role, the\ncommon modeling assumption of constant stem cell population size may not be\nadequate, and further progress in understanding carcinogenesis demands a more\ndetailed mechanistic understanding of stem cell homeostasis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Aug 2013 17:50:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

Generally, the spatial resolution is defined by (some\nmultiple of) the softening length, whose value is set as a compromise between\nthe desired resolution and the need for limiting small-scale noise. Several\nworks have studied the question whether a softening scale fixed in space and\ntime provides a good enough modelling of an astrophysical system. Here we\naddress this question within the context of dynamical simulations and disc\ninstabilities. We first follow the evolution of a galaxy-like object in\nisolation and then set up a simulation of an idealised merger event. Alongside\na run using the standard fixed-softening approach, we performed simulations\nwhere the softening lengths were let to vary from particle to particle\naccording to the evolution of the local density field in space and time. Even\nthough during the most violent phases of the merging the fixed-softening\nsimulation tends to underestimate the resulting matter densities, as far as the\nevolution of the disc component is concerned we found no significant\ndifferences among the runs.

All PNs are identified through the on-off band\ntechnique using automatic selection criteria based on the distribution of the\ndetected sources in the colour-magnitude diagram and the properties of their\npoint-spread function. We extract a catalogue of 688 objects down to\nm_5007=28.4, with an estimated residual contamination from foreground stars and\nbackground Lyalpha galaxies, which amounts to ~35% of the sample.

The JWST is capable of obtaining\nthe first spectroscopic measurements of such planets, yet there are no known\nplanets around WDs. Here we propose to take advantage of the unique capability\nof the Kepler spacecraft in the 2-Wheels mode to perform a transit survey that\nis capable of identifying the first planets in the habitable zone of a WD. We\npropose to obtain Kepler time-series photometry of 10,000 WDs in the SDSS\nimaging area to search for planets in the habitable zone. Thanks to the large\nfield of view of Kepler, for the first time in history, a large number of WDs\ncan be observed at the same time, which is essential for discovering transits.\nOur proposed survey requires a total of 200 days of observing time, and will\nfind up to 100 planets in the WD habitable zone. This survey will maintain\nKepler's spirit of searching for habitable Earths, but near new hosts. With\nfew-day observations and minute-cadences per field, it will also open up a\ncompletely unexplored discovery space. In addition to planets, this survey is\nsensitive to pulsating WDs, as well as eclipsing short period stellar and\nsubstellar companions. These have important implications for constraining the\ndouble WD merger rate and their contribution to Type Ia supernovae and the\ngravitational wave foreground. Given the relatively low number density of our\ntargets, this program can be combined with other projects that would benefit\nfrom high cadence and many-fields observations with Kepler, e.g. a transit\nsurvey of a magnitude-limited, complete sample of nearby M dwarfs or\nasteroseismology of variable stars (e.g. RR Lyrae) in the same fields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Aug 2013 20:00:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-03"}

In particular, we focus on stars\nthought to have a radiative core and convective outer envelope by studying in\ndetail three individual DEBs: UV Psc, YY Gem, and CU Cnc. The results suggest\nthat the stabilization of thermal convection by a magnetic field is a plausible\nexplanation for the observed model-radius discrepancies. However, surface\nmagnetic field strengths required by the models are significantly stronger than\nthose estimated from the observed coronal X-ray emission. Agreement between\nmodel predicted surface magnetic field strengths and those inferred from X-ray\nobservations can be found by assuming that the magnetic field sources its\nenergy from convection. This approach makes the transport of heat by convection\nless efficient and is akin to reduced convective mixing length methods used in\nother studies. Predictions for the metallicity and magnetic field strengths of\nthe aforementioned systems are reported. We also develop an expression relating\na reduction in the convective mixing length to a magnetic field strength in\nunits of the equipartition value.

Precisely, our model is a network built from an underlying\nregular lattice over which long-range connections are randomly added according\nto the probability, $P_{ij}\\sim r_{ij}^{-\\alpha}$, where $r_{ij}$ is the\nManhattan distance between nodes $i$ and $j$, and the exponent $\\alpha$ is a\ncontrolling parameter.

Our results\nshow that the best flow conditions are obtained for $\\delta=0$ with $\\alpha=0$,\nwhile for $\\delta \\gg 1$ the overall conductance always increases with\n$\\alpha$. For $\\delta\\approx 1$, $\\alpha=d$ becomes the optimal exponent, where\n$d$ is the topological dimension of the substrate.

Motivated by these observations, we study\nthe non-radial oscillation modes of giant planets containing a solid core. Our\ncalculations include the elastic response of the core and consider a wide range\nof possible values of the core shear modulus. While the elasticity of the core\nonly slightly changes the frequencies of acoustic modes, which reside mostly in\nthe fluid envelope, it adds two new classes of shear modes that are largely\nconfined to the core. We also calculate the effects of the Coriolis force on\nthe planetary oscillation modes. In addition to changing the mode frequencies,\nthe Coriolis force can cause the shear modes to mix with the f-modes. Such\nmixing occurs when the frequencies of the shear mode and the f-mode are close\nto each other, and results in \"mixed modes\" with similar properties that are\nslightly split in frequency. We discuss our results in light of the recent work\nby Hedman & Nicholson (2013), which revealed the presence of density waves in\nSaturn's C-ring that appear to be excited by the gravitational perturbations\nassociated with the f-mode oscillations within Saturn. We find that the fine\nsplitting in wave frequencies observed in the rings can in principle be\nexplained by the rotation-induced mixing between core shear modes and f-modes,\npossibly indicating the presence of a solid core within Saturn. However, in our\ncurrent calculations, which assume rigid-body rotation and include only\nfirst-order rotational effects, significant fine-tuning in the planetary model\nparameters is needed in order to achieve these mode mixings and to explain the\nobserved fine frequency splitting. We briefly discuss other effects that may\nmodify the f-modes and facilitate mode mixing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Aug 2013 23:03:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-30"}

As shown by Taam et al. (2012), the\ntruncation radius as a function of mass accretion rate is strongly affected by\nincluding the magnetic field within the framework of disk evaporation model,\ni.e., an increase of the magnetic field results in a smaller truncation radius\nof the accretion disk. In this work, we calculate the emergent spectrum of an\ninner ADAF + an outer truncated accretion disk around a supermassive black hole\nbased on the prediction by Taam et al. (2012). It is found that an increase of\nthe magnetic field from $\\beta=0.8$ to $\\beta=0.5$ (with magnetic pressure\n$p_{\\rm m}=B^2/{8\\pi}=(1-\\beta)p_{\\rm tot}$, $p_{\\rm tot}=p_{\\rm gas}+p_{\\rm\nm}$) results in an increase of $\\sim 8.7$ times of the luminosity from the\ntruncated accretion disk.

We argue that in the disk\nevaporation model, the electrons in the corona are assumed to be heated only by\na transfer of energy from the ions to electrons via Coulomb collisions, which\nis reasonable for the accretion with a lower mass accretion rate. Coulomb\nheating is the dominated heating mechanism for the electrons only if the\nmagnetic field is strongly sub-equipartition, which is roughly consistent with\nobservations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 31 Aug 2013 10:13:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

But the nonlinear outcome of the elliptical instability has yet to be\ninvestigated in the parameter regime of interest, and the resulting turbulent\nenergy dissipation has not yet been quantified. We do so by performing three\ndimensional hydrodynamical simulations of a small patch of a tidally deformed\nfluid planet or star subject to the elliptical instability. We show that when\nthe tidal deformation is weak, the nonlinear outcome of the instability leads\nto the formation of long-lived columnar vortices aligned with the axis of\nrotation.

Therefore,\nthere has been much interest in inexact gradient methods (IGMs), in which an\nefficiently computable approximate gradient is used to perform the update in\neach iteration. Currently, non-asymptotic linear convergence results for IGMs\nare typically established under the assumption that the objective function is\nstrongly convex, which is not satisfied in many applications of interest; while\nlinear convergence results that do not require the strong convexity assumption\nare usually asymptotic in nature.

The Galactic chemical evolution of sulphur is still under debate. At\nlow metallicities some studies find no correlation between [S/Fe] and [Fe/H],\nothers find [S/Fe] increasing towards lower metallicities, and still others\nfind a combination of the two. Each scenario has different implications for the\nGalactic chemical evolution of sulphur.\n  Aims. To contribute to the discussion on the Galactic chemical evolution of\nsulphur by deriving sulphur abundances from non-LTE insensitive spectral\ndiagnostics in Disk and Halo stars with homogeneously determined stellar\nparameters.\n  Methods. We derive Teff from photometric colours, logg from stellar\nisochrones and Bayesian estimation, and [Fe/H] and [S/Fe] from spectrum\nsynthesis. We derive [S/Fe] from the [S i] 1082 nm line in 39 mostly cool and\nmetal-poor giants, using 1D LTE MARCS model atmospheres to model our\nhigh-resolution NIR spectra obtained with the VLT, NOT and Gemini South\ntelescopes.\n  Results. We derive homogeneous stellar parameters for 29 stars. Our results\nargue for a chemical evolution of sulphur that is typical for alpha-elements,\ncontrary to some previous studies. Our abundances are systematically higher by\nabout 0.1 dex in comparison to other studies that arrived at similar\nconclusions using other sulphur diagnostics.\n  Conclusions. We find the [S i] line to be a valuable diagnostic of sulphur\nabundances in cool giants down to [Fe/H] ~ -2.3. We argue that a homogeneous\ndetermination of stellar parameters is necessary, since the derived abundances\nare sensitive to them. Our results ([S/Fe]) show reasonable agreement with\npredictions of contemporary models of Galactic chemical evolution.

The proof of the Claude Berge's perfect graph\nconjecture in 2002 by Chudnovsky, Robertson, Seymour and Thomas has shed a new\nlight on this field of combinatorics. But some questions are still unsettled,\nparticulary the existence of a combinatorial algorithm for the coloring of\nperfect graphs.\n  An even pair of a graph is a pair of vertices such that every path joining\nthem has even length. As proved by Fonlupt and Uhry, the contraction of an even\npair preserves the chromatic number, and when applied recursively may lead to\nan optimal coloring. We prove a conjecture of Everett and Reed saying that this\nmethod works for a class of perfect graphs: Artemis graphs. This yields a\ncoloring algorithm for Artemis graphs with complexity $O(n^2m)$.\n  We give an $O(n^9)$ algorithm for the recognition of Artemis graphs.

To minimize the negative\nimpact of sensor noises, \\emph{SmartLoc} exploits the intermittent strong GPS\nsignals and uses the linear regression to build a prediction model which is\nbased on the trace estimated from inertial sensors and the one computed from\nthe GPS. Furthermore, we utilize landmarks (e.g., bridge, traffic lights)\ndetected automatically and special driving patterns (e.g., turning, uphill, and\ndownhill) from inertial sensory data to improve the localization accuracy when\nthe GPS signal is weak. Our evaluations of \\emph{SmartLoc} in the city\ndemonstrates its technique viability and significant localization accuracy\nimprovement compared with GPS and other approaches: the error is approximately\n20m for 90% of time while the known mean error of GPS is 42.22m.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 31 Aug 2013 04:56:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-31"}
