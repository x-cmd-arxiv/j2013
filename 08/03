Here we present clear\nand concise generalisations of two classic expansions of the three-body\ndisturbing function, simplifying considerably their original form and making\nthem accessible to the non-specialist. Governing the interaction between the\ninner and outer orbits of a hierarchical triple, the disturbing function in its\ngeneral form is the conduit for energy and angular momentum exchange and as\nsuch, governs the secular and resonant evolution of the system and its\nstability characteristics. Focusing here on coplanar systems, the first\nexpansion is one in the ratio of inner to outer semimajor axes and is valid for\nall eccentricities, while the second is an expansion in eccentricity and is\nvalid for all semimajor axis ratios [...]. Our generalizations make both\nformulations valid for arbitrary mass ratios. [...]. We demonstrate the\nequivalence of the new expansions, identifying the role of the spherical\nharmonic order m in both and its physical significance in the three-body\nproblem, and introducing the concept of principal resonances. Several examples\nof the accessibility of both expansions are given including resonance widths\nand the secular rates of change of the elements.

By\ntest-particle simulations and different spiral potential models with parameters\nconstrained on observations, we verified the formation of a minimum with\namplitude ~ 30% - 40% of the background disk stellar density at corotation.\nSuch minimum is formed by the secular angular momentum transfer between stars\nand the spiral density wave on both sides of corotation. We demonstrate that\nthe secular loss (gain) of angular momentum and decrease (increase) of mean\norbital radius of stars just inside (outside) corotation can counterbalance the\nopposite trend of exchange of angular momentum shown by stars orbiting the\nlibrational points L_4/5 at the corotation circle. Such secular processes\nactually allow steady spiral waves to promote radial migration across\ncorotation. We propose some observational evidences for the minimum stellar\ndensity in the Galactic disk, such as its direct relation to the minimum in the\nobserved rotation curve of the Galaxy at the radius R ~ 9 kpc (for R_0 = 7.5\nkpc), as well as its association with a minimum in the distribution of Galactic\nradii of a sample of open clusters older than 1 Gyr. The closeness of the solar\norbit radius to the corotation resonance implies that the solar orbit lies\ninside a ring of minimum surface density (stellar + gas). This also implies in\na correction to larger values for the estimated total mass of the Galactic\ndisk, and consequently, a greater contribution of the disk component to the\ninner rotation curve of the Galaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Aug 2013 21:58:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

We find that the unusual lightcurve shapes of PTFO\n8-8695 can be explained by transits of a planet across an oblate,\ngravity-darkened stellar disk. We simultaneously and self-consistently fit two\nseparate lightcurves observed in 2009 December and 2010 December. Our two\nself-consistent fits yield M_p = 3.0 M_Jup and M_p = 3.6 M_Jup for assumed\nstellar masses of M_* = 0.34 M_Sun and M_* = 0.44 M_Sun respectively. The two\nfits have precession periods of 293 days and 581 days. These mass\ndeterminations (consistent with previous upper limits) along with the strength\nof the gravity-darkened precessing model together validate PTFO 8-8695b as just\nthe second Hot Jupiter known to orbit an M-dwarf. Our fits show a high degree\nof spin-orbit misalignment in the PTFO 8-8695 system: 69 +/- 2 or 73.1 +/- 0.5\ndegrees, in the two cases. The large misalignment is consistent with the\nhypothesis that planets become Hot Jupiters with random orbital plane\nalignments early in a system's lifetime. We predict that as a result of the\nhighly misaligned, precessing system, the transits should disappear for months\nat a time over the course of the system's precession period. The precessing,\ngravity-darkened model also predicts other observable effects: changing orbit\ninclination that could be detected by radial velocity observations, changing\nstellar inclination that would manifest as varying v sin i, changing projected\nspin-orbit alignment that could be seen by the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect,\nchanging transit shapes over the course of the precession, and differing\nlightcurves as a function of wavelength. Our measured planet radii of 1.64\nR_Jup and 1.68 R_Jup in each case are consistent with a young,\nhydrogen-dominated planet that results from a hot-start formation mechanism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Aug 2013 22:03:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

We constructed a database by calculating the flare\nmicrowave emission for a wide range of these parameters. Out of this database\nwith more than 5,000 cases we extracted general flare properties by comparing\nthe observed and calculated microwave spectra. The analysis of NoRP data was\nmostly based in the center-to-limb variation of the flare properties with\nlooptop and footpoint electron distributions and for NoRH maps on the resultant\ndistribution of emission. One important aspect of this work is the comparison\nof the analysis of a flare using an inhomogeneous source model and a simplistic\nhomogeneous source model. Our results show clearly that the homogeneous source\nhypothesis is not appropriate to describe the possible flare geometry and its\nuse can easily produce misleading results in terms of non-thermal electron\ndensity and magnetic field strength. A center darkening of flares was also\nobtained as a geometrical property of the loop-like sources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Aug 2013 10:43:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

We suggest that this multiscale\nspatial cell organization also organizes signaling and coordinates cellular\nbehavior. We propose a new view of the spatial structure of cell signaling\nsystems. This new view describes cell signaling in terms of dynamic allosteric\ninteractions within and among distinct, spatially organized transient clusters.\nThe clusters vary over time and space and are on length scales from nanometers\nto micrometers. When considered across these length-scales, primary factors in\nthe spatial organization are cell membrane domains and the actin cytoskeleton,\nboth also highly dynamic. A key challenge is to understand the interplay across\nthese multiple scales, link it to the physicochemical basis of the\nconformational behavior of single molecules, and ultimately relate it to\ncellular function. Overall, our premise is that at these scales, cell signaling\nshould be thought of not primarily as a sequence of diffusion-controlled\nmolecular collisions, but instead transient, allostery-driven cluster\nre-forming interactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Aug 2013 14:09:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-06"}

More precisely, we show that the nonnegativity of the\nholomorphic sectional curvature is a necessary and sufficient condition for the\nthree circle theorem. As corollaries, two sharp monotonicity formulae for\nholomorphic functions are derived. Among applications, we derive sharp\ndimension estimates (with rigidity) of holomorphic functions with polynomial\ngrowth when the holomorphic sectional curvature is nonnegative. When the\nbisectional curvature is nonnegative, this was due to Ni. Also we study\nholomorphic functions with polynomial growth near infinity. On a complete\nnoncompact K\\\"ahler manifold with nonnegative bisectional curvature, we prove\nany holomorphic function with polynomial growth is homogenous at infinity. This\nresult is closely related with Yau's conjecture on the finite generation of\nholomorphic functions (see page $3-4$ for detailed explanation).\n  We also generalize the three circle theorem to K\\\"ahler manifolds with\nholomorphic sectional curvature lower bound.
