The highest spectra of galactic protons (and other cosmic\nrays) were recorded by the PAMELA instrument at Earth in late 2009, in contrast\nto expectations. The spectrum, between 100 MeV and 50 GeV, for December 2009 is\ncompared to proton spectra observed during previous solar minimum periods, back\nto 1965. Corresponding numerical modeling is presented which predicts that the\nnext solar minimum spectra could even be higher if similar modulation\nconditions then would occur as in 2008-2009. The reason is that incorporating\ngradient and curvature drifts in modulation models causes proton spectra for A\n> 0 solar magnetic cycles (e.g., around 1976, 1997) to always be higher than\nduring A < 0 cycles (e.g. around 1965, 1987, 2009) at energies below a few GeV,\nif the same modulation conditions would prevail.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Aug 2013 16:02:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-08"}

The system is characterized by a network of $SiO_4$\ntetrahedra disrupted by $Li$ ions which diffuse through the network. Measures\nof mean square displacement of $Si$ and $O$ atoms allow us to identify a\ntemperature at which tetrahedra stop moving relative to each other. This\ntemperature $T_c\\approx 1500\\,K$ can be characterized within the framework of\nmode coupling theory. At a much lower temperature $T_g\\approx 1000\\,K$, a\nchange in the slope of the volume versus temperature data allows to single out\nthe glass transition. We find signatures of both transitions in structural\norder parameters, related to the orientation of tetrahedra. Going down in\ntemperature we find that, around the mode coupling transition temperature, a\nset of order parameters which measure the relative orientation of tetrahedra\ncease to increase and stay constant below $T_c$. Another well known measure of\norientational order, the bond orientational order parameter, which in the\nstudied system measures local order within single tetrahedrons, is found to\ncontinue growing below $T_c$ until $T_g$, below which it remains constant. Our\nresults allow to relate two characteristic dynamic transitions with\ncorresponding structural transitions, as observed in two different\norientational order parameters. Furthermore, the results indicate that the\nnetwork of thetrahedra continue to relax well below the point where neighboring\ntetrahedra cannot rearrange relative to each other, and the glass is reached\nonly upon a process of relaxation of atoms which form the thetrahedron, as\nquantified by the change in the bond orientational order parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Aug 2013 16:38:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-03"}

The inter-dot chain strongly\ninfluences the transport across the system and the Local Density of States of\nthe dots. We study the case of small number of sites, so that Kondo box effects\nare present, varying the coupling between the dots and the chain. For odd N and\nsmall coupling between the inter-dot chain and the dots, a state with two\ncoexisting Kondo regimes develops: the bulk Kondo due to the quantum dots\nconnected to leads and the one produced by the screening of the quantum dots\nspins by the spin in the finite chain at the Fermi level. As the coupling to\nthe inter-dot chain increases, there is a crossover to a molecular Kondo\neffect, due to the screening of the molecule (formed by the finite chain and\nthe quantum dots) spin by the leads. For even N the two-Kondo temperatures\nregime does not develop and the physics is dominated by the usual competition\nbetween Kondo and antiferromagnetism between the quantum dots.

We\npropose here to study white dwarf viscous properties using short period (< 1\nhr), detached white dwarf binaries, such as the newly discovered ~12.8 min\nsystem. These binaries are wide enough that mass transfer has not yet started\nbut close enough that the least massive component is subject to a measurable\ntidal deformation. The associated tidal torque transfers orbital energy, which\nis partially converted into heat by the action of viscosity within the deformed\nstar. As a consequence, its outer non-degenerate layers expand, and the star\npuffs up. We self-consistently calculate the fractional change in radius, and\nthe degree of asynchronism (ratio of stellar to orbital spin) as a function of\nthe viscous time. Specializing our calculations to J0651, we find that the\ndiscrepancy between the measured radius of the secondary star and He white\ndwarf model predictions can be interpreted as tidal inflation if the viscous\ntimescale is either ~2 10^5 yr or ~10^4 yr. Such values point to a\nnon-microscopic viscosity, possibly given by tidally induced turbulence, or by\nmagnetic field stresses with a magnetic field strength of 10-100 Gauss.\nFortunately, these two timescales produce very different degree of\nasynchronism, with the shortest one, bringing the system much closer to\nsynchronisation. A measurement of the stellar spin can thus univocally\ndetermined the mean viscosity. Extrapolating the secondary's radial expansion,\nwe predict that the star will fill is Roche lobe at a separation which is\n1.2-1.3 smaller than the current one.

This means that the effects of\nrotation on atmospheric dynamics will be relatively weak, which requires small\nhorizontal temperature gradients above the boundary layer of terrestrial\natmospheres. An analytically solvable and dynamically consistent model for\nplanetary climate with only three free parameters can be constructed by making\nthe weak temperature gradient (WTG) approximation, which assumes temperatures\nare horizontally uniform aloft. The extreme numerical efficiency of a WTG model\ncompared to a 3D general circulation model (GCM) makes it an optimal tool for\nMonte Carlo fits to observables over parameter space. Additionally, such\nlow-order models are critical for developing physical intuition and coupling\natmospheric dynamics to models of other components of planetary climate. The\nobjective of this paper is to determine whether a WTG model provides an\nadequate approximation of the effect of atmospheric dynamics on quantities\nlikely to be observed over the next decade. To do this we first tune a WTG\nmodel to GCM output for an Earth-like tidally locked planet with a dry, 1 bar\natmosphere, then generate and compare the expected phase curves of both models.\nWe find that differences between the two models would be extremely difficult to\ndetect from phase curves using JWST. This result demonstrates the usefulness of\nthe WTG approximation when used in conjunction with GCMs as part of a modeling\nhierarchy to understand the climate of remote planets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Aug 2013 20:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

Recently,\nwithin the context of random matrix models, it was shown how to build resurgent\ntransseries solutions encoding the full nonperturbative information beyond the\n't Hooft genus expansion. On the other hand, via large N duality, random matrix\nmodels may be holographically described by B-model closed topological strings\nin local Calabi-Yau geometries. This raises the question of constructing the\ncorresponding holographically dual resurgent transseries, tantamount to\nnonperturbative topological string theory. This paper addresses this point by\nshowing how to construct resurgent transseries solutions to the holomorphic\nanomaly equations. These solutions are built upon (generalized) multi-instanton\nsectors, where the instanton actions are holomorphic. The asymptotic expansions\naround the multi-instanton sectors have both holomorphic and anti-holomorphic\ndependence, may allow for resonance, and their structure is completely fixed by\nthe holomorphic anomaly equations in terms of specific polynomials multiplied\nby exponential factors and up to the holomorphic ambiguities -- which\ngeneralizes the known perturbative structure to the full transseries. In\nparticular, the anti-holomorphic dependence has a somewhat universal character.\nFurthermore, in the nonperturbative sectors, holomorphic ambiguities may be\nfixed at conifold points. This construction shows the nonperturbative\nintegrability of the holomorphic anomaly equations, and sets the ground to\nstart addressing large-order analysis and resurgent nonperturbative completions\nwithin closed topological string theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Aug 2013 20:54:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Jul 2014 15:53:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 14 Jan 2015 15:12:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-15"}

We find that two distinct processes lead in Eris to a 30%\nenhancement of DM in the disk plane at the location of the Sun: the accretion\nand disruption of satellites resulting in a DM component with net angular\nmomentum and the contraction of baryons pulling DM into the disk plane without\nforcing it to co-rotate. Owing to its particularly quiescent merger history for\ndark halos of Milky Way mass, the co-rotating dark disk in Eris is less massive\nthan what has been suggested by previous work, contributing only 9% of the\nlocal DM density. The speed distribution in Eris is broadened and shifted to\nhigher speeds compared to its DM-only twin simulation ErisDark. At high speeds\n$f(v)$ falls more steeply in Eris than in ErisDark or the SHM, easing the\ntension between recent results from the CDMS-II and XENON100 experiments. The\nnon-Maxwellian aspects of $f(v)$ are still present, but much less pronounced in\nEris than in DM-only runs. The weak dark disk increases the time-averaged\nscattering rate by only a few percent at low recoil energies. On the high\nvelocity tail, however, the increase in typical speeds due to baryonic\ncontraction results in strongly enhanced mean scattering rates compared to\nErisDark, although they are still suppressed compared to the SHM. Similar\ntrends are seen regarding the amplitude of the annual modulation, while the\nmodulated fraction is increased compared to the SHM and decreased compared to\nErisDark.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Aug 2013 21:38:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 Mar 2014 17:31:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

We begin by completing the \\emph{perfect}\ndistinguishability problem of two-qubit ensembles - both for separable\noperations and LOCC - by providing necessary and sufficient conditions for the\nperfect discrimination of one pure and one mixed state. Then for the well-known\ntask of minimum error discrimination, it is shown that \\textit{almost all}\ntwo-qubit ensembles consisting of three pure states cannot be optimally\ndiscriminated using LOCC. This is surprising considering that \\textit{any} two\npure states can be distinguished optimally by LOCC. Special attention is given\nto ensembles that lack entanglement, and we prove an easy sufficient condition\nfor when a set of three product states cannot be optimally distinguished by\nLOCC, thus providing new examples of the phenomenon known as \"non-locality\nwithout entanglement\". We next consider an example of $N$ parties who each\nshare the same state but who are ignorant of its identity. The state is drawn\nfrom the rotationally invariant \"trine ensemble\", and we establish a tight\nconnection between the $N$-copy ensemble and Shor's \"lifted\" single-copy\nensemble. For any finite $N$, we prove that optimal identification of the\nstates cannot be achieved by LOCC; however as $N\\to\\infty$, LOCC can indeed\ndiscriminate the states optimally. This is the first result of its kind.\nFinally, we turn to the task of unambiguous discrimination and derive new lower\nbounds on the LOCC inconclusive probability for symmetric states. When applied\nto the double trine ensemble, this leads to a rather different\ndistinguishability character than when the minimum-error probability is\nconsidered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Aug 2013 02:33:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-14"}

The features of our works are sketched as follows. First\nof all, our state is modeled by stochastic Volterra-type equation which leads\nto some new study on stochastic \"integral\" system. This feature makes our setup\nsignificantly different from the previous mean field games where the states\nalways follow some stochastic \"differential\" equations. Actually, our\nstochastic integral system is rather general and can be viewed as natural\ngeneralization of stochastic differential equations. In addition, it also\nincludes some types of stochastic delayed systems as its special cases. Second,\nsome new techniques are explored to tackle our mean-field LQG games due to the\nspecial structure of integral system. For example, unlike the Riccati equation\nin linear controlled differential system, some Fredholm-type equations are\nintroduced to characterize the consistency condition of our integral system via\nthe resolvent kernels. Third, based on the state aggregation technique, the\nNash certainty equivalence (NCE) equation is derived and the set of associated\ndecentralized controls are verified to satisfy the $\\epsilon$-Nash equilibrium\nproperty. To this end, some new estimates of stochastic Volterra equations are\ndeveloped which also have their own interests.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Aug 2013 02:34:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-09"}

Power control and coding\nare key enabling technologies in wireless communications to ensure efficient\ncommunications. In the present work, we examine the role of power control and\ncoding for Kalman filtering over wireless correlated channels. Two estimation\narchitectures are considered: In the first, the sensors send their measurements\ndirectly to a single gateway. In the second scheme, wireless relay nodes\nprovide additional links. The gateway decides on the coding scheme and the\ntransmitter power levels of the wireless nodes.

Numerical results suggest that the proposed method may\nlead to energy savings of around 50 %, when compared to an alternative scheme,\nwherein transmission power levels and bit-rates are governed by simple logic.\nIn particular, zero-error coding is preferable at time instances with high\nchannel gains, whereas multiple-description coding is superior for time\ninstances with low gains.

The popularity and promise of crowdsourcing\nmarkets has led to both empirical and theoretical research on the design of\nalgorithms to optimize various aspects of these markets, such as the pricing\nand assignment of tasks. Much of the existing theoretical work on crowdsourcing\nmarkets has focused on problems that fall into the broad category of online\ndecision making; task requesters or the crowdsourcing platform itself make\nrepeated decisions about prices to set, workers to filter out, problems to\nassign to specific workers, or other things.

The Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) is said to play a key\nrole in forming a Neel-type domain wall that can be driven by the spin Hall\ntorque, a torque resulting from the spin current generated in a neighboring\nnon-magnetic layer via the spin Hall effect. Here we show that the sign of the\nDMI, which determines the direction to which a domain wall moves with current,\ncan be changed by modifying the adjacent non-magnetic layer. We find that the\nsense of rotation of a domain wall spiral is reversed when the Ta underlayer is\ndoped with nitrogen in Ta|CoFeB|MgO heterostructures. The spin Hall angle of\nthe Ta and nitrogen doped Ta underlayers carry the same sign, suggesting that\nthe sign of the DMI is defined at the interface. Depending on the sense of\nrotation, spin transfer torque and spin Hall torque can either compete or\nassist each other, thus influencing the efficiency of moving domain walls with\ncurrent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Aug 2013 04:25:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-09"}

Most astrophysical discs, however, are\nunder the influence of an external gravitational field which can affect their\nstability. A typical example is a galactic disc embedded in a dark matter halo.\nHere we do a linear perturbation analysis for a disc in an external field, and\nobtain a generalized dispersion relation and a modified stability criterion. An\nexternal field has two effects on the disc dynamics: first, it contributes to\nthe unperturbed rotational field, and second, it adds a tidal field term in the\nstability parameter. A typical disruptive tidal field results in a higher\nmodified Q value and hence leads to a more stable disc. We apply these results\nto the Milky Way, and to a low surface brightness galaxy UGC 7321. We find that\nin each case the stellar disc by itself is barely stable and it is the dark\nmatter halo that stabilizes the disc against local, axisymmetric gravitational\ninstabilities. This result has been largely missed so far because in practice\nthe value for Q for a galactic disc is obtained in a hybrid fashion using the\nobserved rotational field that is set by both the disc and the halo, and hence\nis higher than for a pure disc.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Aug 2013 04:33:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-09"}

The paper presents an overview of the chemistry in the\nmain water reservoirs in the disk around TW Hya. It discusses the limitations\nin the interpretation of observed water line fluxes. Methods. ... (abbreviated)\nResults. We report new line detections of p-H2O (3_22-2_11) at 89.99 micron and\nCO J=18-17 at 144.78 micron for the disk around TW Hya. Disk modeling shows\nthat the far-IR fine structure lines ([OI], [CII]) and molecular submm lines\nare very robust to uncertainties in the chemistry, while the water line fluxes\ncan change by factors of a few. The water lines are optically thick,\nsub-thermally excited and can couple to the background continuum radiation\nfield. The low-excitation water lines are also sensitive to uncertainties in\nthe collision rates, e.g. with neutral hydrogen. The gas temperature plays an\nimportant role for the [OI] fine structure line fluxes, the water line fluxes\noriginating from the inner disk as well as the high excitation CO, CH+ and OH\nlines. Conclusions. Due to their sensitivity on chemical input data and\nradiative transfer, water lines have to be used cautiously for understanding\ndetails of the disk structure. Water lines covering a wide range of excitation\nenergies provide access to the various gas phase water reservoirs (inside and\noutside the snow line) in protoplanetary disks and thus provide important\ninformation on where gas-phase water is potentially located.

It turns out that the contributions\nfrom the weakly-bound orbits with low orbital angular momenta $l$ play an\nimportant role. As an example, we investigate the neutron-rich Mg isotopes as a\nfunction of the pairing strength in situations, where the neuron Fermi surface\nare below, between and above two weakly-bound $2p$ levels. We find that the\nsize of the pairing correlations has a two-fold influence on the density\ndistribution of the neutrons and therefore on the total nuclear size. First it\ncan change the root mean square (rms) radius of the individual weakly-bound\norbits and second it can enhance the occupation probabilities of these orbits\nin the nuclear system. On one side increasing pairing correlations reduce the\nrms radii of the orbits with small orbital angular momenta close to the\ncontinuum limit (pairing anti-halo effect), on the other side they also can\nlead to an enhanced occupation of low-$l$ orbits above the Fermi surface\nproducing in this way a strong increase of the total radius of the nuclear\nsystem. As a consequence, a nuclear halo can form even in cases, where non of\nthe individual low-$l$ orbits is very close to the continuum. This leads to the\nfact that compared with well-bound nuclei, the impact of the pairing strength\non the nuclear size is more pronounced in weakly-bound nuclei than in\nwell-bound systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Aug 2013 07:19:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-09"}

By fixing the dark matter\nannihilation cross section $\\langle \\sigma\\upsilon\\rangle$ at some nominal\nvalues, we study the sensitivity of IceCube/DeepCore detector to dark matter\nspin-independent cross section $\\sigma_p^{\\rm SI}$ for $m_{\\chi}$ ranging from\nfew tens of GeV to 10 TeV. This sensitivity is compared with the existing\nIceCube 79-string constraint on the same cross section, which was obtained by\nsearching for dark matter annihilations in the Sun. We compare this sensitivity\nto dark matter direct detection results as well, in particular the XENON100\n(2012) limit and the parameter regions preferred by DAMA and CRESST-II\nexperiments. We also present IceCube/DeepCore sensitivity to $\\langle\n\\sigma\\upsilon \\rangle$ as a function of $m_{\\chi}$ by fixing $\\sigma_p^{\\rm\nSI}$ at XENON100 (2012) and XENON1T limits, respectively.

We conclude that\nthe search for dark matter annihilations in the Earth core provides competitive\nconstraints on $\\sigma_p^{\\rm SI}$ and $\\langle \\sigma\\upsilon \\rangle$ in the\ncase of low-mass dark matter.

Let $G=(V,E)$\nbe graph and let $f:V\\rightarrow \\{{\\rm red}, {\\rm blue}\\}$ be a 2-coloring. An\nedge $e\\in E$ is called red (blue) if both end-vertices of $e$ are red (blue).\nFor a 2-coloring $f$, let $r'_f$ and $b'_f$ be the number of red and blue edges\nand let $\\mu_f(G)=\\min\\{r'_f,b'_f\\}$.

This wave was initiated from AR 11261 on 2011 August 4 and\npropagated at velocities of 430--910 km\\s. It was observed to traverse another\nAR and cross over a filament channel on its path. The EUV wave perturbed\nneighboring AR loops and excited a disturbance that propagated toward the\nfootpoints of these loops. EIS observations of AR loops revealed that at the\ntime of the wave transit, the original redshift increased by about 3 km\\s,\nwhile the original blueshift decreased slightly.

The most popular method for nonequilibrium systems, forward flux\nsampling (FFS), samples rare events by using interfaces to partition the whole\ntransition process into sequence of steps along an order parameter connecting\nthe initial and final states. FFS usually suffers from two main difficulties:\nlow computational efficiency due to bad interface locations and even being not\napplicable when trapping into unknown intermediate metastable states. In the\npresent work, we propose an approach to overcome these difficulties, by\nself-adaptively locating the interfaces on the fly in an optimized manner.\nContrary to the conventional FFS which set the interfaces with euqal distance\nof the order parameter, our approach determines the interfaces with equal\ntransition probability which is shown to satisfy the optimization condition.\nThis is done by firstly running long local trajectories starting from the\ncurrent interface $\\l_i$ to get the conditional probability distribution $P_c$,\nand then determining $\\l_{i+1}$ by equalling $P_c$ to a give value $p_0$. With\nthese optimized interfaces, FFS can be run in a much efficient way. In\naddition, our approach can conveniently find the intermediate metastable states\nby monitoring some special long trajectories that nither end at the initial\nstate nor reach the next interface, the number of which will increase sharply\nfrom zero if such metastable states are encountered. We apply our approach to a\nmodel two-state system and a two-dimensional lattice gas Ising model. Our\napproach is shown to be much more efficient than the conventional FFS method\nwithout losing accuracy, and it can also well reproduce the two-step nucleation\nscenario of the Ising model with easy identification of the intermidiate\nmetastable state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Aug 2013 11:48:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-22"}

This paper aims to provide systematic\nevidence regarding how often Twitter is used to diffuse journal articles in the\nbiomedical and life sciences. The analysis is based on a set of 1.4 million\ndocuments covered by both PubMed and Web of Science (WoS) and published between\n2010 and 2012. The number of tweets containing links to these documents was\nanalyzed to evaluate the degree to which certain journals, disciplines, and\nspecialties were represented on Twitter. It is shown that, with less than 10%\nof PubMed articles mentioned on Twitter, its uptake is low in general.

The results show that tweeting behavior\nvaries between journals and specialties and correlations between tweets and\ncitations are low, implying that impact metrics based on tweets are different\nfrom those based on citations. A framework utilizing the coverage of articles\nand the correlation between Twitter mentions and citations is proposed to\nfacilitate the evaluation of novel social-media based metrics and to shed light\non the question in how far the number of tweets is a valid metric to measure\nresearch impact.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Aug 2013 13:09:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-09"}

Low temperature X-ray diffraction\nmeasurements have confirmed that the structural transition in these samples\noccurs near 140 K, compared to a transition temperature of 156 K observed in\npolycrystalline samples. Isotherms of magnetoresistivity measured as a function\nof magnetic field can be scaled onto a single curve in which the scaling field\nis a linear function of temperature between 2.2 K and 180 K.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Aug 2013 15:57:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

We fit six different models to\nthe HISMF and find that a Schechter function that extends down to a 1% HI gas\nfraction, with an additional fractional contribution below that limit, is the\nbest parametrization of the HISMF. We calculate Omega_{HI, M_* >10^10} and find\nthat massive galaxies contribute 41% of the HI density in the local universe.\nIn addition to the binned HISMF we derive a continuous bivariate fit, which\nreveals that the Schechter parameters only vary weakly with stellar mass:\nM_HI^*, the characteristic HI mass, scales as M_*^0.39, alpha, the slope of the\nHISMF at moderate HI masses, scales as M_*^0.07, and f, the fraction of\ngalaxies with HI gas fraction greater than 1%, scales as M_*^-0.24. The\nvariation of f with stellar mass should be a strong constraint for numerical\nsimulations. To understand the physical mechanisms that produce the shape of\nthe HISMF we redefine the parameters of the Schechter function as explicit\nfunctions of stellar mass and star formation rate to produce a trivariate fit.\nThis analysis reveals strong trends with SFR. While M_HI^* varies weakly with\nstellar mass and SFR, alpha is a stronger function of both stellar mass and\nespecially star formation rate. The HISMF is a crucial tool that can be used to\nconstrain cosmological galaxy simulations, test observational predictions of\nthe HI content of populations of galaxies, and identify galaxies whose\nproperties deviate from average trends.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Aug 2013 20:00:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

We present a detailed disk-integrated and disk-resolved\nphotometric analysis using the Framing Camera images with the Minnaert model\nand the Hapke model, and report our results about the global photometric\nproperties of Vesta. The photometric properties of Vesta show weak or no\ndependence on wavelengths, except for the albedo. At 554 nm, the global average\ngeometric albedo of Vesta is 0.38+/-0.04, and the Bond albedo range is\n0.20+/-0.02. The bolometric Bond albedo is 0.18+/-0.01. The phase function of\nVesta is similar to those of S-type asteroids. Vesta's surface shows a\nsingle-peaked albedo distribution with a full-width-half-max ~17% relative to\nthe global average. This width is much smaller than the full range of albedos\n(from ~0.55x to >2x global average) in localized bright and dark areas of a few\ntens of km in sizes, and is probably a consequence of significant regolith\nmixing on the global scale. Rheasilvia basin is about 10% brighter than the\nglobal average. The phase reddening of Vesta measured from Dawn Framing Camera\nimages is comparable or slightly stronger than that of Eros as measured by the\nNear Earth Asteroid Rendezvous mission, but weaker than previous measurements\nbased on ground-based observations of Vesta and laboratory measurements of HED\nmeteorites. The photometric behaviors of Vesta are best described by the Hapke\nmodel and the Akimov disk- function, when compared with the Minnaert model,\nLommel-Seeliger model, and Lommel- Seeliger-Lambertian model. The traditional\napproach for photometric correction is validated for Vesta for >99% of its\nsurface where reflectance is within +/-30% of global average.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Aug 2013 20:47:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}
