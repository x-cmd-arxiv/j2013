These then represent spatial objects in geo-information- (GIS) or CAD\nsystems or in building information models (BIM). Volume objects may then either\nbe represented by their 2D boundary or by a dedicated 3D-element, the \"solid\".\nThe latter may share common boundary elements with other solids, just as\n2D-polygon topologies in GIS share common boundary edges. Despite the frequent\nreference to \"topology\" in publications on spatial modelling the formal link\nbetween mathematical topology and these \"topological\" models is hardly\ndescribed in the literature. Such link, for example, cannot be established by\nthe often cited nine-intersections model which is too elementary for that\npurpose. Mathematically, the link between spatial data and the modelled \"real\nworld\" entities is established by a chain of \"continuous functions\" - a very\nimportant topological notion, yet often overlooked by spatial data modellers.\nThis article investigates how spatial data can actually be considered\ntopological spaces, how continuous functions between them are defined, and how\nCAD systems can make use of them. Having found examples of applications of\ncontinuity in CAD data models it turns out that of continuity has much\npractical relevance for CAD systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Aug 2013 16:14:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-02"}

In this way, classifiers trained on the sparse codes in the source\ndomain consisting of frontal faces for example can be applied to the target\ndomain (consisting of faces in different poses, illumination conditions, etc)\nwithout much loss in recognition accuracy. The approach is to first learn a\ndomain base dictionary, and then describe each domain shift (identity, pose,\nillumination) using a sparse representation over the base dictionary. The\ndictionary adapted to each domain is expressed as sparse linear combinations of\nthe base dictionary. In the context of face recognition, with the proposed\ncompositional dictionary approach, a face image can be decomposed into sparse\nrepresentations for a given subject, pose and illumination respectively. This\napproach has three advantages: first, the extracted sparse representation for a\nsubject is consistent across domains and enables pose and illumination\ninsensitive face recognition. Second, sparse representations for pose and\nillumination can subsequently be used to estimate the pose and illumination\ncondition of a face image.

The subspace clustering\nproblem has been extensively studied in the literature to partition such\nhigh-dimensional data into clusters corresponding to their underlying\nlow-dimensional subspaces. However, low-dimensional intrinsic structures are\noften violated for real-world observations, as they can be corrupted by errors\nor deviate from ideal models. We propose to address this by learning a linear\ntransformation on subspaces using matrix rank, via its convex surrogate nuclear\nnorm, as the optimization criteria. The learned linear transformation restores\na low-rank structure for data from the same subspace, and, at the same time,\nforces a high-rank structure for data from different subspaces. In this way, we\nreduce variations within the subspaces, and increase separations between the\nsubspaces for more accurate subspace clustering. This proposed learned robust\nsubspace clustering framework significantly enhances the performance of\nexisting subspace clustering methods. To exploit the low-rank structures of the\ntransformed subspaces, we further introduce a subspace clustering technique,\ncalled Robust Sparse Subspace Clustering, which efficiently combines robust PCA\nwith sparse modeling.

Motivated by the scenario that the coronal upflows\ncould be cumulative result of numerous individual flow pulses generated by\nsporadic heating events (nanoflares) at the loop base, we construct a velocity\ndriver with repetitive tiny pulses, whose energy frequency distribution follows\nthe flare power-law scaling.

Worker\nheterogeneity leads to a problem called the assembly line worker assignment and\nbalancing problem (ALWABP).

Mechanisms such as resistive\ndissipation and shock waves appear insufficient to account for the persistence\nand uniformity of this heating as inferred from both UV lines and continuum\nmeasurements. This paper further develops the theory of the Farley-Buneman\nInstability (FBI) which could contribute substantially to this heating. It\nexpands upon the single ion theory presented by Fontenla (2005) by developing a\nmultiple ion species approach that better models the diverse, metal-dominated\nion plasma of the solar chromosphere. This analysis generates a linear\ndispersion relationship that predicts the critical electron drift velocity\nneeded to trigger the instability. Using careful estimates of collision\nfrequencies and a one-dimensional, semi-empirical model of the chromosphere,\nthis new theory predicts that the instability may be triggered by velocities as\nlow as 4 km s^-1, well below the neutral acoustic speed. In the Earth's\nionosphere, the FBI occurs frequently in situations where the instability\ntrigger speed significantly exceeds the neutral acoustic speed. From this, we\nexpect neutral flows rising from the photosphere to have enough energy to\neasily create electric fields and electron Hall drifts with sufficient\namplitude to make the FBI common in the chromosphere. If so, this process will\nprovide a mechanism to convert neutral flow and turbulence energy into electron\nthermal energy in the quiet Sun.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Aug 2013 19:21:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 2 Aug 2013 18:10:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 23 Aug 2013 16:19:41 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 10 Mar 2014 20:00:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-12"}

In a two-dimensional mission\nspace, such simple solutions can no longer be derived. An alternative is to\noptimally assign each agent a linear trajectory, motivated by the\none-dimensional analysis.

Within the BEC regime the quasiparticle dispersion\ndevelops a flat valence-band top in accord with the experimental finding for\nTa$_2$NiSe$_5$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Aug 2013 21:24:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Jan 2014 08:51:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-15"}

In Monte Carlo (MC)\ncalculations, the BSR can be modeled explicitly, but only when treatment head\ngeometry is available. In this study, monitor backscatter factors (MBSFs),\ndefined as the ratio of the charge collected in the monitor chamber for a\nreference field to that of a given field, have been evaluated experimentally\nand incorporated into MC modelling of linacs with either known or unknown\ntreatment head geometry.\n  Materials and methods: A telescopic technique similar to that by Kubo (1989)\nwas used. However, instead of lead slits, a 1.8 mm diameter collimator and a\nsmall (2 mm diameter) detector positioned at extended SDD were used. This setup\nprovided a field of view to the source of less than 3.1 mm and allowed for MBSF\nmeasurements of open fields from 1 x 1 to 40 x 40 cm2.

A method for deriving the Dchforward\nvalues that are used in MC absolute dose calculations was demonstrated.

For the open\nfield sizes modeled in this study for the 21EX, the measured MBSFs agreed with\nMC calculated values within combined statistical (0.4%) and experimental (0.2%)\nuncertainties. Variation of MBSFs across field sizes was about a factor of two\nsmaller for the TrueBeam compared to 21EX Varian linacs.\n  Conclusions: Measured MBSFs and the derived Dchforward factors allow for the\nincorporation of the BSR effect into accurate radiotherapy dose calculations\nwithout explicit backscatter modelling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Aug 2013 22:12:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Nov 2013 20:43:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

These polymorphisms are expected to be removed or\nkept at low frequency by the action of natural selection, and rare deleterious\nvariants have been implicated as a possible explanation for the \"missing\nheritability\" seen in many studies of complex traits. Nonetheless, the effect\nof positive selection on linked sites or drift in small or inbred populations\nmay also impact the evolution of deleterious alleles. Here, we made use of\ngenome-wide genotyping data to characterize deleterious variants in a large\npanel of maize inbred lines. We show that, in spite of small effective\npopulation sizes and inbreeding, most putatively deleterious SNPs are indeed at\nlow frequencies within individual genetic groups. We find that genes showing\nassociations with a number of complex traits are enriched for deleterious\nvariants. Together these data are consistent with the dominance model of\nheterosis, in which complementation of numerous low frequency, weak deleterious\nvariants contribute to hybrid vigor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Aug 2013 00:28:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-05"}

To unravel\nthe underlying physical process, we investigate the 21 cm structures of three\ndifferent ionizing sources, Population (Pop) III stars, the first galaxies, and\nthe first quasars, by using radiative transfer simulations that include both\nionization of neutral hydrogen and resonant scattering of Lya photons. We find\nthat Pop III stars and quasars produce a smooth transition from an ionized and\nhot state to a neutral and cold one, owing to their hard spectral energy\ndistribution with abundant ionizing photons, in contrast to the sharp\ntransition in galaxies. Furthermore, Lya scattering plays a dominant role in\nproducing the 21 cm signal as it determines the relation between hydrogen spin\ntemperature and gas kinetic temperature. This effect, also called\nWouthuysen-Field coupling, depends strongly on the ionizing source. It is the\nstrongest around galaxies, where the spin temperature is highly coupled to that\nof the gas, resulting in extended absorption troughs in the 21 cm brightness\ntemperature. On the other hand, in the case of Pop III stars, the 21 cm signal\nshows both emission and absorption regions around a small HII bubble. For\nquasars, a large emission region in the 21 cm signal is produced, and the\nabsorption region decreases as the size of the HII bubble becomes large due to\nthe limited traveling time of photons. We predict that future surveys from\nlarge radio arrays such as MWA, LOFAR and SKA may be able to detect the 21 cm\nsignals of primordial galaxies and quasars, but not likely Pop III stars due to\nits small angular diameter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Aug 2013 00:55:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Sep 2014 11:37:28 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 23 Oct 2014 22:28:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

A crucial difference from the $D=10, N=1$ theory\nis that the fermions states are Dirac particles instead of Majorana-Weyl.

Our knowledge on their importance to dust production\nis, however, limited by observationally poor constraints on the nature and\namount of dust particles produced by individual SNe. In this paper, we present\na spectrum covering optical through near-Infrared (NIR) light of the luminous\nType IIn supernova (SN IIn) 2010jl around one and half years after the\nexplosion. This unique data set reveals multiple signatures of newly formed\ndust particles. The NIR portion of the spectrum provides a rare example where\nthermal emission from newly formed hot dust grains is clearly detected. We\ndetermine the main population of the dust species to be carbon grains at a\ntemperature of ~1,350 - 1,450K at this epoch. The mass of the dust grains is\nderived to be ~(7.5 - 8.5) x 10^{-4} Msun. Hydrogen emission lines show\nwavelength-dependent absorption, which provides a good estimate on the typical\nsize of the newly formed dust grains (~0.1 micron, and most likely <~0.01\nmicron). We attribute the dust grains to have been formed in a dense cooling\nshell as a result of a strong SN-circumstellar media (CSM) interaction. The\ndust grains occupy ~10% of the emitting volume, suggesting an inhomogeneous,\nclumpy structure. The average CSM density is required to be >~3 x 10^{7}\ncm^{-3}, corresponding to a mass loss rate of >~0.02 Msun yr^{-1} (for a mass\nloss wind velocity of ~100 km s^{-1}). This strongly supports a scenario that\nSN 2010jl and probably other luminous SNe IIn are powered by strong\ninteractions within very dense CSM, perhaps created by Luminous Blue Variable\n(LBV)-like eruptions within the last century before the explosion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Aug 2013 04:45:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

This regime can\ndominate at BH binary separations of a few tens of parsecs and below, following\na phase of orbital circularization dominated by local dynamical friction.

The structure is a\nperiodic arrangement of alternating nonlinear and magnetic layers (a\none-dimensional photonic crystal) with one of the layers doubled to create a\ndefect where periodicity is violated. Strong enhancement of nonreciprocity is\nobserved at the frequencies of the defect modes, where linearly polarized light\nincident from one side of the structure undergoes 90 deg polarization rotation\nupon reflection, while light reflected from the other side has its polarization\nunchanged. Using the nonlinear transfer matrix calculations in the frequency\ndomain, it is demonstrated that defect resonances in the nonlinear reflection\nspectra undergo bending, resulting in polarization bistability of reflected\nlight. This bistability is shown to result in abrupt switching between linear\npolarization of the output reflected light when the input intensity is varied.\nThis switching is confirmed in finite-difference time-domain simulations, and\nits hysteresis character is established.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Aug 2013 08:25:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-07"}

The dust induced changes in these parameters were\nobtained by fitting simulated images of composite systems (containing a disk\nand a bulge) produced using radiative transfer calculations. The simulations\nwere fitted with the GALFIT 3.0.2 data analysis algorithm. Fits were done with\nboth a combination of an exponential plus a variable-index Sersic function as\nwell as with a combination of two variable-index Sersic functions. We find that\ndust is biasing the derived exponential scale-length of decomposed disks\ntowards smaller values than would be otherwise derived if the galaxy were to\nhave no bulge. Similarly, the derived bulge-to-disk ratio is biased towards\nsmaller values. However, the derived axis-ratio of the disk is not changed in\nthe decomposition process. The derived effective radius of decomposed disks of\nsystems having exponential bulges is found to be less affected by dust when\nfits are done with two variable-index Sersic functions.

Namely, I provide an explicit, functorial\nconstruction \\Psi which, with each super Harish-Chandra pair, associates an\naffine supergroup that is always globally strongly split (in short, gs-split) -\nthus setting a link with the first part of the paper. On the other hand, there\nexists a natural functor \\Phi from affine supergroups to super Harish-Chandra\npairs: then I show that the new functor \\Psi - which goes the other way round -\nis indeed a quasi-inverse to \\Phi, provided we restrict our attention to the\nsubcategory of affine supergroups that are gs-split. Therefore, (the\nrestrictions of) \\Phi and \\Psi are equivalences between the categories of\ngs-split affine supergroups and of super Harish-Chandra pairs. Such a result\nwas known in other contexts, such as the smooth differential or the complex\nanalytic one, or in some special cases, via different approaches: the novelty\nin the present paper lies in that I construct a different functor \\Psi and thus\nextend the result to a much larger setup, with a totally different, more\ngeometrical method (very concrete indeed, and characteristic free).\n  The case of linear algebraic groups is treated also as an intermediate,\ninspiring step.\n  Some examples, applications and further generalizations are presented at the\nend of the paper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Aug 2013 10:54:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Sep 2013 14:21:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 16 Sep 2013 21:18:54 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 29 Apr 2014 09:55:03 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 30 Apr 2014 16:46:54 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Tue, 7 Apr 2015 20:24:22 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Thu, 17 Sep 2015 16:17:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-18"}

In particular, using satellite\nimagery data, we develop a statistical model of atmospheric transport that\nrelies on a latent Gaussian Markov random field (GMRF) for inference. In doing\nso, we make a link between the optical flow method of Horn and Schunck and the\nformulation of the transport process as a latent field in a generalized linear\nmodel, which enables the use of the integrated nested Laplace approximation for\ninference. This framework is specified such that it satisfies the so-called\nintegrated continuity equation, thereby intrinsically expressing the divergence\nof the field as a multiplicative factor covering air compressibility and\nsatellite column projection. The importance of this step -- as well as treating\nthe problem in a fully statistical manner -- is emphasized by a simulation\nstudy where inference based on this latent GMRF clearly reduces errors of the\nestimated flow field.

As such, Bell inequality violations achieved\nthrough entangled states are able to characterise the quantum advantage of\ncertain tasks, so long as the task itself imposes no restriction on the\navailability of correlated bits. However, if the number of shared bits is\nlimited, additional constraints are placed on the possible LHV models and\nseparable, i.e. disentangled, states may become a useful resource.

It is a precondition to using a graph model for routing that\nall edges have weights. Weights that capture travel times and GHG emissions can\nbe extracted from GPS trajectory data collected from the network. However, GPS\ntrajectory data typically lack the coverage needed to assign weights to all\nedges. This paper formulates and addresses the problem of annotating all edges\nin a road network with travel cost based weights from a set of trips in the\nnetwork that cover only a small fraction of the edges, each with an associated\nground-truth travel cost. A general framework is proposed to solve the problem.\nSpecifically, the problem is modeled as a regression problem and solved by\nminimizing a judiciously designed objective function that takes into account\nthe topology of the road network. In particular, the use of weighted PageRank\nvalues of edges is explored for assigning appropriate weights to all edges, and\nthe property of directional adjacency of edges is also taken into account to\nassign weights. Empirical studies with weights capturing travel time and GHG\nemissions on two road networks (Skagen, Denmark, and North Jutland, Denmark)\noffer insight into the design properties of the proposed techniques and offer\nevidence that the techniques are effective.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Aug 2013 12:56:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Aug 2013 20:00:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-19"}

Its radio emission alternates\nbetween a highly organized state with regular drifting subpulses (B mode) and a\nchaotic emission pattern (Q mode). We present the results of XMM-Newton\nobservations showing that the X-ray properties of PSR B0943+10 depend on its\nradio state (Hermsen et al. 2013). During the radio fainter state (Q mode) the\nX-ray flux is more than a factor two larger than during the B-mode and X-ray\npulsations with about 50% pulsed fraction are detected. The X-ray emission of\nPSR B0943+10 in the B-mode is well described by thermal emission with blackbody\ntemperature kT=0.26 keV coming from a small hot spot with luminosity of 7x10^28\nerg/s, in good agreement with the prediction of the partially screened gap\nmodel, which also explains the properties of the radio emission in this mode.\nWe derived an upper limit of 46% on the X-ray pulsed fraction in the B-mode,\nconsistent with the geometry and viewing angle of PSR B0943+10 inferred from\nthe radio data. The higher flux observed during the Q-mode is consistent with\nthe appearance of an additional component with a power-law spectrum with photon\nindex 2.2.

Our strategy enables to simulate the oscillatory problem\nwithout using any mesh or time step refinement, and the orders of our schemes\nare preserved uniformly in all regimes. In other words, since our numerical\nmethod is not based on the derivation and the simulation of asymptotic models,\nit works in the regime where the solution does not oscillate rapidly, in the\nhighly oscillatory limit regime, and in the intermediate regime with the same\norder of accuracy.

We discuss the idea of using the\nMAC-E-Filter in a time-of-flight mode (MAC-E-TOF) in which the neutrino mass is\ndetermined by a measurement of the electron time-of-flight (TOF) spectrum that\ndepends on the neutrino mass. MAC-E-TOF spectroscopy here is a very sensitive\nmethod since the $\\beta$-electrons are slowed down to distinguishable\nvelocities by the MAC-E-Filter. Their velocity depends strongly on their\nsurplus energy above the electric retarding potential. Using MAC-E-TOF, a\nstatistical sensitivity gain is expected. Because a small number of\nretarding-potential settings is sufficient for a complete measurement, in\ncontrast to about 40 different retarding potentials used in the standard\nMAC-E-Filter mode, there is a gain in measurement time and hence statistical\npower. The improvement of the statistical uncertainty of the squared neutrino\nmass has been determined by Monte Carlo simulation to be a factor 5 for an\nideal case neglecting background and timing uncertainty. Additionally, two\nscenarios to determine the time-of-flight of the $\\beta$-electrons are\ndiscussed, which use the KATRIN detector for creating the stop signal and\ndifferent methods for obtaining a start signal.

A key task today is to use the influx of\nincreasingly precise observational data to constrain the plethora of\ninflationary models suggested by fundamental theories of interactions. This\nrequires a robust theoretical framework for quantifying the predictions of such\nmodels; helping to develop such a framework is the aim of this thesis. We\nprovide the first complete quantization of subhorizon perturbations for the\nwell-motivated class of multi-field inflationary models with a non-trivial\nfield metric, which we show may yield interesting signatures in the bispectrum\nof the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). The subsequent evolution of\nperturbations in the superhorizon epoch is then considered, via a covariant\nextension of the transport formalism. To develop intuition about the\nrelationship between inflationary dynamics and the evolution of cosmic\nobservables, we investigate analytic approximations of superhorizon\nperturbation evolution. The validity of these analytic results is contingent on\nreaching a state of adiabaticity which we discuss and illustrate in depth. We\nthen apply our analytic methods to elucidate the types of inflationary dynamics\nthat lead to an enhanced CMB non-Gaussianity, both in its bispectrum and\ntrispectrum. In addition to deriving a number of new simple relations between\nthe non-Gaussianity parameters, we explain dynamically how and why different\nshapes of inflationary potential lead to particular observational signatures.\nCandidate theories of high energy physics such as low energy effective string\ntheory also motivate single-field modifications to the Einstein-Hilbert action.\nWe show how a range of such corrections allow for consistency of single-field\nchaotic inflationary models that are otherwise in tension with observational\ndata.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Aug 2013 15:27:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-05"}
