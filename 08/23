Because the model neglects\nvarious other processes, the results presented are upper limits. We find that\nclouds with $\\Mmax \\lesssim 10^4 \\Msun$ end their lives with a mini-burst, at\nwhich the SFR reaches a peak of $\\sim 10^4 ~\\Msun \\Myr^{-1}$, although its time\naverage is only $\\SFRavg \\sim \\hbox{ a few} \\times 10^2 \\Msun \\Myr^{-1}$.

For more massive clouds ($\\Mmax \\gtrsim 10^5 ~ \\Msun$), the SFR first\nincreases and then remains roughly constant for $\\sim 10^7$ yr, because the\nclouds are influenced by the stellar feedback since earlier in their evolution.\nWe find that $\\SFRavg$ and $\\SFEavg$ are well represented by the fits $\\SFRavg\n\\approx 100 (1+\\Mmax/2 \\times 10^5 ~ \\Msun)^{2} ~ \\Msun \\Myr^{-1}$ and $\\SFEavg\n\\approx 0.024 (\\Mmax/10^5 ~ \\Msun)^{0.28}$, respectively. The massive model\nclouds follow the SFR-dense gas mass relation obtained by Gao \\& Solomon for\ninfrared galaxies, extrapolated down to MCs scales. Low-mass clouds fall above\nthis relation, in agreement with recent observations. An integration of the\nmodel-predicted $\\SFRavg$ over a Galactic GMC mass spectrum yields a realistic\nvalue for the Galactic SFR. Our results reinforce the suggestion that\nstar-forming GMCs may be in global collapse, and still have low net SFRs and\nSFEs, due to the evaporation of most of the cloud material by the feedback from\nmassive stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Aug 2013 17:05:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Nov 2013 20:02:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 23 Jul 2014 19:04:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

We show that for each triplet\n$(k,r,N)$, there exist admissibility conditions on the indexing sets, called\nsuperpartitions, that guaranty both the regularity and the uniqueness of the\npolynomials. These conditions are also used to establish similar properties for\nnon-symmetric Jack polynomials. As a result, we prove that the Jack polynomials\nwith arbitrary prescribed symmetry, indexed by $(k,r,N)$-admissible\nsuperpartitions, admit clusters of size $k=1$ and order $r\\geq 2$. In the last\npart of the article, we find necessary and sufficient conditions for the\ninvariance under translation of the Jack polynomials with prescribed symmetry\nAS. This allows to find special families of superpartitions that imply the\nexistence of clusters of size $k>1$ and order $r\\geq 2$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Aug 2013 17:46:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-28"}

On\nthe one hand, scans for positive selection have identified hundreds of\ncandidate loci and the genome-wide patterns of polymorphism show signatures\nconsistent with frequent positive selection. On the other hand, recent studies\nhave argued that many of the candidate loci are false positives and that most\napparent genome-wide signatures of adaptation are in fact due to reduction of\nneutral diversity by linked recurrent deleterious mutations, known as\nbackground selection. Here we analyze human polymorphism data from the 1,000\nGenomes project (Abecasis et al. 2012) and detect signatures of pervasive\npositive selection once we correct for the effects of background selection. We\nshow that levels of neutral polymorphism are lower near amino acid\nsubstitutions, with the strongest reduction observed specifically near\nfunctionally consequential amino acid substitutions. Furthermore, amino acid\nsubstitutions are associated with signatures of recent adaptation that should\nnot be generated by background selection, such as the presence of unusually\nlong and frequent haplotypes and specific distortions in the site frequency\nspectrum. We use forward simulations to show that the observed signatures\nrequire a high rate of strongly adaptive substitutions in the vicinity of the\namino acid changes. We further demonstrate that the observed signatures of\npositive selection correlate more strongly with the presence of regulatory\nsequences, as predicted by ENCODE (Gerstein et al. 2012), than the positions of\namino acid substitutions. Our results establish that adaptation was frequent in\nhuman evolution and provide support for the hypothesis of King and Wilson (King\nand Wilson 1975) that adaptive divergence is primarily driven by regulatory\nchanges.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Aug 2013 18:38:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-23"}

Radio timing\nindicates that the pulsar has a circular orbit with a 15 hr orbital period, a\nlow-mass companion, and a measurable orbital period derivative. The eclipse\nfraction of ~15% during the pulsar's orbit is twice the Roche lobe size\ninferred for the companion. The timing behavior is significantly affected by\nunmodeled systematics of astrophysical origin, and higher-order orbital period\nderivatives are needed in the timing solution to account for these variations.\nWe have identified the pulsar's (non-degenerate) companion using archival\nultraviolet, optical, and infrared survey data and new optical photometry.\nDoppler shifts from optical spectroscopy confirm the star's association with\nthe pulsar and indicate a pulsar-to-companion mass ratio of 3.3 +/- 0.5,\ncorresponding to a companion mass range of 0.4 to 0.7 Msun and an orbital\ninclination angle range of between 30 and 41 degrees, assuming a pulsar mass\nrange of 1.4-2.0 Msun.

With the arrival of new transit\nspectroscopy and direct imaging facilities, the question of molecular\ndetectability as a function of signal-to-noise (SNR), spectral resolving power\nand type of planets has become critical. In this paper, we study the\ndetectability of key molecules in the atmospheres of a range of planet types,\nand report on the minimum detectable abundances at fixed spectral resolving\npower and SNR. The planet types considered - hot Jupiters, hot super-Earths,\nwarm Neptunes, temperate Jupiters and temperate super-Earths - cover most of\nthe exoplanets characterisable today or in the near future. We focus on key\natmospheric molecules, such as CH4, CO, CO2, NH3, H2O, C2H2, C2H6, HCN, H2S and\nPH3. We use two methods to assess the detectability of these molecules: a\nsimple measurement of the deviation of the signal from the continuum, and an\nestimate of the level of confidence of a detection through the use of the\nlikelihood ratio test over the whole spectrum (from 1 to 16$\\mu m$). We find\nthat for most planetary cases, SNR=5 at resolution R=300 ($\\lambda < 5\\mu m$)\nand R=30 ($\\lambda > 5\\mu m$) is enough to detect the very strongest spectral\nfeatures for the most abundant molecules, whereas an SNR comprised between 10\nand 20 can reveal most molecules with abundances 10^-6 or lower, often at\nmultiple wavelengths. We test the robustness of our results by exploring\nsensitivity to parameters such as vertical thermal profile, mean molecular\nweight of the atmosphere and relative water abundances. We find that our main\nconclusions remain valid except for the most extreme cases.

This behaviour can be understood in the magnetar\nmodel, according to which these sources are mainly powered by their own\nmagnetic energy. This is supported by the fact that the magnetic fields\ninferred from several observed properties of AXPs and SGRs are greater than -\nor at the high end of the range of - those of radio pulsars. In the peculiar\ncase of SGR 0418+5729, a weak dipole magnetic moment is derived from its timing\nparameters, whereas a strong field has been proposed to reside in the stellar\ninterior and in multipole components on the surface. Here we show that the\nX-ray spectrum of SGR 0418+5729 has an absorption line, the properties of which\ndepend strongly on the star's rotational phase. This line is interpreted as a\nproton cyclotron feature and its energy implies a magnetic field ranging from\n2E14 gauss to more than 1E15 gauss.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Aug 2013 20:16:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-26"}

Precisely\nspeaking, we consider both as linear time-invariant systems by appropriately\nrestricting channels and coding schemes of network coding to be linear\ntime-invariant, and the plant and controllers of decentralized control to be\nlinear time-invariant as well. First, we apply linear system theory to network\ncoding. This gives a novel way of converting an arbitrary relay network to an\nequivalent acyclic single-hop relay network, which we call Network\nLinearization. Based on network linearization, we prove that the fundamental\ndesign limit, mincut, is achievable by a linear time-invariant network-coding\nscheme regardless of the network topology.\n  Then, we use the network-coding to view decentralized linear systems. We\nargue that linear time-invariant controllers in a decentralized linear system\n\"communicate\" via linear network coding to stabilize the plant. To justify this\nargument, we give an algorithm to \"externalize\" the implicit communication\nbetween the controllers that we believe must be occurring to stabilize the\nplant. Based on this, we show that the stabilizability condition for\ndecentralized linear systems comes from an underlying communication limit,\nwhich can be described by the algebraic mincut-maxflow theorem.

Networks that support bump attractors\nare often used to model such persistent activity. Such models usually exhibit\ntranslational symmetry. Thus activity bumps are neutrally stable, and\nperturbations in position do not decay away. We extend previous work on bump\nattractors by constructing model networks capable of encoding the certainty or\nsalience of a stimulus stored in memory. Such networks support bumps that are\nnot only neutrally stable to perturbations in position, but also perturbations\nin amplitude. Possible bump solutions then lie on a two-dimensional attractor,\ndetermined by a continuum of positions and amplitudes. Such an attractor\nrequires precisely balancing the strength of recurrent synaptic connections.\nThe amplitude of activity bumps represents certainty, and is determined by the\ninitial input to the system. Moreover, bumps with larger amplitudes are more\nrobust to noise, and over time provide a more faithful representation of the\nstored stimulus. In networks with separate excitatory and inhibitory\npopulations, generating bumps with a continuum of possible amplitudes, requires\ntuning the strength of inhibition to precisely cancel background excitation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Aug 2013 05:20:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-26"}

Equipped\nwith a rechargeable battery, a source node can harvest energy from ambient\nenvironments and rely on this free and regenerative energy supply to transmit\npackets. Due to the uncertainty of available energy from harvesting, however,\nintolerably large latency and packet loss could be induced, if the source\nalways waits for harvested energy. To overcome this problem, one Reliable\nEnergy Source (RES) can be resorted to for a prompt delivery of backlogged\npackets. Naturally, there exists a tradeoff between the packet delivery delay\nand power consumption from the RES. In this paper, we address the delay optimal\nscheduling problem for a bursty communication link powered by a\ncapacity-limited battery storing harvested energy together with one RES. The\nproposed scheduling scheme gives priority to the usage of harvested energy, and\nresorts to the RES when necessary based on the data and energy queueing\nprocesses, with an average power constraint from the RES. Through\ntwodimensional Markov chain modeling and linear programming formulation, we\nderive the optimal threshold-based scheduling policy together with the\ncorresponding transmission parameters.

Our goal is to\ninvestigate the degree of chemical complexity that can be reached in the ISM.\nWe performed an unbiased, spectral line survey toward Sgr B2(N) and (M) with\nthe IRAM 30m telescope in the 3mm window. The spectra were analyzed with a\nsimple radiative transfer model that assumes LTE but takes optical depth\neffects into account. About 3675 and 945 spectral lines with a peak\nsignal-to-noise ratio higher than 4 are detected toward N and M, i.e. about 102\nand 26 lines per GHz, respectively. This represents an increase by about a\nfactor of 2 over previous surveys of Sgr B2. About 70% and 47% of the lines\ndetected toward N and M are identified and assigned to 56 and 46 distinct\nmolecules as well as to 66 and 54 less abundant isotopologues of these\nmolecules, respectively. We also report the detection of transitions from 59\nand 24 catalog entries corresponding to vibrationally or torsionally excited\nstates of some of these molecules, respectively. Excitation temperatures and\ncolumn densities were derived for each species but should be used with caution.\nAmong the detected molecules, aminoacetonitrile, n-propyl cyanide, and ethyl\nformate were reported for the first time in space based on this survey, as were\n5 rare isotopologues of vinyl cyanide, cyanoacetylene, and hydrogen cyanide. We\nalso report the detection of transitions from within 12 new vib. or tors.\nexcited states of known molecules. Although the large number of unidentified\nlines may still allow future identification of new molecules, we expect most of\nthese lines to belong to vib. or tors. excited states or to rare isotopologues\nof known molecules for which spectroscopic predictions are currently missing.\n(abridged)\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Aug 2013 07:25:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-25"}

Thanks to the excellent sensitivity of the SDSS\nspectroscopic surveys, this is by far the deepest search for PNe ever taken,\nreaching a surface brightness of the [OIII] 5007 line down to about 29.0\nmag./arcsec^2. The search recovers 13 previously known PNe in the Galactic\nCaps. In total, 44 new PN candidates are identified, including 7 candidates of\nmultiple detections and 37 candidates of single detection. The 7 candidates of\nmultiple detections are all extremely large (between 21' - 154') and faint,\nlocated mostly in the low Galactic latitude region and with a kinematics\nsimilar to disk stars. After checking their images in Ha and other bands, three\nof them are probably HII regions, one is probably associated with a new\nsupernova remnant, another one is possibly a true PN, and the remaining two\ncould be either PNe or supernova remnants. Based on sky positions and\nkinematics, 7 candidates of single detection probably belong to the halo\npopulation. If confirmed, they will increase the number of known PNe in the\nGalactic halo significantly. All the newly identified PN candidates are very\nfaint, with a surface brightness of the [OIII] 5007 line between 27.0 - 30.0\nmag./arcsec^2, very challenging to be discovered with previous techniques and\nthus may greatly increase the number of \"missing\" faint PNe.

Combining the large\nspectral databases provided by the SDSS and other on-going projects (e.g. the\nLAMOST Galactic surveys), it is possible to build a statistically meaningful\nsample of ultra-faint, large, evolved PNe, thus improving the census of\nGalactic PNe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Aug 2013 08:25:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

We show that 1-visibility properly extends 1-planarity and develop\na linear time algorithm to compute a 1-visibility representation of an embedded\n1-planar graph on O(n^2) area. A graph is 1-planar if it can be drawn in the\nplane such that each edge is crossed at most once. Concerning density, both\n1-visible and 1-planar graphs of size $n$ have at most 4n-8 edges. However, for\nevery n >= 7 there are 1-visible graphs with 4n-8 edge which are not 1-planar.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Aug 2013 09:30:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-26"}

The most prominent sources\nof this system are a quasar and a submillimeter galaxy, separated by a\nprojected distance of about 24 kpc and characterized by very high SFR, higher\nthan 1000 Msun/yr. However, the ALMA observations reveal that these galaxies\napparently have undisturbed rotating disks, which is at variance with the\ncommonly accepted scenario in which strong star formation activity is induced\nby a major merger. We also detected faint components which, after spectral\ndeblending, were spatially resolved from the main QSO and SMG emissions. The\nrelative velocities and positions of these components are compatible with\norbital motions within the gravitational potentials generated by the QSO host\ngalaxy and the SMG, suggesting that they are smaller galaxies in interaction or\ngas clouds in accretion flows of tidal streams. We did not find any clear\nspectral evidence for outflows caused by AGN or stellar feedback. This suggests\nthat the high star formation rates might be induced by interactions or minor\nmergers with these companions, which do not affect the large-scale kinematics\nof the disks, however. Our kinematical analysis also indicates that the QSO and\nthe SMG have similar Mdyn, mostly in the form of molecular gas, and that the\nQSO host galaxy and the SMG are seen close to face-on with slightly different\ndisk inclinations: the QSO host galaxy is seen almost face-on (i~15), while the\nSMG is seen at higher inclinations (i~25). Finally, the ratio between the black\nhole mass of the QSO, obtained from XShooter spectroscopy, and the Mdyn of the\nhost galaxy is similar to value found in very massive local galaxies,\nsuggesting that the evolution of black hole galaxy relations is probably better\nstudied with dynamical than with stellar host galaxy masses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Aug 2013 12:32:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

The velocity profile\naround protostars is poorly constrained. 6 Class 0 protostars and one Class I\nprotostars observed with HIFI on board Herschel as part of the \"Water in\nstar-forming regions with Herschel\" (WISH) survey show infall signatures in\nwater line observations. We use 1-D non-LTE RATRAN radiative transfer models of\nthe observed water lines to constrain the infall velocity and chemistry in the\nprotostellar envelopes of these sources. We assume a free-fall velocity profile\nand, having found the best fit, vary the radii over which infall takes place.\nIn the well-studied Class 0 protostar NGC1333-IRAS4A we find that infall takes\nplace over the whole envelope to which our observations are sensitive (r>~1000\nAU). For 4 sources infall takes place on core to envelope scales (i.e.\n~10000-3000 AU). In 2 sources the inverse P-Cygni profiles seen in the\nground-state lines are more likely due to larger-scale motions or foreground\nclouds. Models including a simple consideration of the chemistry are consistent\nwith the observations, while using step abundance profiles are not. The\nnon-detection of excited water in the inner envelope in 6/7 protostars is\nfurther evidence that water must be heavily depleted from the gas-phase at\nthese radii. Infall in four of the sources is supersonic and infall in all\nsources must take place at the outer edge of the envelope, which may be\nevidence that collapse is global or outside-in rather than inside-out. The mass\ninfall rate in IRAS4A is large (>~10^-4 msol\\yr), higher than the mass outflow\nrate and expected mass accretion rates onto the star, suggesting that any\nflattened disk-like structure on small scales will be gravitationally unstable,\npotentially leading to rotational fragmentation and/or episodic accretion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Aug 2013 13:03:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 Sep 2013 14:21:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 12 Oct 2013 16:13:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

A couple of groups, Busha et al. 2003 (B03) and\nDunner et al. 2006 (D06), have attempted to analytically define these limits,\narriving at substantially different estimates due to differences in their\nassumptions about the velocities at the present epoch. In an effort to locate\nthe largest bound structures in the universe, we selected the Aquarius (ASC),\nMicroscopium (MSC), Corona Borealis (CBSC), and Shapley (SSC) superclusters for\nstudy, due to their high number density of rich Abell clusters. Simple N-body\nsimulations, which assumed negligible intercluster mass, were used to assess\nthe likelihood of these structures being gravitationally bound, and the\npredictions of the models of B03 and D06 were compared with those results. We\nfind that ASC, and MSC contain pairs of clusters which are gravitationally\nbound, A2541/A2546 and A3695/A3696 respectively, with no other structures\nhaving a significant chance of being bound. For SSC, we find a group of five\nclusters, A3554, A3556, A3558, A3560, and A3562 that are bound, with an\nadditional pair, A1736/A3559, having a slight chance of being bound. We find\nthat CBSC has no extended bound structure, contrary to the findings of Small et\nal. 1998, who claim that the entire supercluster is bound. In regards to the\nanalytical models, we find that B03 will identify structure that is definitely\nbound, but tends to underestimate the true extent of the structure, while D06\nwill identify all structure that is bound while overestimating its extent.\nCombined, the two models can provide lower and upper limits to the extent of\nbound structures so long as there are no other significant structures nearby or\nno significant dark matter exterior to the clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Aug 2013 15:18:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

The results are obtained from an\nalgorithm that minimizes an ad-hoc cost function, and then compared to the\nequivalent dose computed using standard calculators in seven French\nradiotherapy centers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Aug 2013 12:08:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-28"}

For a nuclear fission reactor to exist at the center of the\nEarth, all of the following conditions must be met: (1) There must originally\nhave been a substantial quantity of uranium within Earth's core; (2) There must\nbe a natural mechanism for concentrating the uranium; (3) The isotopic\ncomposition of the uranium at the onset of fission must be appropriate to\nsustain a nuclear fission chain reaction; (4) The reactor must be able to breed\na sufficient quantity of fissile nuclides to permit operation over the lifetime\nof Earth to the present; (5) There must be a natural mechanism for the removal\nof fission products; (6) There must be a natural mechanism for removing heat\nfrom the reactor; (7) There must be a natural mechanism to regulate reactor\npower level, and; (8) The location of the reactor or must be such as to provide\ncontainment and prevent meltdown. Herndon's georeactor alone is shown to meet\nthose conditions. Georeactor existence evidence based upon helium measurements\nand upon antineutrino measurements is described. Geophysical implications\ndiscussed include georeactor origin of the geomagnetic field, geomagnetic\nreversals from intense solar outbursts and severe Earth trauma, as well as\ngeoreactor heat contributions to global dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Aug 2013 14:39:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 31 Dec 2013 18:27:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-03"}

However, for various reasons,\nmany established protocols (e.g. de facto Internet inter-domain routing\nprotocol, Border-Gateway Protocol - BGP) do not fully exploit such alternate\npaths. This paper surveys research into techniques for discovering end-to-end\nalternate paths, including those based on monitoring path performance, choosing\npaths that are maximally disjoint, and in routing across multiple paths. It\nsurveys proposals for making BGP better able to exploit multiple paths and how\nmulti-homing can create alternate paths. It also describes how alternate paths\ncan be realized through detour routing (application layer mechanisms) and\nrouting deflections (network layer mechanisms). It also discusses Fast Re-Route\ntechniques for construction of backup routes. It concludes by surveying open\nresearch issues into the discovery and use of alternate paths in the Internet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Aug 2013 07:55:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-31"}

In the collective oscillation\nof supernova neutrino the self energy is not a constant but varies\nadiabatically, which is responsible to have such different phases. In this\narticle the transition point from synchronized oscillation to bipolar phase is\nstudied numerically as well as analytically. The numerical results yielding\ndifferent graphs depending on different values of possible small but\nnon-vanishing mixing angles show the onset of the bipolar phase from the\nsynchronized phase varies as the mixing angle. But the analytical study in\nterms of a spinning top model results a unique onset condition, which is\nindependent of the choice of mixing angle.
