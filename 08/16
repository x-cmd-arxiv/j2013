For strong\nresonance lines partial frequency redistribution (PRD) effects also become\nimportant. In a series of papers we have been investigating the nature of\nStokes profiles formed in multi-D media including PRD in line scattering. For\nnumerical simplicity so far we restricted our attention to the particular case\nof PRD functions which are averaged over all the incident and scattered\ndirections. In this paper we formulate the polarized RT equation in multi-D\nmedia that takes into account Hanle effect with angle-dependent PRD functions.\nWe generalize here to the multi-D case, the method of Fourier series expansion\nof angle-dependent PRD functions originally developed for RT in 1D geometry. We\nshow that the Stokes source vector $\\bm{S}=(S_I,S_Q,S_U)^T$ and the Stokes\nvector $\\bm{I}=(I,Q,U)^T$ can be expanded in terms of infinite sets of\ncomponents ${\\tilde{\\bm{\\mathcal{S}}}}^{(k)}$,\n${\\tilde{\\bm{\\mathcal{I}}}}^{(k)}$ respectively, $k\\in[0,+\\infty)$. We show\nthat the components ${\\tilde{\\bm{\\mathcal{S}}}}^{(k)}$ become independent of\nthe azimuthal angle ($\\varphi$) of the scattered ray, whereas the components\n${\\tilde{\\bm{\\mathcal{I}}}}^{(k)}$ remain dependent on $\\varphi$ due to the\nnature of RT in multi-D geometry. We also establish that\n${\\tilde{\\bm{\\mathcal{S}}}}^{(k)}$ and ${\\tilde{\\bm{\\mathcal{I}}}}^{(k)}$\nsatisfy a simple transfer equation, which can be solved by any iterative method\nlike an Approximate Lambda Iteration (ALI) or a Biconjugate-Gradient type\nprojection method provided we truncate the Fourier series to have a finite\nnumber of terms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Aug 2013 16:00:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-16"}

Among the\nforbidden theories is a subset of outcome dependent theories showing that\noutcome dependence is not sufficient for explaining a violation of Bell\ninequalities. Non-local theories which can violate Bell inequalities (among\nthem quantum theory) are rather characterised by the fact that at least one of\nthe measurement outcomes in some sense (which is made precise)\nprobabilistically depends both on its local as well as on its distant\nmeasurement setting ('parameter').

This class of models provides a\nstraightforward way of modeling normal and non-normal data and has been widely\nused in several practical situations. The likelihood ratio, Wald and score\nstatistics, and the recently proposed gradient statistic provide the basis for\ntesting inference on the parameters in these models. We focus on the\nsmall-sample case, where the reference chi-squared distribution gives a poor\napproximation to the true null distribution of these test statistics. We derive\na general Bartlett-type correction factor in matrix notation for the gradient\ntest which reduces the size distortion of the test, and numerically compare the\nproposed test with the usual likelihood ratio, Wald, score and gradient tests,\nand with the Bartlett-corrected likelihood ratio and score tests. Our\nsimulation results suggest that the corrected test we propose can be an\ninteresting alternative to the other tests since it leads to very accurate\ninference even for very small samples. We also present an empirical application\nfor illustrative purposes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Aug 2013 18:04:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-16"}

Within standard paradigms, it is non-trivial to realize a\nmini-split spectrum with heavier sfermions but lighter gauginos while\nsimultaneously generating Higgs sector soft terms of the correct magnitude,\nsuggesting the need for new models of supersymmetry breaking and mediation. In\nthis paper, we present a new approach to mini-split model building based on\ngauge mediation by ``auxiliary groups'', which are the anomaly-free continuous\nsymmetries of the standard model in the limit of vanishing Yukawa couplings. In\naddition to the well-known flavor SU(3)_F and baryon-minus-lepton U(1)_{B-L}\ngroups, we find that an additional U(1)_H acting on the Higgs doublets alone\ncan be used to generate Higgs soft masses and B-terms necessary for a complete\nmodel of mini-split. Auxiliary gauge mediation is a special case of Higgsed\ngauge mediation, and we review the resulting two-loop scalar soft terms as well\nas three-loop gaugino masses. Along the way, we present a complete two-loop\ncalculation of A-terms and B-terms in gauge mediation, which---contrary to a\ncommon misconception---includes a non-zero contribution at the messenger\nthreshold which can be sizable in models with light gauginos. We present\nseveral phenomenologically acceptable mini-split spectra arising from auxiliary\ngauge mediation and highlight a complete minimal model which realizes the\nrequired spectrum and Higgs sector soft terms with a single U(1)_X auxiliary\ngauge symmetry.

It is still not clear whether they host an AGN in a low\naccretion mode, or whether they are not active at all but dominated by\nalternative ionization mechanisms, namely shocks, winds/outflows, or\nphotoionization by a post asymptotic giant branch (p-AGB) stellar population.\nThe detection of extended LINER-like emission was often taken as evidence of\nionization by stellar components but this has not been undisputed. We performed\noptical integral field spectroscopic observations on the central approx. 4 kpc\nof NGC 5850 using VIMOS at the VLT, which provides spatially-resolved spectra\nfor the gas emission and the stellar continuum. We derive and analyse emission\nline and kinematic maps. We find the central few kpc of NGC 5850 to be\ndominated by extended LINER-like emission. The emission-line ratios that are\nsensitive to the ionization parameter increase with radial distance to the\nnucleus. Therefore, the extended LINER-like emission in NGC 5850 is dominated\nby ionization from distributed ionization sources, probably by stars on the\np-AGB. The LINER-like region is surrounded by emission that is classed as\n'composite', likely due to a mixture of a LINER-like ionization pattern and\nphotoionization by low-level star formation. Two star-forming regions are\npresent in the 21\"x19\" field of view. One of them is located approximately in\nthe ring surrounding the kinematically decoupled core. The second one is close\nto the nucleus and is the origin of a region of decreased emission line ratios\noriented radially outwards. We find the interstellar gas to have areas of steep\nvelocity gradients and a complex kinematic morphology, probably caused by the\nlopsided (m=1) distribution of the gas.

The underlying mechanism, unrelated to the chaotic motion in the\nclassical limit but resting on quasi-integrable motion in a pseudoclassical\nlimit, is identified for one special case.

The\npresence of a quantum critical point manifests itself in the finite-T physical\nproperties, and often gives rise to new states of matter. Superconductivity in\nthe cuprates and in heavy fermion materials is believed by many to be mediated\nby fluctuations associated with a quantum critical point. In the\nrecently-discovered iron-pnictide high temperature superconductors, it is\nunknown whether a QCP exists or not in a carrier-doped system. Here we report\ntransport and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements on\nBaFe_{2-x}Ni_xAs_2 (0 =< x =< 0.17). We find two critical points at x_{c1} =\n0.10 and x_{c2} = 0.14. The electrical resistivity follows \\rho = \\rho_0 +\nA*T^n, with n = 1 around x_{c1} and another minimal n = 1.1 at x_{c2}. By NMR\nmeasurements, we identity x_{c1} to be a magnetic QCP and suggest that x_{c2}\nis a new type of QCP associated with a nematic structural phase transition. Our\nresults suggest that the superconductivity in carrier-doped pnictides is\nclosely linked to the quantum criticality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Aug 2013 02:50:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-19"}

One popular method, known as maximally informative dimensions\n(MID), uses an information-theoretic quantity known as \"single-spike\ninformation\" to identify this space. Here we examine MID from a model-based\nperspective. We show that MID is a maximum-likelihood estimator for the\nparameters of a linear-nonlinear-Poisson (LNP) model, and that the empirical\nsingle-spike information corresponds to the normalized log-likelihood under a\nPoisson model. This equivalence implies that MID does not necessarily find\nmaximally informative stimulus dimensions when spiking is not well described as\nPoisson. We provide several examples to illustrate this shortcoming, and derive\na lower bound on the information lost when spiking is Bernoulli in discrete\ntime bins. To overcome this limitation, we introduce model-based dimensionality\nreduction methods for neurons with non-Poisson firing statistics, and show that\nthey can be framed equivalently in likelihood-based or information-theoretic\nterms. Finally, we show how to overcome practical limitations on the number of\nstimulus dimensions that MID can estimate by constraining the form of the\nnon-parametric nonlinearity in an LNP model.

In order to produce the\nobserved non-thermal spectra, some kind of dissipation mechanism near the\nphotosphere is required. In this paper we numerically simulate the evolution of\nthe photon spectrum in a relativistically expanding shell with a time-dependent\nnumerical code. We consider two basic models. One is a leptonic model, where a\ndissipation mechanism heats the thermal electrons maintaining their high\ntemperature. The other model involves a cascade process induced by\n$pp$($pn$)-collisions which produce high-energy electrons, modify the thermal\nspectrum, and emit neutrinos. The qualitative properties of the photon spectra\nare mainly determined by the optical depth at which the dissipation mechanism\nsets in. Too large optical depths lead to a broad and curved spectrum\ncontradicting the observations, while for optical depths smaller than unity the\nspectral hardness becomes softer than observed. A significant shift of the\nspectral peak energy to higher energies due to a large energy injection can\nlead to an overly broad spectral shape. We show ideal parameter ranges for\nwhich these models are able to reproduce the observed spectra. For the\n$pn$-collision model, the neutrino fluence in the 10-100 GeV range is well\nabove the atmospheric neutrino fluence, but its detection is challenging for\npresently available detectors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Aug 2013 06:28:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

The method\nis relevant for both real-time applications and in more traditional scenarios\nwhere the generation of waveforms using standard methods can be prohibitively\nexpensive. Our approach is based on three offline steps resulting in an\naccurate reduced-order model that can be used as a surrogate for the\ntrue/fiducial waveform family. First, a set of m parameter values is determined\nusing a greedy algorithm from which a reduced basis representation is\nconstructed. Second, these m parameters induce the selection of m time values\nfor interpolating a waveform time series using an empirical interpolant. Third,\na fit in the parameter dimension is performed for the waveform's value at each\nof these m times. The cost of predicting L waveform time samples for a generic\nparameter choice is of order m L + m c_f online operations where c_f denotes\nthe fitting function operation count and, typically, m << L. We generate\naccurate surrogate models for Effective One Body (EOB) waveforms of\nnon-spinning binary black hole coalescences with durations as long as 10^5 M,\nmass ratios from 1 to 10, and for multiple harmonic modes. We find that these\nsurrogates are three orders of magnitude faster to evaluate as compared to the\ncost of generating EOB waveforms in standard ways. Surrogate model building for\nother waveform models follow the same steps and have the same low online\nscaling cost. For expensive numerical simulations of binary black hole\ncoalescences we thus anticipate large speedups in generating new waveforms with\na surrogate. As waveform generation is one of the dominant costs in parameter\nestimation algorithms and parameter space exploration, surrogate models offer a\nnew and practical way to dramatically accelerate such studies without impacting\naccuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Aug 2013 07:13:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 28 Feb 2014 03:21:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-23"}

The underlying assumption is that electrons are in their\nquantum-mechanical ground state or in thermal equilibrium. However, there is an\nabundance of cases where this is unjustified because the system is only locally\nin equilibrium. In particular, the fractional charges of atoms, clusters, or\nsolids tend to not only depend on atomic positions but also on how the system\nreached its state. For example, the charge of an isolated solid -- and thus the\nforces between atoms in that solid -- usually depends on the counterbody with\nwhich it has last formed contact. Similarly, the charge of an atom, resulting\nfrom the dissociation of a molecule, can differ for different solvents in which\nthe dissociation took place. In this paper we demonstrate that such\ncharge-transfer history effects can be accounted for by assigning discrete\noxidation states to atoms. With our method, an atom can donate an integer\ncharge to another, nearby atom to change its oxidation state as in a redox\nreaction. In addition to integer charges, atoms can exchange \"partial charges\"\nwhich are determined with the split charge equilibration method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Aug 2013 08:05:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-19"}

However, an attempt has been made\nto explain the role of cilia motion on the transport of fluid through the\nductus efferentes of the male reproductive tract. Ostwald-de Waele power-law\nviscous fluid has been considered to represent the rheological fluid. To\nanalyze pumping by means of a sequence of beat of cilia from row-to-row of\ncilia in a given row of cells and from one row of cells to the next\n(metachronal wave movement), we consider the conditions that the corresponding\nReynolds number is small enough for inertial effects to be negligible and the\nwavelength to diameter ratio is large enough for the pressure to be considered\nuniform over the cross-section. Analyses and computations of the detailed fluid\nmotion reveal that the time-averaged flow rate is dependent on $\\epsilon$, a\nnon-dimensional measure involving the mean radius $a$ of the tube and the cilia\nlength. Thus, flow rate significantly varies with the cilia length. Moreover,\nthe flow rate has been reported near to the estimated value $6\\times\n10^{-3}$$ml/h$ for human efferent ducts if $\\epsilon$ is near by 0.4. The\nestimated value was suggested by Lardner and Shack [1] in human, based on the\nexperimental observations for flow rates in efferent ducts of other animals,\ne.g., rat, ram and bull. In addition, the nature of the rheological fluid,\ni.e., the value of the fluid index $n$ strongly influences various\nflow-governed characteristics.

Risk\nportfolios may consist of thousands of reinsurance contracts covering millions\nof insured locations. To quantify risk each portfolio must be evaluated in up\nto a million simulation trials, each capturing a different possible sequence of\ncatastrophic events over the course of a contractual year. In this paper, we\nexplore the design of a flexible framework for portfolio risk analysis that\nfacilitates answering a rich variety of catastrophic risk queries. Rather than\naggregating simulation data in order to produce a small set of high-level risk\nmetrics efficiently (as is often done in production risk management systems),\nthe focus here is on allowing the user to pose queries on unaggregated or\npartially aggregated data. The goal is to provide a flexible framework that can\nbe used by analysts to answer a wide variety of unanticipated but natural ad\nhoc queries. Such detailed queries can help actuaries or underwriters to better\nunderstand the multiple dimensions (e.g., spatial correlation, seasonality,\nperil features, construction features, and financial terms) that can impact\nportfolio risk. We implemented a prototype system, called QuPARA (Query-Driven\nLarge-Scale Portfolio Aggregate Risk Analysis), using Hadoop, which is Apache's\nimplementation of the MapReduce paradigm. This allows the user to take\nadvantage of large parallel compute servers in order to answer ad hoc risk\nanalysis queries efficiently even on very large data sets typically encountered\nin practice. We describe the design and implementation of QuPARA and present\nexperimental results that demonstrate its feasibility. A full portfolio risk\nanalysis run consisting of a 1,000,000 trial simulation, with 1,000 events per\ntrial, and 3,200 risk transfer contracts can be completed on a 16-node Hadoop\ncluster in just over 20 minutes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Aug 2013 12:15:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-18"}

However, raw seismic traces contain\nintermittent large-amplitude perturbations arising from tectonic activity and\ninstrumental errors, which may corrupt the estimated cross-correlations of\nmicroseismic fluctuations. In order to diminish the impact of these\nperturbations, the recorded traces are filtered using the nonlinear one-bit\ndigitizer, which replaces the measurement by its sign.

We find that\nEDM searches will be a robust probe of models in which fermion masses are\ngenerated radiatively, while LFV searches remain sensitive to simple-texture\nbased flavor models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Aug 2013 15:31:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Sep 2013 01:19:45 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 12 Nov 2015 16:50:34 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 12 Apr 2016 17:37:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-13"}

We find a total of 35 viable models, most of\nwhich have not been previously studied in the literature. There is a great\npotential to test these models at the LHC not only due to the TeV-scale masses\nof the new fields but also because about half of the viable models contain\nparticles with exotic electric charges, which give rise to background-free\nsignals.

We observe significant\nsuppression of the scintillation light yield by dissolved methane at the 10\npart per billion (ppb) level.

It is well known that a bullet\ncan tumble for stability less than 1.0. The Sierra Loading Manuals (4th and 5th\nEditions) have previously reported that ballistic coefficient decreases\nsignificantly as gyroscopic stability, Sg, is lowered below 1.3. These\nobservations are further confirmed by experiments reported here. Measured\nballistic coefficients were compared with gyroscopic stabilities computed using\nthe Miller Twist Rule for nearly solid metal bullets with uniform density and\ncomputed using the Courtney-Miller formula for plastic-tipped bullets. The\nrelationship between Sg and drag may be used to test the applicability of\nexisting gyroscopic stability formulas for given bullet designs and to evaluate\nthe accuracy of alternate formulas in cases where the existing stability\nformulas are not as accurate. The most definitive test of formulas predicting\nstability will always be observation of whether bullets tumble under given\nconditions. However, observations of drag changes provide valuable supplemental\ninformation because they suggest changes in stability as conditions change. Use\nof a continuous variable (drag) rather than a binary variable (tumbling) allows\ninsight into stability over a range of conditions where the binary variable\ndoes not change.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Aug 2013 20:25:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Oct 2014 10:02:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-17"}
