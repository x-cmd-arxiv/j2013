For such models the standard policy iteration is known to\nhave difficult measurability issues and cannot be carried out in general. We\npresent a mixed value and policy iteration method that circumvents this\ndifficulty. The method allows the use of stationary policies in computing the\noptimal cost function, in a manner that resembles policy iteration. It can also\nbe used to address similar difficulties of policy iteration in the context of\nupper and lower semicontinuous models. We analyze the convergence of the method\nin infinite horizon total cost problems, for the discounted case where the\none-stage costs are bounded, and for the undiscounted case where the one-stage\ncosts are nonpositive or nonnegative.\n  For undiscounted total cost problems with nonnegative one-stage costs, we\nalso give a new convergence theorem for value iteration, which shows that value\niteration converges whenever it is initialized with a function that is above\nthe optimal cost function and yet bounded by a multiple of the optimal cost\nfunction. This condition resembles Whittle's bridging condition and is partly\nmotivated by it. The theorem is also partly motivated by a result of Maitra and\nSudderth, which showed that value iteration, when initialized with the constant\nfunction zero, could require a transfinite number of iterations to converge.

Unlike metro and backbone networks, however, access networks\ndirectly interface with end-users, so it is important to base the study and\ndesign of access networks on the behaviors of and the actual performance\nperceived by end-users. In this paper we study the effect of ISP traffic\nshaping using traffic models based on user behaviors and\napplication/session-layer metrics providing quantifiable measures of\nuser-perceived performance for HTTP, FTP, and streaming video traffic. To\ncompare the user-perceived performance of shaped traffic flows with those of\nunshaped ones in an integrated way, we use a multivariate non-inferiority\ntesting procedure. We first investigate the effect of the token generation rate\nand the token bucket size of a token bucket filter on user-perceived\nperformance at a subscriber level with a single subscriber. Then we investigate\ntheir effect at an access level where shaped traffic flows from multiple\nsubscribers interact with one another in a common shared access network. The\nsimulation results show that for a given token generation rate, a larger token\nbucket provides better user-perceived performance at both subscriber and access\nlevels. It is also shown that the loose burst control resulting from the large\ntoken bucket --- up to 100 MB for access line rate of 100 Mbit/s --- does not\nnegatively affect user-perceived performance with multiple subscribers even in\nthe presence of non-conformant subscribers; with a much larger token bucket,\nhowever, the negative effect of non-conformant subscribers on the\nuser-perceived performance of conformant subscribers becomes clearly visible\nbecause the impact of token bucket size and that of token generation rate are\nvirtually indistinguishable in this case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Aug 2013 10:17:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 Jun 2014 15:26:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-02"}

Basically, the observed cluster counts are significantly lower\nthan the prediction of the standard flat LambdaCDM model with the key\ncosmological parameters set at the Planck best-fit values. We show that this\ninconsistency between the local and the early universe can be well resolved\nwithout failing the currently favored flat LambdaCDM cosmology if the local\nuniverse corresponds to a region embedded in a crest of the primordial\ngravitational potential field. Incorporating the condition of positive\nprimordial potential into the theoretical prediction for the mass function of\ncluster halos, we show that the observed lower number densities of the galaxy\nclusters are in fact fully consistent with the Planck universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Aug 2013 15:32:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 Feb 2014 13:10:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}
