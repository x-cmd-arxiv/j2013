The temperature\ndependence of the superconducting gap observed in places with large and small\ngap size indicates that it is indeed the superconducting transition temperature\nwhich is inhomogeneous.

This is mainly due to the difficulty in\nformulating a computationally tractable model since rate matrices can no longer\nbe used. Here we introduce a general framework, based on factor graphs, for\nconstructing probabilistic models of protein evolution with site\ninterdependence. Conveniently, efficient approximate inference algorithms, like\nBelief Propagation, can be used to calculate likelihoods for these models. We\nfit an amino acid substitution model of this type that accounts for both\nsolvent accessibility and site-site correlations. Comparisons of the new model\nwith rate matrix models and a model accounting only for solvent accessibility\ndemonstrate that it better fits the sequence data. We also examine evolution\nwithin a family of homohexameric enzymes and find that site-site correlations\nbetween most contacting subunits contribute to a higher likelihood. In\naddition, we show that the new substitution model has a similar mathematical\nform to the one introduced in (Rodrigue et al. 2005), although with different\nparameter interpretations and values. We also perform a statistical analysis of\nthe effects of amino acids at neighboring sites on substitution probabilities\nand find a significant perturbation of most probabilities, further supporting\nthe significant role of site-site interactions in protein evolution and\nmotivating the development of new evolutionary models like the one described\nhere.

This model was used in the course of designing\nand setting of such a screen in LPMC. The PR-based screen compares favorably\nwith conventional types of such machines, where the transverse oscillations are\nexcited directly. It is characterized by larger values of the amplitude and by\ninsensitivity to damping in a rather wide range. The model represents an\ninitially strained system of two equal masses connected by a linearly elastic\nstring. Self-equilibrated, longitudinal, harmonic forces act on the masses.\nUnder certain conditions this results in transverse, finite-amplitude\noscillations of the string. The problem is reduced to a system of two ordinary\ndifferential equations coupled by the geometric nonlinearity. Damping in both\nthe transverse and longitudinal oscillations is taken into account. Free and\nforced oscillations of this mass-string system are examined analytically and\nnumerically. The energy exchange between the longitudinal and transverse modes\nof free oscillations is demonstrated. An exact analytical solution is found for\nthe forced oscillations, where the coupling plays the role of a stabilizer. In\na more general case, the harmonic analysis is used with neglect of the higher\nharmonics. Explicit expressions for all parameters of the steady nonlinear\noscillations are determined.

Thus, there is a need to explore ways in\nwhich MC questions can be utilized pedagogically more like CR questions while\nmaintaining their attendant procedural advantages. we describe how an\nanswer-until-correct MC response format allows for the construction of\nmultiple-choice examinations designed to operate much as a hybrid between\nstandard MC and CR testing. With this tool - the immediate feedback assessment\ntechnique (IF-AT) - students gain complete knowledge of the correct answer for\neach question during the examination, and can use such information for solving\nsubsequent test items. This feature allows for the creation of a new type of\ncontext-dependent item sets; the \"integrated testlet\". In an integrated testlet\ncertain items are purposefully inter-dependent and are thus presented in a\nparticular order. Such integrated testlets represent a proxy of typical CR\nquestions, but with a straightforward and uniform marking scheme that also\nallows for granting partial credit for proximal knowledge.

These model\nelements, whose dependence on relative azimuth angle has the form\n$\\cos[m(\\phi_1-\\phi_2)]$ where $m > 2$, were introduced to support a\nhydrodynamic flow interpretation of the same-side ($|\\phi_1-\\phi_2| < \\pi/2$)\n2D peak in the correlations. Previous studies have shown that the $m > 2$\nharmonics are not required by the data, that they destabilize the fitting\nmodels, and that their net effect is to decompose the same-side peak into two\ncomponents, one being dependent on and the other being independent of relative\npseudorapidity. Thus we are lead to question whether descriptions of angular\ncorrelation data including higher-order harmonics inform our understanding of\nthe same-side peak or heavy-ion collisions in general. Results from analysis of\ntwo-dimensional angular correlation data from the Relativistic Heavy-Ion\nCollider (RHIC) and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) show that the RHIC data do\nnot exclude a single-Gaussian hypothesis for the same-side peak. We find that\nthe net effect of including the $m = 3$ harmonic or azimuth sextupole in the\nfitting model is the inclusion of small non-Gaussian dependence in the\nmathematical description of the same-side peak. Those non-Gaussian effects are\nsystematically insignificant and can be accommodated by minor perturbations to\nthe same-side 2D Gaussian peak model, which act locally at small relative\nazimuth. We also demonstrate that the 0-1% 2D angular correlation data for 2.76\nTeV Pb+Pb collisions from ATLAS, which display an away-side double peak on\nazimuth, do not require a sextupole and exclude a positive same-side sextupole.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Aug 2013 18:10:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

Measurements of isotopic ratios\nin cometary materials provide strong constraints on the content of the\nprotosolar nebula. Their relation with the composition of the parental dark\nclouds is, however, still very elusive. In this paper, we bring new constraints\nbased on the isotopic composition of nitrogen in dark clouds, with the aim of\nunderstanding the chemical processes that are responsible for the observed\nisotopic ratios. We have observed and detected the fundamental rotational\ntransition of C$^{15}$N towards two starless dark clouds, L1544 and L1498. We\nwere able to derive the column density ratio of C$^{15}$N over $^{13}$CN\ntowards the same clouds, and obtain the CN/C$^{15}$N isotopic ratios, which\nwere found to be $500\\pm75$ for both L1544 and L1498. These values are\ntherefore marginally consistent with the protosolar value of 441. Moreover,\nthis ratio is larger than the isotopic ratio of nitrogen measured in HCN. In\naddition, we present model calculations of the chemical fractionation of\nnitrogen in dark clouds, which make it possible to understand how CN can be\ndeprived of $^{15}$N and HCN can simultaneously be enriched in heavy nitrogen.\nThe non-fractionation of N2H+, however, remains an open issue and we propose\nsome chemical way of alleviating the discrepancy between model predictions and\nthe observed ratios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Aug 2013 19:08:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-21"}

Recently, scaling properties were shown to fluctuate\nacross brain networks and to be modulated between rest and task (He, 2011):\nnotably, Hurst exponent, quantifying long memory, decreases under task in\nactivating and deactivating brain regions. In most cases, such results were\nobtained: First, from univariate (voxelwise or regionwise) analysis, hence\nfocusing on specific cognitive systems such as Resting-State Networks (RSNs)\nand raising the issue of the specificity of this scale-free dynamics modulation\nin RSNs. Second, using analysis tools designed to measure a single scaling\nexponent related to the second order statistics of the data, thus relying on\nmodels that either implicitly or explicitly assume Gaussianity and (asymptotic)\nself-similarity, while fMRI signals may significantly depart from those either\nof those two assumptions (Ciuciu et al., 2008; Wink et al., 2008). To address\nthese issues, the present contribution elaborates on the analysis of the\nscaling properties of fMRI temporal dynamics by proposing two significant\nvariations. First, scaling properties are technically investigated using the\nrecently introduced Wavelet Leader-based Multifractal formalism (WLMF; Wendt et\nal., 2007). This measures a collection of scaling exponents, thus enables a\nricher and more versatile description of scale invariance (beyond correlation\nand Gaussianity), referred to as multifractality. Also, it benefits from\nimproved estimation performance compared to tools previously used in the\nliterature. Second, scaling properties are investigated in both RSN and non-RSN\nstructures (e.g., artifacts), at a broader spatial scale than the voxel one,\nusing a multivariate approach, namely the Multi-Subject Dictionary Learning\n(MSDL) algorithm (Varoquaux et al., 2011) that produces a set of spatial\ncomponents that appear more sparse than their Independent Component Analysis\n(ICA) counterpart. These tools are combined and applied to a fMRI dataset\ncomprising 12 subjects with resting-state and activation runs (Sadaghiani et\nal., 2009). Results stemming from those analysis confirm the already reported\ntask-related decrease of long memory in functional networks, but also show that\nit occurs in artifacts, thus making this feature not specific to functional\nnetworks. Further, results indicate that most fMRI signals appear multifractal\nat rest except in non-cortical regions. Task-related modulation of\nmultifractality appears only significant in functional networks and thus can be\nconsidered as the key property disentangling functional networks from\nartifacts. These finding are discussed in the light of the recent literature\nreporting scaling dynamics of EEG microstate sequences at rest and addressing\nnon-stationarity issues in temporally independent fMRI modes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Aug 2013 19:21:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-21"}

According\nto these, strong enough punishment should prevent crime from happening. To gain\na better understanding of the relationship between crime and punishment, we\nconsider that the latter requires prior discovery of illicit behavior and study\na spatial version of the inspection game. Simulations reveal the spontaneous\nemergence of cyclic dominance between ''criminals'', ''inspectors'', and\n''ordinary people'' as a consequence of spatial interactions. Such cycles\ndominate the evolutionary process, in particular when the temptation to commit\ncrime or the cost of inspection are low or moderate.

In particular, circular prograde satellites remain\nstable out to $\\sim 0.4 R_H$ (where $R_H$ is the Hill Radius) as opposed to\n$\\sim 0.5 R_H$ in the single-planet case. A similarly small restriction in the\nstable parameter-space for retrograde satellites is observed, where planetary\nclose approaches in the range 2.5 to 4.5 mutual Hill radii destabilize most\nsatellites orbits only if $a\\sim 0.65 R_H$. In very close planetary pairs (e.g.\nthe 12:11 resonance) the addition of a satellite frequently destabilizes the\nentire system, causing extreme close-approaches and the loss of satellites over\na range of circumplanetary semi-major axes.

Radio data covering as many as\n10 individual bands allows for spectral indices to be measured over three\nfrequency bins between 0.15-32.5 GHz. Sources having the flattest spectral\nindices measured at ~2 and 4 GHz, arising from large free-free optical depths\namong the densest starbursts, appear to be in ongoing through post-stage\nmergers. The spectral indices measured at higher frequencies (i.e., ~12 GHz)\nare steepest for sources associated with ongoing mergers in which their nuclei\nare distinct, but either share a common stellar envelope and/or exhibit tidal\ntails. These results hold after excluding potential AGN based on their low\n6.2um PAH EQWs. Consequently, the low-, mid-, and high-frequency spectral\nindices each appear to be sensitive to the exact merger stage. It is\nadditionally shown that ongoing mergers, whose progenitors are still separated\nand share a common envelope and/or exhibit tidal tails, also exhibit excess\nradio emission relative to what is expected given the far-infrared/radio\ncorrelation, suggesting that there may be a significant amount of radio\nemission that is not associated with ongoing star formation.

These spectra had\nintensity peaks in the range of 30-60 MeV, decreasing at both lower energies\ndown to a few MeV and at higher energies up to several hundred MeV. We have\nmodeled the propagation of these particles in the galaxy using an updated Leaky\nBox Diffusion model which determines the spectra of these components from ~2\nMeV to >200 GeV. The key parameters used in the model are a galactic input\nspectrum ~P^-2.24, the same for all components and independent of rigidity, and\na diffusion coefficient that is ~P^0.5 above a lower rigidity and increases\n~beta^-1.0 below a lower rigidity ~0.56 GV. These same parameters also fit the\nhigh energy H and He data from ~10-200 GeV/nuc from the PAMELA and BESS\nexperiments. The new Voyager spectra for all three nuclei are thus consistent\nwith rigidity spectra ~P^-2.24 from the lowest energies to at least 100 GeV.\nDeviations from this spectrum can reasonably be attributed to propagation\neffects. Some deviations between the calculated and newly observed spectra are\nnoted, however, below ~30 MeV/nuc, particularly for C/O nuclei, that could be\nsignificant regarding the propagation and sources of these particles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Aug 2013 20:22:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-22"}

The double well is\nasymmetric, with the local ground state in the shallow well nearly degenerate\nwith the first excited state of the adjacent deep well. We compare the band\nstructure obtained from a tight-binding (TB) model with that obtained\nnumerically using a plane wave basis. We find the TB model to be in\nquantitative agreement for the lowest two bands, qualitative for next two\nbands, and inadequate for even higher bands. The band widths of the excited\nbands are much larger than the harmonic oscillator energy spacing in the $z$\ndirection. We then study the thermodynamics of a non-interacting Bose gas in\nthe first excited band. We estimate the condensate fraction and critical\ntemperature, $T_c$, as functions of lattice parameters. For typical atom\nnumbers, the critical energy $k_BT_c$, with $k_B$ the Boltzmann constant, is\nlarger than the excited band widths and harmonic oscillator energy. Using\nconservation of total energy and atom number, we show that the temperature\nincreases after the lattice transformation.

We relate the\ndegree of temporal smearing and the profile of a scattered source to the\nevolution of turbulent structure in the IGM as a function of redshift. We\nestimate the degree of scattering expected by analysing the contributions to\nthe Scattering Measure (SM) of the various components of baryonic matter\nembedded in the IGM, including the diffuse IGM, intervening galaxies and\nintracluster gas. These estimates predict that the amount of temporal smearing\nexpected at 300\\,MHz is typically as low as ~1 ms and suggests that these\nbursts may be detectable with low frequency widefield arrays. A generalization\nof the DM-SM relation observed for Galactic scattering to the densities and\nturbulent conditions relevant to the IGM suggests that scattering measures of\norder 10^{-6} kpc m {-20/3} would be expected at z ~ 1.

The redshift dependence of the temporal smearing\ndiscriminates between scattering that occurs in the host galaxy of the burst\nand the IGM, with tau_host \\propto (1+z)^{-3} if the scattering probes length\nscales below the inner scale of the turbulence or tau_host \\propto\n(1+z)^{-17/5} if the turbulence follows a Kolmogorov spectrum. This differs\nstrongly from the expected IGM scaling tau_{IGM} ~ z^2 for z < 1 and\n(1+z)^{0.2-0.5} for z >> 1.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Aug 2013 01:15:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

In particular, we focus on data structures which allow such\ntraversals to be performed efficiently in the external memory setting. In\naddition, for trees and planar graphs the data structures we present are\nsuccinct. Our tree structures permit efficient bottom-up path traversal in\nrooted trees of arbitrary degree and efficient top-down path traversal in\nbinary trees. In the graph setting, we permit efficient traversal of an\narbitrary path in bounded degree planar graphs. Our data structures for both\ntrees and graphs match or slightly improve current best results for external\nmemory path traversal in these settings while at the same time improving space\nbounds due to the succinct nature of our data structures. Employing our path\ntraversal structure for bounded degree planar graphs, we describe a number of\nuseful applications of this technique for triangular meshes in R^2. As an\nextension of the R^2 representation for triangular meshes we also present an\nefficient external memory representation for well-shaped tetrahedral meshes in\nR^3.

We work in the interesting\ncase that the conductances are positive, but may assume arbitrarily small\nvalues. Thus, the underlying picture of the principle is a joint strategy of\nsmall conductance values and large holding times of the walk. The speed and the\nrate function of our principle are explicit in terms of the lower tails of the\nconductance distribution as well as the time-dependent size of the box.\n  An interesting phase transition occurs if the thickness parameter of the\nconductance tails exceeds a certain threshold: for thicker tails, the random\nwalk spreads out over the entire growing box, for thinner tails it stays\nconfined to some bounded region. In fact, in the first case, the rate function\nturns out to be equal to the $p$-th power of the $p$-norm of the gradient of\nthe square root for some $p\\in(\\frac {2d}{d+2},2)$. This extends the\nDonsker-Varadhan-G\\\"artner rate function for the local times of Brownian motion\n(with deterministic environment) from $p=2$ to these values.\n  As corollaries of our LDP, we derive the logarithmic asymptotics of the\nnon-exit probability of the RWRC from the growing box, and the Lifshitz tails\nof the generator of the RWRC, the randomised Laplace operator.\n  To contrast with the annealed, not uniformly elliptic case, we also provide\nan LDP in the quenched setting for conductances that are bounded and bounded\naway from zero.

Sahel and Eastern Australia are remarkably dry regions, where low\namounts of rainfall are uniformly distributed on continental scales and\nsmall-scale extreme events are rare. As a consequence, the precipitation\ngradient is low, making these regions well connected on a large spatial scale.\nOn the contrary, the Asiatic South-East is often reached by extreme events such\nas monsoons, tropical cyclones and heat waves, which can all contribute to\nreduce the correlation to the short-range scale only.\n  Some patterns emerging between mid-latitude and tropical regions suggest a\npossible impact of the propagation of planetary waves on precipitation at a\nglobal scale. Other links can be qualitatively associated to the atmospheric\nand oceanic circulation.

Non-thermal emission up to TeV energies is observed near\nperiastron passage, attributed to emission from high energy e+e- pairs\naccelerated at the shock with the circumstellar material from the companion\nstar, resulting in a small-scale pulsar wind nebula. Weak gamma-ray emission\nwas detected by the Fermi/LAT at the last periastron passage, unexpectedly\nfollowed 30 days later by a strong flare, limited to the GeV band, during which\nthe luminosity nearly reached the spindown power of the pulsar. The origin of\nthis GeV flare remains mysterious. We investigate whether the flare could have\nbeen caused by pairs, located in the vicinity of the pulsar, up-scattering\nX-ray photons from the surrounding pulsar wind nebula rather than UV stellar\nphotons, as usually assumed. Such a model is suggested by the geometry of the\ninteraction region at the time of the flare.

The GeV lightcurve\npeaks well after periastron with this geometry. The pairs are inferred to have\na Lorentz factor ~500.

However, this photon-assisted\nfeature is suppressed in the case of a $y$-polarized photon field due to the\nanisotropy of our system caused by its geometry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Aug 2013 11:03:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-15"}

A lepton collider\nwill allow for exploration of Standard Model Physics, such as precise\nmeasurements of the Higgs, top and gauge sectors, in addition to enabling a\nmultitude of New Physics searches. However, physics analyses at such a collider\nwill place unprecedented demands on calorimetry, with a required jet energy\nresolution of \\sigma(E)/E < 3.5%. To meet these requirements will need a new\napproach to calorimetry.\n  The particle flow approach to calorimetry requires both fine granularity\ndetectors and sophisticated software algorithms. It promises to deliver\nunparalleled jet energy resolution by fully reconstructing the paths of\nindividual particles through the detector. The energies of charged particles\ncan then be extracted from precise inner detector tracker measurements, whilst\nphoton energies will be measured in the ECAL, and only neutral hadron energies\n(10% of jet energies) will be measured in the HCAL, largely avoiding the\ntypically poor HCAL resolution.\n  This document introduces the Pandora particle flow algorithms, which offer\nthe current state of the art in particle flow calorimetry for the ILC and CLIC.\nThe performance of the algorithms is investigated by examining the\nreconstructed jet energy resolution and the ability to separate the hadronic\ndecays of W and Z bosons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Aug 2013 11:04:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-22"}

The observations were carried out in\n2011 using the Chandra High Energy Transmission Grating and the XMM-Newton\nReflection Grating Spectrometer, with net exposure times of approximately 400\nks each. A multitude of absorption lines from C to Fe are detected, revealing\nat least 3 warm absorbing components ranging in ionization parameter from\nlog(\\xi/erg cm s^-1) = 1-3 and with outflow velocities < 500 km/s. The lowest\nionization absorber appears to vary between the Chandra and XMM-Newton\nobservations, which implies a radial distance of between 9-17 pc from the black\nhole. Several broad soft X-ray emission lines are strongly detected, most\nnotably from He-like Oxygen, with FWHM velocity widths of up to 10000 km/s,\nconsistent with an origin from Broad Line Region (BLR) clouds. In addition to\nthe warm absorber, gas partially covering the line of sight to the quasar\nappears to be present, of typical column density N_H = 10^23 cm^-2.

It is assumed that transmission power and covariance of the input\nsignal vectors are varied depending on the sensed activities of primary users\n(PUs) in the system. Interference constraints are applied on the transmission\npower levels of cognitive radios (CRs) to provide protection for the PUs whose\nactivities are modeled as a Markov chain. Considering the reliability of the\ntransmissions and channel sensing results, a state-transition model is\nprovided. Throughput is determined by formulating the effective capacity. First\nderivative of the effective capacity is derived in the low-power regime and the\nminimum bit energy requirements in the presence of QoS limitations and\nimperfect sensing results are identified. Minimum energy per bit is shown to be\nachieved by beamforming in the maximal-eigenvalue eigenspace of certain\nmatrices related to the channel matrix. In a special case, wideband slope is\ndetermined for more refined analysis of energy efficiency. Numerical results\nare provided for the throughput for various levels of buffer constraints and\ndifferent number of transmit and receive antennas.

It\nis shown that increasing the number of antennas when the interference power\nconstraint is stringent is generally beneficial.

At each moment of time, an instance characterized by a\ncertain context may arrive to each learner; based on the context, the learner\ncan select one of its own actions (which gives a reward and provides\ninformation) or request assistance from another learner. In the latter case,\nthe requester pays a cost and receives the reward but the provider learns the\ninformation. In our framework, learners are modeled as cooperative contextual\nbandits. Each learner seeks to maximize the expected reward from its arrivals,\nwhich involves trading off the reward received from its own actions, the\ninformation learned from its own actions, the reward received from the actions\nrequested of others and the cost paid for these actions - taking into account\nwhat it has learned about the value of assistance from each other learner. We\ndevelop distributed online learning algorithms and provide analytic bounds to\ncompare the efficiency of these with algorithms with the complete knowledge\n(oracle) benchmark (in which the expected reward of every action in every\ncontext is known by every learner). Our estimates show that regret - the loss\nincurred by the algorithm - is sublinear in time.

Each site of the square\nlattice has 4 nearest-neighbour exchange bonds of strength $J_{1}$ and 2\nnext-nearest-neighbour (diagonal) bonds of strength $J_{2}$. The $J_{2}$ bonds\nare arranged so that the basic square plaquettes in alternating columns have\neither both or no $J_{2}$ bonds included.

The variability in\nobserved ions is conventionally explained either by variations in the driving\nmechanisms or the changes in the ionizing flux or due to density effects,\nwhilst thermodynamic stability considerations have been largely ignored. It\nwould appear that the observability of particular ions in different BHB states\ncan be accounted for through simple thermodynamic considerations in the static\nlimit. Our calculations predict that in the disk dominated soft thermal and\nintermediate states, the wind should be thermodynamically stable and hence\nobservable. On the other hand, in the powerlaw dominated spectrally hard state\nthe wind is found to be thermodynamically unstable for a certain range of 3.55\n<= log \\xi <= 4.20. In the spectrally hard state, a large number of the He-like\nand H-like ions (including e.g. Fe XXV, Ar XVIII and S XV) have peak ion\nfractions in the unstable ionization parameter (\\xi) range, making these ions\nundetectable.

Using the linear instability analysis in\nthe kinetic limit, which properly accounts for the longitudinal and the small\nbut finite perpendicular momentum spread in the pair momentum distribution\nfunction, the growth rate of parallel propagating electrostatic oscillations in\nthe intergalactic medium is calculated. Contrary to the claims of Miniati and\nElyiv (2013) we find that neither the longitudinal nor the perpendicular spread\nin the relativistic pair distribution function do significantly affect the\nelectrostatic growth rates. The maximum kinetic growth rate for no\nperpendicular spread is even about an order of magnitude greater than the\ncorresponding reactive maximum growth rate. The reduction factors to the\nmaximum growth rate due to the finite perpendicular spread in the pair\ndistribution function are tiny, and always less than $10^{-4}$. We confirm the\nearlier conclusions by Broderick et al. (2012) and us, that the created pair\nbeam distribution function is quickly unstable in the unmagnetized\nintergalactic medium. Therefore, there is no need to require the existence of\nsmall intergalactic magnetic fields to scatter the produced pairs, so that the\nexplanation (made by several authors) of the FERMI non-detection of the inverse\nCompton scattered GeV gamma rays by a finite deflecting intergalactic magnetic\nfield is not necessary. In particular, the various derived lower bounds for the\nintergalactic magnetic fields are invalid due to the pair beam instability\nargument.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Aug 2013 14:24:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

In\ncontrast to the traditional adiabatic connection formulation, both ensemble\nweights and interaction strength can vary along a GACE path while the ensemble\ndensity is held fixed. The theory is presented for non-degenerate two-state\nensembles but it can in principle be extended to any ensemble of fractionally\noccupied excited states. Within such a formalism an exact expression for the\nensemble exchange-correlation density-functional energy, in terms of the\nconventional ground-state exchange-correlation energy, is obtained by\nintegration over the ensemble weight. Stringent constraints on the functional\nare thus obtained when expanding the ensemble exchange-correlation energy\nthrough second order in the ensemble weight. For illustration purposes, the\nanalytical derivation of the GACE is presented for the H2 model system in a\nminimal basis, leading thus to a simple density-functional approximation to the\nensemble exchange-correlation energy. Encouraging results were obtained with\nthis approximation for the description in a large basis of the first\n^1\\Sigma^+_g excitation in H2 upon bond stretching.

The\nmajority of these observed X-ray flares are easily distinguishable by eye and\nhave been measured to have up to as much fluence as the original prompt\nemission.

Most biological databases contain significant\nquantities of textual annotation, which often contains the richest source of\nknowledge. Many databases reuse existing knowledge, during the curation process\nannotations are often propagated between entries. However, this is often not\nmade explicit. Therefore, it can be hard, potentially impossible, for a reader\nto identify where an annotation originated from. Within this work we attempt to\nidentify annotation provenance and track its subsequent propagation.\nSpecifically, we exploit annotation reuse within the UniProt Knowledgebase\n(UniProtKB), at the level of individual sentences. We describe a visualisation\napproach for the provenance and propagation of sentences in UniProtKB which\nenables a large-scale statistical analysis. Initially levels of sentence reuse\nwithin UniProtKB were analysed, showing that reuse is heavily prevalent, which\nenables the tracking of provenance and propagation. By analysing sentences\nthroughout UniProtKB, a number of interesting propagation patterns were\nidentified, covering over 100, 000 sentences. Over 8000 sentences remain in the\ndatabase after they have been removed from the entries where they originally\noccurred. Analysing a subset of these sentences suggest that approximately 30%\nare erroneous, whilst 35% appear to be inconsistent. These results suggest that\nbeing able to visualise sentence propagation and provenance can aid in the\ndetermination of the accuracy and quality of textual annotation.

The battery has a tendency to maintain electric potential\ndifference across its terminals equal to its chemical potential, and in an open\ncircuit, when no current flows, these two do match. However in a closed\ncircuit, a drop in electric potential across the battery terminals is\ninevitable for a steady flow of electric current throughout the circuit,\nbecause the chemical reactions driving the electric current within the battery\ncan proceed only if the electric potential at its terminals differs from the\nchemical potential. It is shown that for small voltage changes, the current\npassing through the battery is linearly proportional to the change in potential\nfrom the open-circuit value (i.e., its chemical potential), giving rise to a\nsemblance of an internal resistance in series with the external resistance. It\nfollows that a battery {\\em has to have} an internal resistance in order to\nfunction as a power source.

The fact that one measures different probabilities in both\nexperiments is traced back to the superposition of two orthogonal but\nnonentangled substates in the quantum mechanical case. This superposition\nresults in an interference term that can be splitted into two additional states\nrepresenting a sink and a source of probabilities in the classical event space\nrelated to Bells experiment. As a consequence, a statistical operator can be\nrelated to the quantum mechanical Bells experiment that contains already\nnegative quasi probabilities, as usually known from quantum optics in\nconjunction with the Glauber-Sudarshan equation. It is proven that the\nexistence of such negative quasi probabilities are neither a sufficient nor a\nnecessary condition for entanglement. The equivalence of using an interaction\npicture in a fixed basis or of employing a change of basis to describe Bells\nexperiment is demonstrated afterwards.
