We discuss the impact of a change in the metallicity by comparing the\ncurrent tracks with models computed with exactly the same physical ingredients\nbut with a metallicity Z = 0.014 (solar). We show that the width of the\nmain-sequence (MS) band in the upper part of the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram\n(HRD), for luminosity above log(L/Lsun) > 5.5, is very sensitive to rotational\nmixing. Strong mixing significantly reduces the MS width. We confirm, but here\nfor the first time on the whole mass range, that surface enrichments are\nstronger at low metallicity provided that comparisons are made for equivalent\ninitial mass, rotation and evolutionary stage. We show that the enhancement\nfactor due to a lowering of the metallicity (all other factors kept constant)\nincreases when the initial mass decreases. Present models predict an upper\nluminosity for the red supergiants (RSG) of log (L/Lsun) around 5.5 at Z =\n0.002 in agreement with the observed upper limit of RSG in the Small Magellanic\nCloud. We show that models using shear diffusion coefficient calibrated to\nreproduce the surface enrichments observed for MS B-type stars at Z = 0.014 can\nalso reproduce the stronger enrichments observed at low metallicity.

We first analyze the capacity region for this problem under both\nideal (arbitrarily high velocity, long scheduling periods) and realistic\nconditions. We indicate how robots could be scheduled optimally to satisfy any\narrival rate in the capacity region, given prior knowledge about arrival rates.\nWe find that if the number of robots allocated grows proportionally with the\nnumber of source-sink pairs, then the capacity of the network scales as\n$\\Theta(1)$, similar to what was shown previously by Grossglauser and Tse for\nuncontrolled mobility; however, in contrast to that prior result, we also find\nthat with controlled mobility this constant capacity scaling can be obtained\nwhile ensuring finite delay. We then consider the setting where the arrival\nrates are unknown and present a coarse-grained backpressure message ferrying\nalgorithm (CBMF) for it. In CBMF, the robots are matched to sources and sinks\nonce every epoch to maximize a queue-differential-based weight. The matching\ncontrols both motion and transmission for each robot: if a robot is matched to\na source, it moves towards that source and collects data from it; and if it is\nmatched to a sink, it moves towards that sink and transmits data to it. We show\nthrough analysis and simulations the conditions under which CBMF can stabilize\nthe network. We show that the maximum achievable stable throughput with this\npolicy tends to the ideal capacity as the schedule duration and robot velocity\nincrease.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Aug 2013 17:32:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-14"}

This epistemological\nviewpoint is based on the philosophical theses advanced by Ludwig Boltzmann\n(1844-1906) which states that scientific theories are nothing more than\nrepresentations, or images, of nature (arXiv:physics/0701308v1). By being\nrepresentations one cannot know how nature really is because the intrinsic and\nindispensable properties that characterize nature are unreachable by science.\nIn other words, the true essences that constitute nature are unknowable.\nTherefore, all answers proposed by science are partial, simplified and\nreplaceable. Another way of putting forward this viewpoint is to state that all\nscientific truths are provisional, a result which naturally leads to the\nconclusion that the same set of phenomena, or scientific questions, may have\nvarious answers, or representations. This conclusion is generally known as\ntheoretical pluralism (arXiv:physics/9806011). It is exactly such a plurality\nfor conceiving, or representing, nature that opens the way for a possibly\nfruitful dialog among the various forms of thinking, since this dialog can take\nplace in the realm of the representations.

In order for a path integral to be at least formally\nequivalent to the corresponding canonical quantization, at each point in the\nspace of histories it is important that the integrand have not only the correct\nphase -- a topic of recent focus in spin-foams -- but also the correct modulus,\nusually referred to as the measure factor. The correct measure factor descends\nfrom the Liouville measure on the reduced phase space, and its calculation is a\ntask of canonical analysis.\n  The covariant formulation of gravity from which spin-foams are derived is the\nPlebanski-Holst formulation, in which the basic variables are a Lorentz\nconnection and a Lorentz-algebra valued two-form, called the Plebanski\ntwo-form. However, in the final spin-foam sum, one sums over only spins and\nintertwiners, which label eigenstates of the Plebanski two-form alone. The\nspin-foam sum is therefore a discretized version of a Plebanski-Holst path\nintegral in which only the Plebanski two-form appears, and in which the\nconnection degrees of freedom have been integrated out. We call this a purely\ngeometric Plebanski-Holst path integral.\n  In prior work in which one of the authors was involved, the measure factor\nfor the Plebanski-Holst path integral with both connection and two-form\nvariables was calculated. Before one discretizes this measure and incorporates\nit into a spin-foam sum, however, one must integrate out the connection in\norder to obtain the purely geometric version of the path integral. To calculate\nthis purely geometric path integral is the principal task of the present paper,\nand it is done in two independent ways. Gauge-fixing and the background\nindependence of the resulting path integral are discussed in the appendices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Aug 2013 19:12:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

In this paper, we study binary-single\nstellar scatterings occurring in dense stellar systems as a source of\neccentrically-inspiraling binaries. Many interactions between compact binaries\nand single objects are characterized by chaotic resonances in which the\nbinary-single system undergoes many exchanges before reaching a final state.\nDuring these chaotic resonances, a pair of objects has a non-negligible\nprobability of experiencing a very close passage. Significant orbital energy\nand angular momentum are carried away from the system by gravitational wave\n(GW) radiation in these close passages and in some cases this implies an\ninspiral time shorter than the orbital period of the bound third body. We\nderive the cross section for such dynamical inspiral outcomes through\nanalytical arguments and through numerical scattering experiments including GW\nlosses. We show that the cross section for dynamical inspirals grows with\nincreasing target binary semi-major axis, $a$, and that for equal-mass binaries\nit scales as $a^{2/7}$. Thus, we expect wide target binaries to predominantly\ncontribute to the production of these relativistic outcomes. We estimate that\neccentric inspirals account for approximately one percent of dynamically\nassembled non-eccentric merging binaries.

A certain class of disks, called transition disks,\nexhibit cavities in dust images at scales of up to a few 10s of AU. The\nformation mechanism of the cavities is still unclear. The gas content of such\ncavities can be spatially resolved for the first time using the Atacama Large\nMillimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA).\n  We have developed a new series of models to simulate the physical conditions\nand chemical abundances of the gas in cavities to address the question whether\nthe gas is primarily atomic or molecular inside the dust free cavities exposed\nto intense UV radiation. Molecular/atomic line emission by carbon monoxide\n(CO), its isotopologues (13CO, C18O, C17O, and 13C18O) and related species\n([CI], [CII], and [OI]) is predicted for comparison with ALMA and the Herschel\nSpace Observatory.\n  The gas can remain in molecular form down to very low amounts of gas in the\ncavity. Shielding of the stellar radiation by a dusty inner disk\n(pre-transition disk) allows CO to survive down to lower gas masses in the\ncavity. The main parameter for the CO emission from cavity is the gas mass.\nOther parameters such as the outer disk mass, bolometric luminosity, shape of\nthe stellar spectrum or PAH abundance are less important. Since the CO pure\nrotational lines readily become optically thick, the CO isotopologues need to\nbe observed in order to quantitatively determine the amount of gas in the\ncavity.\n  A wide range of gas masses in the cavity of transition disks (~4 orders of\nmagnitude) can be probed using combined observations of CO isotopologue lines\nwith ALMA.

For massive galaxies, M*>~10^10.6 Msol, our results indicate\nthat star-forming galaxies grow proportionately as fast as their dark matter\nhalos while quiescent galaxies are outpaced by dark matter growth.

Passive replication differs from\nactive replication in that it requires processes to cross a barrier before they\nbecome primaries and start broadcasting messages. In this paper, we propose a\nbarrier function tau that explains and encapsulates the differences between\nexisting primary-order atomic broadcast algorithms, namely semi-passive\nreplication and Zookeeper atomic broadcast (Zab), as well as the differences\nbetween Paxos and Zab. We also show that implementing primary-order atomic\nbroadcast on top of a generic consensus primitive and tau inherently results in\nhigher time complexity than atomic broadcast, as witnessed by existing\nalgorithms. We overcome this problem by presenting an alternative,\nprimary-order atomic broadcast implementation that builds on top of a generic\nconsensus primitive and uses consensus itself to form a barrier.

The detection of a\n'kilonova'-like signature associated to the Swift-detected GRB 130603B has\nsuggested that this event is the result of a compact object merger. Our\nknowledge on SGRB has been, until now, mostly based on the absence of supernova\nsignatures and the analysis of the host galaxies to which they cannot always be\nsecurely associated. Further progress has been significantly hampered by the\nfaintness and rapid fading of their optical counterparts (afterglows), which\nhas so far precluded spectroscopy of such events. Afterglow spectroscopy is the\nkey tool to firmly determine the distance at which the burst was produced,\ncrucial to understand its physics, and study its local environment. Here we\npresent the first spectra of a prototypical SGRB afterglow in which both\nabsorption and emission features are clearly detected. Together with\nmultiwavelength photometry we study the host and environment of GRB 130603B.\nFrom these spectra we determine the redshift of the burst to be z =\n0.3565+/-0.0002, measure rich dynamics both in absorption and emission, and a\nsubstantial line of sight extinction of A_V = 0.86+/-0.15 mag. The GRB was\nlocated at the edge of a disrupted arm of a moderately star forming galaxy with\nnear-solar metallicity. Unlike for most long GRBs (LGRBs), N_HX / A_V is\nconsistent with the Galactic ratio, indicating that the explosion site differs\nfrom those found in LGRBs. The merger is not associated with the most\nstar-forming region of the galaxy; however, it did occur in a dense region,\nimplying a rapid merger or a low natal kick velocity for the compact object\nbinary.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Aug 2013 21:42:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 Dec 2013 13:08:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-17"}

The mean differences are SFR_GAMA/SFR_IFU =\n1.26+/-0.23, sigma=0.90 and for the Sloan Digital Sky Survey we similarly find\nSFR_Brinchmann/SFR_IFU = 1.34+/-0.17, sigma=0.67.

Under pressure PaN is found to undergo a structural transition\nfrom NaCl to the R-3m structure near 58 GPa. The high pressure behavior of the\nacoustic phonon branch along the (1,0,0) and (1,1,0) directions, and the C44\nelastic constant are anomalous, which signals the structural transition. With\nGGA exchange-correlation, a topological transition in the charge density occurs\nnear the structural transition which may be regarded as a quantum phase\ntransition, where the order parameter obeys a mean field scaling law. However,\nthe topological transition is absent when other exchange-correlation\nfunctionals are invoked (local density approximation (LDA) and hybrid\nfunctional). Therefore, this constitutes an example of GGA and LDA leading to\nqualitatively different predictions, and it is of great interest to examine\nexperimentally whether this topological transition occurs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Aug 2013 07:09:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-15"}

A good image quality assessment (IQA) model should\nnot only deliver high quality prediction accuracy but also be computationally\nefficient. The efficiency of IQA metrics is becoming particularly important due\nto the increasing proliferation of high-volume visual data in high-speed\nnetworks. We present a new effective and efficient IQA model, called gradient\nmagnitude similarity deviation (GMSD). The image gradients are sensitive to\nimage distortions, while different local structures in a distorted image suffer\ndifferent degrees of degradations. This motivates us to explore the use of\nglobal variation of gradient based local quality map for overall image quality\nprediction. We find that the pixel-wise gradient magnitude similarity (GMS)\nbetween the reference and distorted images combined with a novel pooling\nstrategy the standard deviation of the GMS map can predict accurately\nperceptual image quality. The resulting GMSD algorithm is much faster than most\nstate-of-the-art IQA methods, and delivers highly competitive prediction\naccuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Aug 2013 07:25:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 Nov 2013 03:55:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-27"}

Phase retrieval attempts the recovery of the phase information of a\nsignal from the magnitude of its Fourier transform to enable the reconstruction\nof the original signal. A fundamental question then is: \"Under which conditions\ncan we uniquely recover the signal of interest from its measured magnitudes?\"\nIn this paper, we assume the measured signal to be sparse. This is a natural\nassumption in many applications, such as X-ray crystallography, speckle imaging\nand blind channel estimation. In this work, we derive a sufficient condition\nfor the uniqueness of the solution of the phase retrieval (PR) problem for both\ndiscrete and continuous domains, and for one and multi-dimensional domains.\nMore precisely, we show that there is a strong connection between PR and the\nturnpike problem, a classic combinatorial problem. We also prove that the\nexistence of collisions in the autocorrelation function of the signal may\npreclude the uniqueness of the solution of PR. Then, assuming the absence of\ncollisions, we prove that the solution is almost surely unique on 1-dimensional\ndomains. Finally, we extend this result to multi-dimensional signals by solving\na set of 1-dimensional problems. We show that the solution of the\nmulti-dimensional problem is unique when the autocorrelation function has no\ncollisions, significantly improving upon a previously known result.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Aug 2013 08:26:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 Sep 2013 09:26:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-27"}

METHODS.\nPublished inclination angles, derived from the stellar photospheric rotation or\nfrom spatially resolved circumstellar disk observations, are compared with\nvarious observed spectral properties, and correlations are established and\ninvestigated. RESULTS. Inclinations derived from the stellar rotation are found\nto be much less accurate than the published disk inclinations, and no\nsignificant correlations between spectral properties and inclinations based on\nrotation data could be detected. In contrast, significant correlations are\nfound between the disk inclination angles and the apparent velocities observed\nfor the forbidden emission lines and the wind absorption features of permitted\nlines.

Considering a sequence of\n$n$ pulses and pure dephasing due to quadratic coupling to Gaussian distributed\nnoise $\\xi(t)$, I use the linked-cluster (cumulant) expansion to calculate the\ncoherence decay. Solutions allowing for reconstruction of spectral density of\nnoise are given. For noise with correlation time shorter than the timescale on\nwhich coherence decays, the noise filtered by the dynamical decoupling\nprocedure can be treated as effectively Gaussian at large $n$, and\nwell-established methods of noise spectroscopy can be used to reconstruct the\nspectrum of $\\xi^{2}(t)$ noise. On the other hand, for noise of dominant\nlow-frequency character ($1/f^{\\beta}$ noise with $\\beta \\! > \\! 1$), an\ninfinite-order resummation of the cumulant expansion is necessary, and it leads\nto an analytical formula for coherence decay having a power-law tail at long\ntimes. In this case, the coherence at time $t$ depends both on spectral density\nof $\\xi(t)$ noise at $\\omega \\! = \\! n\\pi/t$, and on the effective\nlow-frequency cutoff of the noise spectrum, which is typically given by the\ninverse of the data acquisition time.

This coexistence mechanism,\nknown as relative nonlinearity of competition, is well understood\ntheoretically, but less is known about its evolutionary properties and its\nprevalence in real communities. We address this challenge by using adaptive\ndynamics theory and individual-based simulations to compare community\nstabilization and evolutionary stability of species that coexist by relative\nnonlinearity. In our analysis, evolution operates on the species'\ndensity-compensation strategies, and we consider a trade-off between population\ngrowth rates at high and low resource availability. We confirm previous\nfindings that, irrespective of the particular model of density dependence,\nthere are many combinations of overcompensating and undercompensating\ndensity-compensation strategies that allow stable coexistence by relative\nnonlinearity. However, our analysis also shows that most of these strategy\ncombinations are not evolutionarily stable and will be outcompeted by an\nintermediate density-compensation strategy. Only very specific trade-offs lead\nto evolutionarily stable coexistence by relative nonlinearity. As we find no\nreason why these particular trade-offs should be common in nature, we conclude\nthat the sympatric evolution and evolutionary stability of relative\nnonlinearity, while possible in principle, seems rather unlikely. We speculate\nthat this may, at least in part, explain why empirical demonstrations of this\ncoexistence mechanism are rare, noting, however, that the difficulty to detect\nrelative nonlinearity in the field [...]\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Aug 2013 13:23:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 21 Apr 2014 18:20:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 3 Aug 2014 12:30:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

All observations were carried out in 20 continuous, medium band\n(30 nm width) optical and 3 near-infrared (JHK) bands, providing the precise\nmeasurements of photometric redshifts. In addition, morphological\nclassification of galaxies is crucial for any kind of galaxy formation and\ncosmic evolution studies, providing the information about star formation\nhistories, their environment and interactions, internal perturbations, etc. We\npresent a morphological classification of > 40,000 galaxies in the ALHAMBRA\nsurvey.

Dust grains with radii\nlarger than 6nm are spheroids. Spheroidal dust particles have a factor 1.5 - 3\nlarger absorption cross section in the far IR than spherical grains of the same\nvolume. Mass estimates derived from submillimeter observations that ignore this\neffect are overestimated by the same amount.

The\nbispectrum measures two key nonlinear properties of a time series -- its\nreversability in time, and the symmetry about the mean of its flux distribution\n-- for triplets of frequencies. Like other Fourier methods, it is especially\nvaluable for working with time series which contain large numbers of cycles at\nthe period of interest, but in which the signal-to-noise at a given frequency\nis small in any individual cycle, either because of measurement errors, or\nbecause of the contributions from signals at other frequencies.

This allocation can be computed by\nuniformly raising the bandwidths of all users without violating capacity\nconstraints. We consider an extension of these allocations by raising the\nbandwidth with arbitrary and not necessarily uniform time-depending velocities\n(allocation rates). These allocations are used in a game-theoretic context for\nrouting choices, which we formalize in progressive filling games (PFGs).\n  We present a variety of results for equilibria in PFGs. We show that these\ngames possess pure Nash and strong equilibria. While computation in general is\nNP-hard, there are polynomial-time algorithms for prominent classes of\nMax-Min-Fair Games (MMFG), including the case when all users have the same\nsource-destination pair. We characterize prices of anarchy and stability for\npure Nash and strong equilibria in PFGs and MMFGs when players have different\nor the same source-destination pairs. In addition, we show that when a designer\ncan adjust allocation rates, it is possible to design games with optimal strong\nequilibria.

Using density functional theory calculations\nwe demonstrate that interface states play a decisive role in controlling the\ntransport spin polarization in this tunnel junction. For a realistic CoFe2O4\nbarrier thickness, we predict a tunneling spin polarization of about -60%.
