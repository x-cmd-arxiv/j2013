However, lasso\n$L_1$-regularized estimation remains the standard tool for industrial `Big\nData' applications because of its minimal computational cost and the presence\nof easy-to-apply rules for penalty selection. In response, this article\nproposes a simple new algorithm framework that requires no more computation\nthan a lasso path: the path of one-step estimators (POSE) does $L_1$ penalized\nregression estimation on a grid of decreasing penalties, but adapts\ncoefficient-specific weights to decrease as a function of the coefficient\nestimated in the previous path step. This provides sparse diminishing-bias\nregularization at no extra cost over the fastest lasso algorithms. Moreover,\nour `gamma lasso' implementation of POSE is accompanied by a reliable heuristic\nfor the fit degrees of freedom, so that standard information criteria can be\napplied in penalty selection. We also provide novel results on the distance\nbetween weighted-$L_1$ and $L_0$ penalized predictors; this allows us to build\nintuition about POSE and other diminishing-bias regularization schemes. The\nmethods and results are illustrated in extensive simulations and in application\nof logistic regression to evaluating the performance of hockey players.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Aug 2013 16:11:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 2 Sep 2013 18:36:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 6 Oct 2013 19:06:48 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 26 Nov 2013 22:11:25 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sat, 20 Sep 2014 05:25:15 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Sun, 8 Feb 2015 22:36:26 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Mon, 19 Oct 2015 15:24:18 GMT"},{"version":"v8","created":"Sun, 1 May 2016 20:35:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-03"}

The gathered information are then correlated using a\nmultiple regressors estimate where the error is assumed to be normally\ndistributed. This procedure yields a banded diagonal matrix which is then used\nas a preconditioner in the next iterative solve. This is repeated between\niterative solves until a good preconditioner is constructed on fly. This\nstatistically iterative procedure is progressive since the fidelity of the\npreconditioning matrix improves by adding more data obtained from matrix-vector\nproduct during the entire solution procedure.

The frequency contents of triggered and ambient\ntremor are largely identical, suggesting that tremor does not depend directly\non the nature of the source. We show here that the model of plate dynamics\ndeveloped earlier by us is an appropriate tool for describing the onset of\ntremor. In the framework of this model, tremor is an internal response of a\nfault to a failure triggered by external disturbances. The model predicts\ngeneration of radiation in a frequency range defined by the fault parameters.\nOther specific features predicted are: the upper limit of the size of the\nemitting area is a few dozen km; tremor accompanies earthquakes and aseismic\nslip; the frequency content of tremor depends on the type of failure. The model\nalso explains why a tremor has no clear impulsive phase, in contrast to\nearthquakes. A comparatively small effective normal stress (hence a high fluid\npressure) is required to make the model consistent with observed tremor\nparameters. Our model indicates that tremor is not necessarily a superposition\nof low frequency earthquakes, as commonly assumed, although the latter may\ntrigger them. The approach developed complements the conventional viewpoint\nwhich assumes that tremor reflects a frictional process with low rupture speed.\nEssentially our model adds the hypothesis that resonant-type oscillations exist\ninside a fault. This addition may change our understanding of the nature of\ntremor in general, and the methods of its identification and location in\nparticular.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Aug 2013 17:25:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-08"}

We consider a variant of the wonderful compactification of\nconfiguration spaces that works simultaneously for all graphs with a given\nnumber of vertices and that also accounts for the external structure of Feynman\ngraph. As in our previous work, we consider two version of the Feynman\namplitude in configuration space, which we refer to as the real and complex\nversions. In the real version, we show that we can extend to the massive case a\nmethod of evaluating Feynman integrals, based on expansion in Gegenbauer\npolynomials, that we investigated previously in the massless case. In the\ncomplex setting, we show that we can use algebro-geometric methods to\nrenormalize the Feynman amplitudes, so that the renormalized values of the\nFeynman integrals are given by periods of a mixed Tate motive. The\nregularization and renormalization procedure is based on pulling back the form\nto the wonderful compactification and replace it with a cohomologous one with\nlogarithmic poles. A complex of forms with logarithmic poles, endowed with an\noperator of pole subtraction, determines a Rota Baxter algebra on the wonderful\ncompactifications. We can then apply the renormalization procedure via Birkhoff\nfactorization, after interpreting the regularization as an algebra homomorphism\nfrom the Connes-Kreimer Hopf algebra of Feynman graphs to the Rota-Baxter\nalgebra. We obtain in this setting a description of the renormalization group.\nWe also extend the period interpretation to the case of Dirac fermions and\ngauge bosons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Aug 2013 20:01:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-28"}

In this paper we have approached the study of the structuredness of an\nRDF graph in a principled way: we propose a framework for specifying\nstructuredness functions, which gauge the degree to which an RDF graph conforms\nto a schema. In particular, we first define a formal language for specifying\nstructuredness functions with expressions we call rules.

Finally, we test this ILP solution with two real world\ndatasets, DBpedia Persons and WordNet Nouns, and 4 different and intuitive\nrules, which gauge the structuredness in different ways.

While this method has been praised by some, it has also been\ncriticized for its lack of power in finite samples. We seek to modify MIC so\nthat it has higher power in detecting associations for limited sample sizes.\nHere we present the Generalized Mean Information Coefficient (GMIC), a\ngeneralization of MIC which incorporates a tuning parameter that can be used to\nmodify the complexity of the association favored by the measure. We define GMIC\nand prove it maintains several key asymptotic properties of MIC. Its increased\npower over MIC is demonstrated using a simulation of eight different functional\nrelationships at sixty different noise levels. The results are compared to the\nPearson correlation, distance correlation, and MIC. Simulation results suggest\nthat while generally GMIC has slightly lower power than the distance\ncorrelation measure, it achieves higher power than MIC for many forms of\nunderlying association. For some functional relationships, GMIC surpasses all\nother statistics calculated. Preliminary results suggest choosing a moderate\nvalue of the tuning parameter for GMIC will yield a test that is robust across\nunderlying relationships. GMIC is a promising new method that mitigates the\npower issues suffered by MIC, at the possible expense of equitability.\nNonetheless, distance correlation was in our simulations more powerful for many\nforms of underlying relationships. At a minimum, this work motivates further\nconsideration of maximal information-based nonparametric exploration (MINE)\nmethods as statistical tests of independence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Aug 2013 22:05:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-28"}

[1,2] for compressible flow,\nand uses Robin (mixed) boundary conditions with the fluid and solid solvers at\nthe interface. The AMP Robin conditions are derived from a local characteristic\ndecomposition in the solid at the interface. Two forms of the Robin conditions\nare derived depending on whether the fluid equations are advanced with a\nfractional-step method or not. A normal mode analysis for a discretization of\nan FSI model problem is performed to show that the new AMP algorithm is stable\nfor any ratio of the solid and fluid densities, including the case of very\nlight solids when the added-mass effects are large. In contrast, it is shown\nthat a traditional partitioned algorithm involving a Dirichlet-Neumann coupling\nfor the same FSI problem is formally unconditionally unstable for any ratio of\ndensities.

The workshop is affiliated to the 12th European Conference on\nArtificial Life (ECAL 2013).\n  Systems biology aims at providing a system-level understanding of biological\nsystems by unveiling their structure, dynamics and control methods. Due to the\nintrinsic multi-scale nature of these systems in space, in organization levels\nand in time, it is extremely difficult to model them in a uniform way, e.g., by\nmeans of differential equations or discrete stochastic processes. Furthermore,\nsuch models are often not easily amenable to formal analysis, and their\nsimulations at the organ or even at the cell levels are frequently impractical.\nIndeed, an important open problem is finding appropriate computational models\nthat scale well for both simulation and formal analysis of biological\nprocesses. Hybrid modeling techniques, combining discrete and continuous\nprocesses, are gaining more and more attention in such a context, and they have\nbeen successfully applied to capture the behavior of many biological complex\nsystems, ranging from genetic networks, biochemical reactions, signaling\npathways, cardiac tissues electro-physiology, and tumor genesis. This workshop\naims at bringing together researchers in computer science, mathematics, and\nlife sciences, interested in the opportunities and the challenges of hybrid\nmodeling applied to systems biology.\n  The workshop programme included the keynote presentation of Alessandro\nAstolfi (Imperial College of London, UK) on Immune response enhancement via\nhybrid control. Furthermore, 8 papers were selected out of 13 submissions by\nthe Program Committee of HSB 2013.

By means of\n\\emph{AGBDUST} code, we estimate that $\\sim 5.2\\times10^{-4} M_\\odot$ of dust\ngrains are produced, and their radii are $\\sim 10^{-5}$ cm. These dust grains\nmainly are composed of silicate and iron grains. Because the mass of the\nbinary-merger ejecta is very small, the contribution of dust produced by\nbinary-merger ejecta to the overall dust production in the interstellar medium\nis negligible. However, it is the most important that the discovery of a\nsignificant amount of dust around V1309 Sco offers a direct support for the\nidea---common-envelope ejecta provides an ideal environment for dust formation\nand growth. Therefore, we confirm that common-envelope ejecta can be important\nsource of cosmic dust.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Aug 2013 01:47:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

One of the goals of such reconstructions is to assess if current\nclimate is anomalous in a millennial context. These regression based approaches\nmodel the conditional mean of the temperature distribution as a function of\npaleoclimate proxies (or vice versa). Some of the recent focus in the area has\nconsidered methods which help reduce the uncertainty inherent in such\nstatistical paleoclimate reconstructions, with the ultimate goal of improving\nthe confidence that can be attached to such endeavors. A second important\nscientific focus in the subject area is the area of forward models for proxies,\nthe goal of which is to understand the way paleoclimate proxies are driven by\ntemperature and other environmental variables. In this paper we introduce novel\nstatistical methodology for (1) quantile regression with autoregressive\nresidual structure, (2) estimation of corresponding model parameters, (3)\ndevelopment of a rigorous framework for specifying uncertainty estimates of\nquantities of interest, yielding (4) statistical byproducts that address the\ntwo scientific foci discussed above. Our statistical methodology demonstrably\nproduces a more robust reconstruction than is possible by using\nconditional-mean-fitting methods. Our reconstruction shares some of the common\nfeatures of past reconstructions, but also gains useful insights. More\nimportantly, we are able to demonstrate a significantly smaller uncertainty\nthan that from previous regression methods. In addition, the quantile\nregression component allows us to model, in a more complete and flexible way\nthan least squares, the conditional distribution of temperature given proxies.\nThis relationship can be used to inform forward models relating how proxies are\ndriven by temperature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Aug 2013 01:55:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-09"}

We study a\ndiscrete version of a stochastic model of the GTP cap dynamics, originally\nproposed by Flyvbjerg, Holy and Leibler (Flyvbjerg, Holy and Leibler, Phys.\nRev. Lett. 73, 2372, 1994). Our model includes both spontaneous and vectorial\nhydrolysis, as well as dissociation of a non-hydrolyzed dimer from the filament\nafter incorporation. In the first part of the paper, we apply this model to a\nsingle protofilament of a microtubule. A catastrophe transition is defined for\neach protofilament, similar to the earlier one-dimensional models, the\nfrequency of occurrence of which is then calculated under various conditions,\nbut without explicit assumption of steady state conditions. Using a\nperturbative approach, we show that the leading asymptotic behavior of the\nprotofilament catastrophe in the limit of large growth velocities is remarkably\nsimilar across different models. In the second part of the paper, we extend our\nanalysis to the entire filament by making a conjecture that a minimum number of\nsuch transitions are required to occur for the onset of microtubule\ncatastrophe. The frequency of microtubule catastrophe is then determined using\nnumerical simulations, and compared with analytical/semi-analytical estimates\nmade under steady state/quasi-steady state assumptions respectively for the\nprotofilament dynamics. A few relevant experimental results are analyzed in\ndetail, and compared with predictions from the model.

Our results show that, for sufficiently large internal\ntemperature gradients, a non-isothermal filament could present significantly\nlarger masses per unit length and shallower density profiles than the\nisothermal filament without collapsing by its own gravity. We conclude that\nfilaments can reach an equilibrium configuration under non-isothermal\nconditions.

For these systems, spectrum optimization is a\npromising means to mitigate interference. This however corresponds to a\nchallenging nonconvex optimization problem. Existing iterative convex\napproximation (ICA) methods consist in solving a series of improving convex\napproximations and are typically implemented in a per-user iterative approach.\nHowever they do not take this typical iterative implementation into account in\ntheir design. This paper proposes a novel class of iterative approximation\nmethods that focuses explicitly on the per-user iterative implementation, which\nallows to relax the problem significantly, dropping joint convexity and even\nconvexity requirements for the approximations. A systematic design framework is\nproposed to construct instances of this novel class, where several new\niterative approximation methods are developed with improved per-user convex and\nnonconvex approximations that are both tighter and simpler to solve (in\nclosed-form). As a result, these novel methods display a much faster\nconvergence speed and require a significantly lower computational cost.\nFurthermore, a majority of the proposed methods can tackle the issue of getting\nstuck in bad locally optimal solutions, and hence improve solution quality\ncompared to existing ICA methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Aug 2013 09:34:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-28"}

In this\npaper, a novel, backhaul-aware approach to interference management in wireless\nsmall cell networks is proposed. The proposed approach enables macrocell user\nequipments (MUEs) to optimize their uplink performance, by exploiting the\npresence of neighboring small cell base stations. The problem is formulated as\na noncooperative game among the MUEs that seek to optimize their delay-rate\ntradeoff, given the conditions of both the radio access network and the --\npossibly heterogeneous -- backhaul. To solve this game, a novel, distributed\nlearning algorithm is proposed using which the MUEs autonomously choose their\noptimal uplink transmission strategies, given a limited amount of available\ninformation. The convergence of the proposed algorithm is shown and its\nproperties are studied.

However, to date,\npractical statistical methods which can include group dynamics in animal\nmovement models have been lacking. We consider a flexible modelling framework\nthat distinguishes a group-level model, describing the movement of the group's\ncentre, and an individual-level model, such that each individual makes its\nmovement decisions relative to the group centroid. The basic idea is framed\nwithin the flexible class of hidden Markov models, extending previous work on\nmodelling animal movement by means of multi-state random walks. While in\nsimulation experiments parameter estimators exhibit some bias in non-ideal\nscenarios, we show that generally the estimation of models of this type is both\nfeasible and ecologically informative. We illustrate the approach using real\nmovement data from 11 reindeer (Rangifer tarandus). Results indicate a\ndirectional bias towards a group centroid for reindeer in an encamped state.\nThough the attraction to the group centroid is relatively weak, our model\nsuccessfully captures group-influenced movement dynamics. Specifically, as\ncompared to a regular mixture of correlated random walks, the group dynamic\nmodel more accurately predicts the non-diffusive behaviour of a cohesive mobile\ngroup.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Aug 2013 12:52:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-21"}

Gitti et al. suggested that this peculiar radio morphology may\nindicate a recurrent activity of the central radio source, where the jet\norientation is changing between the different outbursts due to the effects of\nsupermassive binary black holes (SMBBHs). We aim at unveiling the nuclear radio\nproperties of the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) in RBS 797 and at\ninvestigating the presence of a SMBBH system in its center. We have performed\nnew high-resolution observations at 5 GHz with the European VLBI Network (EVN),\nreaching an angular resolution of 9x5 mas^2 and a sensitivity of 36\nmicroJy/beam. We report the EVN detection of two compact components in the BCG\nof RBS 797, with a projected separation of ~77 pc. We can envisage two possible\nscenarios: the two components are two different nuclei in a close binary\nsystem, or they are the core and a knot of its jet. Both interpretations are\nconsistent with the presence of SMBBHs. Our re-analysis of VLA archival data\nseems to favor the first scenario, as we detect two pairs of radio jets\nmisaligned by ~90 degrees on the same kpc scale emanating from the central\nradio core. If the two outbursts are almost contemporaneous, this is clear\nevidence of the presence of two active SMBHs, whose radio nuclei are unresolved\nat VLA resolution. The nature of the double source detected by our EVN\nobservations in the BCG of RBS 797 can be established only by future sensitive,\nmulti-frequency VLBI observations. If confirmed, RBS 797 would be the first\nSMBBH system observed at medium-high redshift at VLBI resolution.

The restrictions imposed by common principles such as\nelectromagnetic gauge invariance and hermiticity are studied, and the\nimplications due to the discrete space-time symmetries or the Majorana\ncondition are deduced when they are applicable. In some cases certain features\nof the vertex function are analogous to the known ones for the spin-1/2 or\nspin-1 particles, but we find and discuss other particular properties which are\nrelated to the spin-3/2 Rarita-Schwinger representation. For example, in the\ndiagonal Majorana case, the vertex function can contain a term of the form\n$\\gamma_\\mu\\gamma_5$, which resembles the axial charge radius term for Majorana\nneutrinos, plus another one that resembles the vertex function for\nself-conjugate spin-1 particles, but with the particularity that the two terms\nmay not appear independently of each other, but instead with a specific\nrelative coefficient. In essence this is due to the requirement that the vertex\nfunction does not mix the genuine spin-3/2 degrees of freedom with the spurious\nspin-1/2 components of the Rarita-Schwinger representation. The analogous\nresults for the other cases (off-diagonal and charged couplings) are discussed\nas well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Aug 2013 14:57:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

For the\nfilamentation instability we show that the effective growth rates measured on\nthe total energy can differ by more than 50% from the linear cold predictions\nand from the fastest modes of the simulation.\n  Second, we detail a new method for initial loading of Maxwell-J\\\"uttner\nparticle distributions with relativistic bulk velocity and relativistic\ntemperature, and explain why the traditional method with individual particle\nboosting fails.\n  Third, we scrutinize the question of what description of physical plasmas is\nobtained by PIC models. These models rely on two building blocks:\ncoarse-graining, i.e., grouping of the order of p~10^10 real particles into a\nsingle computer superparticle, and field storage on a grid with its subsequent\nfinite superparticle size. We introduce the notion of coarse-graining dependent\nquantities, i.e., quantities depending on p. They derive from the PIC plasma\nparameter Lambda^{PIC}, which we show to scale as 1/p. We explore two\nimplications. One is that PIC collision- and fluctuation-induced thermalization\ntimes are expected to scale with the number of superparticles per grid cell,\nand thus to be a factor p~10^10 smaller than in real plasmas. The other is that\nthe level of electric field fluctuations scales as 1/Lambda^{PIC} ~ p. We\nprovide a corresponding exact expression.\n  Fourth, we compare the Vlasov-Maxwell theory, which describes a phase-space\nfluid with infinite Lambda, to the PIC model and its relatively small Lambda.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Aug 2013 15:06:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-12"}

Such an algebra starts with a po-group $G$, a set $I$\nand with two bijections $\\lambda,\\rho:I \\to I.$ Using a clever construction on\nthe ordinal sum of $(G^+)^I$ and $(G^-)^I,$ we can define a pseudo effect\nalgebra which can be non-commutative even if $G$ is an Abelian po-group. In the\npaper we give a characterization of subdirect product of subdirectly\nirreducible kite pseudo effect algebras, and we show that every kite pseudo\neffect algebra is an interval in a unital po-loop.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Aug 2013 18:05:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

The aim of the study was the analysis and interpretation\nof the Early Bronze Age petroglyphs using archaeoastronomical methods. The\narticle presents a comparative analysis of Skelnovsky grotto ancient images and\ncontemporary eyewitness accounts of the Sikhote-Alin meteorite fall and\nmeteorite shower. Some petroglyphs were interpreted by us using ethnographic\nand folklore material. In this study, the magnetic declination for the\ngeographical coordinates Skelnovsky farm was calculated, and the projection of\nthe whole picture Skelnovskih petroglyphs on the topographical map of the area\nwas built. The proposed location of the meteorite fall was determined with this\nprojection. It is confirmed by satellite pictures, on which are the\ndistinguishable terrain features, typical for the meteorite fall, are visible\nincluding the possible impact crater, and the corresponding symbols on a\ntopographical map. The studies in the article conclude the astronomical\ncharacter of the main content of the Skelnovsky petroglyphs picture which\ndepicts the fall of a large meteoroid (bolide), similar to the Sikhote-Alin\nmeteorite, accompanied by a meteorite shower. After a comparative analysis of\nthe images in Sklenovsky Grotto it was discovered that the petroglyph is a copy\nof the figure depicted on the famous Mesopotamic clay tablet YBC 7289.

The convergence and stability of the\nmodel are first proven by using new mathematical tools, which are borrowed\ndirectly from chemical theory, and then validated by means of simulation\nresults, for different network topologies and number of sensors. The underlying\nchemical theory is also used to derive simple interaction rules that may\naccount for practical issues, such as the estimation of the number of neighbors\nand the robustness against perturbations. Finally, the proposed chemical\nsolution is validated under real-world conditions by means of a four-node\nhardware implementation where the exchange of information among nodes takes\nplace in a distributed manner (with no need for any admission control and\nsynchronism procedure), simply relying on the transmission of a pulse whose\nrate is proportional to the state of each sensor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Aug 2013 08:51:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}
