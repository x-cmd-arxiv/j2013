Fourier\ntransform-based spectroscopies have been particularly successful, yet\n'complete' spectral information normally necessitates the loss of all\ninformation on the temporal sequence of events in a signal. This information\nthough is particularly important in transient or multi-stage processes, in\nwhich the spectral decomposition of the data evolves in time. By going through\nseveral examples of ultrafast quantum dynamics, we demonstrate that the use of\nwavelets provide an efficient and accurate way to simultaneously acquire both\ntemporal and frequency information about a signal, and argue that this greatly\naids the elucidation and interpretation of physical process responsible for\nnon-stationary spectroscopic features, such as those encountered in coherent\nexcitonic energy transport.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Aug 2013 16:06:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-10"}

Comparing modified stellar evolution sequences with\nobservations provides some of the most restrictive limits on axions and other\nhypothetical low-mass particles and on non-standard neutrino properties. In\nparticular, a putative neutrino magnetic dipole moment mu_nu enhances the\nplasmon decay process, postpones helium ignition in low-mass stars, and\ntherefore extends the red-giant branch (RGB) in globular clusters (GCs). The\nbrightness of the tip of the RGB (TRGB) remains the most sensitive probe for\nmu_nu and we revisit this argument from a modern perspective. Based on a large\nset of archival observations, we provide high-precision photometry for the\nGalactic GC M5 (NGC5904) and carefully determine its TRGB position. On the\ntheoretical side, we add the extra plasmon decay rate brought about by mu_nu to\nthe Princeton-Goddard-PUC stellar evolution code. Different sources of\nuncertainty are critically examined. The main source of systematic uncertainty\nis the bolometric correction and the main statistical uncertainty derives from\nthe distance modulus based on main-sequence fitting. (Other measures of\ndistance, e.g., the brightness of RR Lyrae stars, are influenced by the energy\nloss that we wish to constrain.) The statistical uncertainty of the TRGB\nposition relative to the brightest RGB star is less important because the RGB\nis well populated. We infer an absolute I-band brightness of M_I=-4.17+/-0.13\nmag for the TRGB compared with the theoretical prediction of -3.99+/-0.07 mag,\nin reasonable agreement with each other. A significant brightness increase\ncaused by neutrino dipole moments is constrained such that\nmu_nu<2.6x10^-12mu_B(68% CL), where mu_B is the Bohr magneton, and\nmu_nu<4.5x10^-12 mu_B(95% CL).

In the SM, FCNC are forbidden at three level, but arise through\ncalculable one-loop contributions. We review some of the features of FCNC in\ntwo examples of minimal extensions of the SM. In the first example, we consider\nan extension of the SM consisting of the addition of one vector-like quark\neither of the up-type ($Q=2/3$) or the down type ($Q=- 1/3$). In this extension\nthere are non-vanishing but naturally suppressed Z-mediated FCNC at tree level.\nIn the second example, we discuss extensions of the SM with two Higgs doublets,\nwithout the assumption of natural flavour conservation, giving rise to Higgs\nmediated FCNC. The existence of strict experimental limits on processes\nsensitive to Higgs FCNC requires a strong suppression of these currents. We\npresent scenarios resulting from discrete symmetries where all new flavour\nstructures in the quark sector are parametrized by elements of the\nCabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix, together with the ratio of vacuum\nexpectation values of the Higgs doublets in the Higgs basis defined by the\nsymmetry.

We use the Bayesian approach to parameter\nestimation, in which a posterior probability density describes the probability\nof the parameter conditioned on data and compute an empirical estimate of this\nposterior with implicit sampling. Our approach generates independent samples,\nso that some of the practical difficulties one encounters with Markov Chain\nMonte Carlo methods, e.g.~burn-in time or correlations among dependent samples,\nare avoided.

Previously, theory implied that the BH would segregate into a compact\nsystem with short dynamical time scales, and that the BH would escape long\nbefore the present. But stellar systems can exist in a state of balanced\nevolution, where the energy generated in the core is regulated by the process\nof two-body relaxation in the bulk of the system.

Coriolis forces from\ndifferential rotation (DR) play a large role in determining what the meridional\ncirculation is. Here we consider whether a stellar DR that is constant on\ncylinders concentric with the rotation axis can drive a meridional\ncirculation.Conventional wisdom says that it can not. Using two related forms\nof governing equations that respectively estimate the longitudinal components\nof the curl of meridional mass flux and the vorticity, we show that such DR\nwill drive a meridional flow. This is because to satisfy anelastic mass\nconservation, non-spherically symmetric pressure contours must be present for\nall DRs, not just ones that depart from constancy on cylinders concentric with\nthe rotation axis. Therefore the fluid is always baroclinic if DR is present,\nbecause, in anelastic systems, the perturbation pressure must satisfy a Poisson\ntype equation, as well as an equation of state and a thermodynamic equation. We\nsupport our qualitative reasoning with numerical examples, and show that\nmeridional circulation is sensitive to the magnitude and form of departures\nfrom rotation constant on cylinders. The effect should be present in 3D global\nanelastic convection simulations, particularly those for which the DR driven by\nglobal convection is nearly cylindrical in profile. For solar-like DR, Coriolis\nforces generally drive a two-celled circulation in each hemisphere, with a\nsecond, reversed flow at high latitudes. For solar like turbulent viscosities,\nthe meridional circulation produced by Coriolis forces is much larger than\nobserved on the Sun. Therefore there must be at least one additional force,\nprobably a buoyancy force, which opposes the meridional flow to bring its\namplitude down to observed values.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Aug 2013 19:20:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

The effect of the degree of\nfunctionalization and molecular structure on the Young's modulus and strength\nare investigated, and the failure processes of some new GAs are reported for\nthe first time. We show that the mechanical properties of the hydrogenated GAs\ndeteriorate drastically with increasing H-coverage within the sensitive\nthreshold, beyond which the mechanical properties remain insensitive to the\nincrease in H-coverage. This drastic deterioration arises both from the\nconversion of sp2 to sp3 bonding and easy rotation of unsupported sp3 bonds.\nAllotropes with different lattice structures correspond to different sensitive\nthresholds. The Young's moduli deterioration of fully hydrogenated allotropes\ncan be up to 70% smaller than that of the corresponding pristine structure.\nMoreover the tensile strength shows an even larger drop of about 90% and higher\nsensitivity to H-coverage even if it is small.

Values for Q^{-1} above T_c\nare temperature independent and have a weak pressure dependence. Below T_c, a\ndeliberate axial compression of the aerogel by 10% widens the range of\nmetastability for a superfluid Equal Spin Pairing (ESP) state; we observe this\nESP phase on cooling and the B phase on warming over an extended temperature\nregion. While the dissipation for the B phase tends to zero as T goes to 0,\nQ^{-1} exhibits a peak value greater than that at T_c at intermediate\ntemperatures. Values for Q^{-1} in the ESP phase are consistently higher than\nin the B phase and are proportional to \\rho_s/\\rho until the ESP to B phase\ntransition is attained. We apply a viscoelastic collision-drag model, which\ncouples the motion of the helium and the aerogel through a frictional\nrelaxation time \\tau_f.

The result is that an\nadditional mechanism to dissipate energy not captured in the collision-drag\nmodel and related to the emergence of the superfluid order must exist. The\nextra dissipation below T_c is possibly associated with mutual friction between\nthe superfluid phases and the clamped normal fluid. The pressure dependence of\nthe measured dissipation in both superfluid phases is likely related to the\npressure dependence of the gap structure of the \"dirty\" superfluid.

Our\nmain results are: a) The stellar-to-halo mass ratio is ~0.01 and remains\nroughly constant since z~1 (the stellar MAHs follow closely the halo MAHs),\nwith a smaller value at higher z's for those halos that assemble their mass\nlater. b) The evolution of the galaxy gas fraction, fg, is episodic and higher,\nmost of the time, than the stellar fraction. When fg decreases (increases), the\ngas fraction in the halo typically increases (decreases), showing that the SN\ndriven outflows play an important role in regulating the gas fractions -and\nhence the SFR- of the dwarfs. However, in most cases, an important fraction of\nthe gas escapes the virial radius, Rv; at z=4 the total baryon fraction inside\nRv is 1.5-2 times smaller than the universal one, while at z=0 is 2-6 times\nsmaller, with the earlier assembled halos ejecting more gas. c) The SF\nhistories are episodic with changes in the SFRs of factors 2-10 on average. d)\nAlthough the dwarfs formed in late assembled halos show more extended SF\nhistories, their z~0 SFRs are still below the ones measured for local isolated\ndwarfs. e) The effects of baryons on Mv are such that at almost any time Mv is\n10-20% smaller than the corresponding Mv obtained in pure N-body simulations.\nOur results suggest that rather than increasing the strength of the SN-driven\noutflows, processes that reduce the SF efficiency even more will help to solve\nthe potential issues faced by the CDM-based simulations of dwarfs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Aug 2013 02:47:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Nov 2013 03:48:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 27 Mar 2014 20:54:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-31"}

They modify Higgs properties, in particular how the Higgs couples to top\nquarks. Alas, there is a low-energy cancellation acting in the coupling of the\nHiggs boson to gluons and photons. As a result of this cancellation, no\ninformation about the spectrum and couplings of the top-partners can be\nobtained in gluon fusion to Higgs, just the overall new physics scale. In this\npaper we show that this is not the case when hard radiation is taken into\naccount. Indeed, differential distributions in Higgs plus jets are sensitive to\nthe top-partner mass and coupling to the Higgs. We exploit the transverse\nmomentum distribution of the hard jet to obtain limits on the top-partners in\nthe 14 TeV LHC run, finding that 300 ifb of data of 14 TeV LHC are sufficient\nto rule out top-sector mixing angles $\\sin^2 (\\theta_R)$ > 0.05 for\ntop-partners with masses from 300 GeV to above 2 TeV.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Aug 2013 06:28:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

Why?\nPrevious explanations have focused on the adaptive limits of combinatorial\ncommunication, or on its purported cognitive difficulties, but neither of these\nexplains the full distribution of combinatorial communication in the natural\nworld. Here we present a nonlinear dynamical model of the emergence of\ncombinatorial communication that, unlike previous models, considers how\ninitially non-communicative behaviour evolves to take on a communicative\nfunction. We derive three basic principles about the emergence of combinatorial\ncommunication. We hence show that the interdependence of signals and responses\nplaces significant constraints on the historical pathways by which\ncombinatorial signals might emerge, to the extent that anything other than the\nmost simple form of combinatorial communication is extremely unlikely. We also\nargue that these constraints can be bypassed if individuals have the\nsocio-cognitive capacity to engage in ostensive communication. Humans, but\nprobably no other species, have this ability. This may explain why language,\nwhich is massively combinatorial, is such an extreme exception to nature's\ngeneral trend for non-combinatorial communication.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Aug 2013 07:29:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-26"}

We apply our models\nto discrete proper-motion and line-of-sight-velocity data of Galactic globular\ncluster omega Centauri and find a mildly radial velocity anisotropy beta = 0.10\n+/- 0.02, an inclination angle i = 50 +/- 1 deg, a V-band mass-to-light ratio\nUpsilon = 2.71 +/- 0.05 Msun/Lsun and a distance d = 4.59 +/- 0.08 kpc. All\nparameters are in agreement with previous studies, demonstrating the\nfeasibility of our methods. We find that the models return lower distances and\nhigher mass-to-light ratios than expected when we include proper motion stars\nwith high errors or for which there is some blending. We believe this not a\nfault of our models but is instead due to underestimates or missing systematic\nuncertainties in the provided errors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Aug 2013 08:37:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

They are important examples of cooperation\nshaped by evolution. Mutualism between animals and plants plays a key role in\nthe organization of ecological communities. Such networks in ecology have\ngenerically evolved a nested architecture independent of species composition\nand latitude - specialists interact with proper subsets of the nodes with whom\ngeneralists interact. Despite sustained efforts to explain observed network\nstructure on the basis of community-level stability or persistence, such\ncorrelative studies have reached minimal consensus. Here we demonstrate that\nnested interaction networks could emerge as a consequence of an optimization\nprinciple aimed at maximizing the species abundance in mutualistic communities.\nUsing analytical and numerical approaches, we show that because of the\nmutualistic interactions, an increase in abundance of a given species results\nin a corresponding increase in the total number of individuals in the\ncommunity, as also the nestedness of the interaction matrix. Indeed, the\nspecies abundances and the nestedness of the interaction matrix are correlated\nby an amount that depends on the strength of the mutualistic interactions.\nNestedness and the observed spontaneous emergence of generalist and specialist\nspecies occur for several dynamical implementations of the variational\nprinciple under stationary conditions. Optimized networks, while remaining\nstable, tend to be less resilient than their counterparts with randomly\nassigned interactions. In particular, we analytically show that the abundance\nof the rarest species is directly linked to the resilience of the community.\nOur work provides a unifying framework for studying the emergent structural and\ndynamical properties of ecological mutualistic networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Aug 2013 09:43:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-23"}

The decline has been weaker in the March maximum than\nin the September minimum and masked by inter-annual fluctuations. One of the\nless understood aspects of the sea ice response is the persistence times for\nfluctuations, which could indicate the dominant physical processes behind the\nsea ice decline. To determine the fluctuation persistence times, however, it is\nnecessary to first filter out the dominant effect of the seasonal cycle. In the\ncurrent study, we thus develop a statistical model, which accurately decomposes\nthe ice area changes into: (1) a variable seasonal cycle component with a\nconstant shape and (2) a residual (short term) fluctuation.\n  We find the persistence time of fluctuations to be only about three weeks,\nindependently from season, which is substantially shorter than previously\nreported. Such short time scale points to the dominance of atmospheric forcing.\nThe shape of the seasonal cycle is surprisingly constant for the whole\nobservational record despite the rapid decline. This is in agreement with the\nsuggestion that the asymmetry of the seasonal cycle is an effect of Arctic\nland-sea geography, which has not changed with climate change.\n  The analysis suggest a jump in the annual sea ice area amplitude occurring in\n2007, from which it has not yet recovered, possibly revealing a permanent\namplitude shift. In physical sense, this could imply a shift towards the\nyounger, thinner and more susceptible ice cover commencing after the immense\n2007 multi-year ice loss.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Aug 2013 11:13:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-23"}

Here, we present multi-dimensional\nradiative transfer simulations that provide synthetic light curves and spectra\nfor those models. The model sequence explores both changes in the strength of\nthe deflagration phase (controlled by the ignition configuration) and the WD\ncentral density. In agreement with previous studies, we find that the strength\nof the deflagration significantly affects the explosion and the observables.\nVariations in the central density also have an influence on both brightness and\ncolour, but overall it is a secondary parameter in our set of models. In many\nrespects, the models yield a good match to normal Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia):\npeak brightness, rise/decline time scales and synthetic spectra are all in\nreasonable agreement. There are, however, several differences. In particular,\nthe models are too red around maximum light, manifest spectral line velocities\nthat are a little too high and yield I-band light curves that do not match\nobservations. Although some of these discrepancies may simply relate to\napproximations made in the modelling, some pose real challenges to the models.\nIf viewed as a complete sequence, our models do not reproduce the observed\nlight-curve width-luminosity relation (WLR) of SNe Ia: all our models show\nsimilar B-band decline rates, irrespective of peak brightness. This suggests\nthat simple variations in the strength of the deflagration phase in\nChandrasekhar-mass deflagration-to-detonation models do not readily explain the\nobserved diversity of normal SNe Ia. This may imply that some other parameter\nwithin the Chandrasekhar-mass paradigm is key to the WLR, or that a substantial\nfraction of normal SNe Ia arise from an alternative explosion scenario.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Aug 2013 11:46:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

Decreasing the index size is a\ndirect way to decrease this query response time.\n  Static index pruning methods reduce the size of indexes by removing a part of\nthe postings. In the context of web archives, it is necessary to remove\npostings while preserving the temporal diversity of the archive.

We aim at pruning the index while\npreserving retrieval effectiveness and diversity by pruning while maximizing a\ngiven IR evaluation metric like DCG.

To study the\ntransit behaviour of Universe, we consider a law of variation of scale factor\n$a(t) = \\left(t^{k} e^{t}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{n}}$ which yields a time dependent\ndeceleration parameter $q = - 1 + \\frac{nk}{(k + t)^{2}}$, comprising a class\nof models that depicts a transition of the universe from the early decelerated\nphase to the recent accelerating phase.

This approach assumes that there is an underlying\nlatent space in which the actors follow a finite mixture distribution.\nMoreover, actors which are close in this latent space tend to be tied by an\nedge. This is an appealing approach since it allows the model to cluster actors\nwhich consequently provides the practitioner with useful qualitative\ninformation. However, exploring the uncertainty in the number of underlying\nlatent components in the mixture distribution is a very complex task. The\ncurrent state-of-the-art is to use an approximate form of BIC for this purpose,\nwhere an approximation of the log-likelihood is used instead of the true\nlog-likelihood which is unavailable. The main contribution of this paper is to\nshow that through the use of conjugate prior distributions it is possible to\nanalytically integrate out almost all of the model parameters, leaving a\nposterior distribution which depends on the allocation vector of the mixture\nmodel. A consequence of this is that it is possible to carry out posterior\ninference over the number of components in the latent mixture distribution\nwithout using trans-dimensional MCMC algorithms such as reversible jump MCMC.\nMoreover, our algorithm allows for more reasonable computation times for larger\nnetworks than the standard methods using the latentnet package (Krivitsky and\nHandcock 2008; Krivitsky and Handcock 2013).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Aug 2013 14:10:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-23"}

Numerical calculations with a detailed\nstellar evolution code were used for the first time to study the combined pre-\nand post-AIC evolution of close binaries. We investigated the mass transfer\nonto a massive WD in 240 systems with three different types of non-degenerate\ndonor stars: main-sequence stars, red giants, and helium stars.

We improve on the previous\nresults about this system by showing that after a relatively short time period\nthe average kinetic temperature profile satisfies the dynamic Fourier's law in\na local microscopic sense without assuming that the initial data is close to a\nlocal equilibrium state. The bounds derived here prove that the above\nthermalization period is at most of the order L^(2/3), where L denotes the\nnumber of particles in the chain. In particular, even before the diffusive time\nscale Fourier's law becomes a valid approximation of the evolution of the\nkinetic temperature profile. As a second application of the dynamic replica\nmethod, we also briefly discuss replacing the velocity flips by an anharmonic\nonsite potential.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Aug 2013 15:33:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 Dec 2013 15:19:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

Soliton modes are constructed, and their\nstability is investigated (by means of the linearization and direct\nsimulations) in semi-infinite and finite gaps in the corresponding spectrum,\nstarting from the bifurcation which generates the solitons from edges of the\ngaps' edges. Families of solitons embedded into the conttinuous spectrum of the\nSH component are found too, and it is demonstrated that a part of the families\nof these \\textit{embedded solitons} (ESs) is stable. The analysis is focused on\neffects produced by the variation of the strength of the imaginary part of the\npotential, which is a specific characteristic of the $\\mathcal{PT}$ system.

However, such systems pose several challenges for HDR\nreconstruction algorithms. Previous reconstruction techniques have considered\ndebayering, denoising, resampling (align- ment) and exposure fusion as separate\nproblems. In contrast, in this paper we present a unifying approach, performing\nHDR assembly directly from raw sensor data. Our framework includes a camera\nnoise model adapted to HDR video and an algorithm for spatially adaptive HDR\nreconstruction based on fitting of local polynomial approximations to observed\nsensor data. The method is easy to implement and allows reconstruction to an\narbitrary resolution and output mapping. We present an implementation in CUDA\nand show real-time performance for an experimental 4 Mpixel multi-sensor HDR\nvideo system. We further show that our algorithm has clear advantages over\nexisting methods, both in terms of flexibility and reconstruction quality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Aug 2013 15:58:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-23"}

Later, Kalb\nand Ramond (and others) developed this theoretical concept. And, at the present\ntimes it is widely accepted. We analyze the quantum theory of antisymmetric\ntensor fields with taking into account mass dimensions of notoph and photon. It\nappears to be possible to describe both photon and notoph degrees of freedom on\nthe basis of the modified Bargmann-Wigner formalism for the symmetric\nsecond-rank spinor. Next, we proceed to derive equations for the symmetric\ntensor of the second rank on the basis of the Bargmann-Wigner formalism in a\nstraightforward way. The symmetric multispinor of the fourth rank is used. It\nis constructed out of the Dirac 4-spinors. Due to serious problems with the\ninterpretation of the results obtained on using the standard procedure we\ngeneralize it and obtain the spin-2 relativistic equations, which are\nconsistent with the general relativity. The importance of the 4-vector field\n(and its gauge part) is pointed out. Thus, we present the full theory which\ncontains photon, notoph (the Kalb-Ramond field) and the graviton. The relations\nof this theory with the higher spin theories are established. In fact, we\ndeduced the gravitational field equations from relativistic quantum mechanics.\nWe estimate possible interactions, fermion-notoph, graviton-notoph,\nphoton-notoph.
