We study\nfermionic extended Hubbard models in a one dimensional lattice with different\ntypes of particle couplings, including also three- and four-body interaction up\nto nearest neighboring sites. By using the Bosonization technique, we\ninvestigate the low-energy regime and determine the conditions for the\nappearance of ordered phases, for arbitrary particle filling. We find that\nthree- and four-body couplings may significantly modify the phase diagram. In\nparticular, diagonal three-body terms that directly couple the local particle\ndensities have qualitatively different effects from off-diagonal three-body\ncouplings originating from correlated hopping, and favor the appearance of a\nLuther-Emery phase even when two-body terms are repulsive. Furthermore, the\nfour-body coupling gives rise to a rich phase diagram and may lead to the\nrealization of the Haldane insulator phase at half-filling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Aug 2013 16:06:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

From the behaviour of the amount of\nline depolarization as a function of line strength, the intrinsic continuum\nlight polarization of WR1 is estimated to be P/I=0.443 \\pm 0.028 % with an\nangle of \\theta=-26.2^o.\n  Although such a level of polarization could in principle be caused by a wind\nflattened by fast rotation, the scenario in which it is a consequence of the\npresence in the wind of Corotating Interaction Regions (CIRs) is preferred.\nThis is supported by previous photometric and spectroscopic observations\nshowing periodic variations with a period of 16.9 days. This is now the third\nWR star thought to exhibit CIRs in its wind that is found to have line\ndepolarization. Previous authors have found a strong correlation between line\ndepolarization and the presence of an ejected nebula, which they interpret as a\nsign that the star has reached the WR phase relatively recently since the\nnebula are thought to dissipate very fast. In the cases where the presence of\nCIRs in the wind is favoured to explain the depolarization across spectral\nlines, the above mentioned correlation may be indicating that those massive\nstars have only very recently transited from the previous evolutionary phase to\nthe WR phase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Aug 2013 16:23:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

The importance of this theorem stems from the\nfact that eigenvalue problems on such matrices arise in many fields of science\nand engineering, including dynamical systems theory, economics, statistics and\noptimization. However, many real-life scenarios give rise to nonsquare\nmatrices. A natural question is whether the PF Theorem (along with its\napplications) can be generalized to a nonsquare setting. Our paper provides a\ngeneralization of the PF Theorem to nonsquare matrices. The extension can be\ninterpreted as representing client-server systems with additional degrees of\nfreedom, where each client may choose between multiple servers that can\ncooperate in serving it (while potentially interfering with other clients).\nThis formulation is motivated by applications to power control in wireless\nnetworks, economics and others, all of which extend known examples for the use\nof the original PF Theorem.\n  We show that the option of cooperation between servers does not improve the\nsituation, in the sense that in the optimal solution no cooperation is needed,\nand only one server needs to serve each client. Hence, the additional power of\nhaving several potential servers per client translates into \\emph{choosing} the\nbest single server and not into \\emph{sharing} the load between the servers in\nsome way, as one might have expected.\n  The two main contributions of the paper are (i) a generalized PF Theorem that\ncharacterizes the optimal solution for a non-convex nonsquare problem, and (ii)\nan algorithm for finding the optimal solution in polynomial time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Aug 2013 16:26:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-28"}

The decoding process of such schemes is mismatched, since it is\naware of only the large codebook. This study models such schemes by a random\ncode construction and derives achievable bounds on the transmission rate under\nmatched and mismatched decoding. For matched decoding the bound is obtained\nusing a modified asymptotic equipartition property (AEP) theorem derived to\nsuit this particular code construction. For mismatched decoding, relying on the\nlarge codebook performance is generally wrong, since the performance of the\nnon-typical codewords within the large codebook may differ substantially from\nthe typical ones. Hence, we present two novel lower bounds on the capacity\nunder mismatched decoding.

However,\nlittle is known about the launching and driving mechanism for these jets, whose\nmomentum and energy often far exceed the energy that can be provided by\nradiation pressure alone.

We have argued that during and after core neon burning, internal\ngravity waves excited by core convection can tap into the core fusion power and\ntransport a super-Eddington energy flux out to the stellar envelope,\npotentially unbinding up to ~ 1 solar mass of material. In this work, we\nexplore the internal conditions of SN progenitors using the MESA 1-D stellar\nevolution code, in search of those most susceptible to wave-driven mass loss.\nWe focus on simple, order of magnitude considerations applicable to a wide\nrange of progenitors. Wave-driven mass loss during core neon and oxygen fusion\nhappens preferentially in either lower mass (<~ 20 solar mass ZAMS) stars or\nmassive, sub-solar metallicity stars. Roughly 20 per cent of the SN progenitors\nwe survey can excite ~ 10^46 - 10^48 erg of energy in waves that can\npotentially drive mass loss within a few months to a decade of core collapse.\nThis energy can generate a circumstellar environment with 10^-3 - 1 solar mass\nreaching ~ 100 AU before explosion. We predict a correlation between the energy\nassociated with pre-SN mass ejection and the time to core collapse, with the\nmost intense mass loss preferentially happening closer to core collapse. During\nsilicon burning, a ~ 5 day long phase for our progenitor models, wave energy\nmay inflate ~ 10^-3 - 1 solar mass of the stellar envelope to ~ 10 - 100s of\nsolar radii. This suggests that some nominally compact SN progenitors (Type Ibc\nprogenitors) will have a significantly different SN shock breakout signature\nthan traditionally assumed. We discuss the implications of our results for the\ncore-collapse SN mechanism, Type IIn SNe, Type IIb SNe from extended\nprogenitors (e.g., SNe 1993j and 2011dh), and observed pre-SN outbursts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Aug 2013 20:02:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

HD 85567 is an enigmatic object exhibiting the B[e] phenomenon, i.e.\nan infrared excess and forbidden emission lines in the optical. The object's\nevolutionary status is uncertain and there are conflicting claims that it is\neither a young stellar object or an evolved, interacting binary.\n  Aims. To elucidate the reason for the B[e] behaviour of HD 85567, we have\nobserved it with the VLTI and AMBER.\n  Methods. Our observations were conducted in the K-band with moderate spectral\nresolution (R~1500, i.e. 200 km/s). The spectrum of HD 85567 exhibits Br gamma\nand CO overtone bandhead emission. The interferometric data obtained consist of\nspectrally dispersed visibilities, closure phases and differential phases\nacross these spectral features and the K-band continuum.\n  Results. The closure phase observations do not reveal evidence of asymmetry.\nThe apparent size of HD 85567 in the K-band was determined by fitting the\nvisibilities with a ring model. The best fitting radius, 0.8 +/- 0.3 AU, is\nrelatively small making HD 85567 undersized in comparison to the\nsize-luminosity relationship based on YSOs of low and intermediate luminosity.\nThis has previously been found to be the case for luminous YSOs, and it has\nbeen proposed that this is due to the presence of an optically thick gaseous\ndisc. We demonstrate that the differential phase observations over the CO\nbandhead emission are indeed consistent with the presence of a compact (~1 AU)\ngaseous disc interior to the dust sublimation radius.\n  Conclusions. The observations reveal no sign of binarity. However, the data\ndo indicate the presence of a gaseous disc interior to the dust sublimation\nradius. We conclude that the data are consistent with the hypothesis that HD\n85567 is a YSO with an optically thick gaseous disc within a larger dust disc\nthat is being photo-evaporated from the outer edge.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Aug 2013 21:31:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

With multiple strategies available\nfor acquisition of this nondimensional property, fluidity may serve as a useful\nand robust parameter for distinguishing cell populations, and for understanding\nthe physical origins of deformability in soft matter. Here, for three disparate\neukaryotic cell types deformed in the suspended state via optical stretching,\nwe examine the dependence of fluidity on chemical and environmental influences\naround a time scale of 1 s.

The reduction of the IPVA to the\nCMT is quite straightforward. As shown in the paper, in IVUS the circular means\ncan be recovered from measurements by solving a certain Volterra integral\nequation. Thus, a tomography reconstruction in both modalities requires solving\nthe exterior problem for the CMT.\n  Numerical solution of this problem usually is not attempted due to the\npresence of \"invisible\" wavefronts, which results in severe instability of the\nreconstruction. The novel inversion algorithm proposed in this paper yields a\nstable partial reconstruction: it reproduces the \"visible\" part of the image\nand blurs the \"invisible\" part. If the image contains little or no invisible\nwavefronts (as frequently happens in the IVPA and IVUS) the reconstruction is\nquantitatively accurate. The presented numerical simulations demonstrate the\nfeasibility of tomography-like reconstruction in these modalities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Aug 2013 23:43:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-29"}

The\nformation of channel segregation is generally attributed to the solute\npartition and the interdendritic thermosolutal convection in the mushy zone. In\nthis article, the channel segregation in a steel ingot was carefully\ncharacterized by detailed experimental observation. A different formation\nmechanism for the channel segregation was revealed. In the mushy zone of the\ningot, large amount of separate MnS inclusions move laterally and upwards. Some\nMnS inclusions will remain in the moving trace of inclusions. Such residual MnS\ninclusions appear as large amount of separate MnS inclusion chains. In the\nsubsequent solid phase transition process, promoted by the MnS chains, ferrite\nprefers to forms form the austenite near the MnS inclusions and shows as large\namount of separate ferrite chains. Large amount of ferrite chains align in a\nstrip-like zone, which results in so called channel segregation in\nmacro-etching.

Therefore, AQP1 has been proposed as a novel\npromoter of tumor angiogenesis. Methods/Findings: Using targeted silencing of\nAQP1 gene expression, an impairment in the organization of F-actin and a\nreduced migration capacity was demonstrated in human endothelial and melanoma\ncell lines.

The derivation starts from a most\ngeneral $3 \\times 3$ mass matrix $M$ containing eighteen parameters, which\napplies to all fermion types, and then reduces the number of parameters down to\nfive with a Hermitian condition modified in this manuscript between the real\npart and imaginary part of $M$. All matrix pairs thus derived will be\ndiagonalized simultaneously by a same $U$ matrix which means FCNCs won't appear\nat tree-level anymore. Subsequently, an assumption of $A=A_1=A_2=A_3$ is\nimposed and four special solutions are thus found which reveal $S_3$ and $S_2$\nsymmetries among fermion generations respectively. Consequently, as a\nby-product of solving the FCNC problem, complex CKM matrices appear if the\nsymmetries were assigned to up- and down-type quarks suitably. Unfortunately,\nCKM elements thus derived are very different to the experimentally detected\nvalues. The CP strength of this model, estimated by the Jarlskog invariant, is\nfour orders higher than the one predicted by the standard model. This\ndifference is in fact reasonable since we don't see any such symmetries in our\npresent universe.

In this paper, we\ncall attention to a particular evolutionary aspect that in all probability is\nthe main cause of this conundrum. As soon as stellar populations intercept the\nages at which RGB stars first appear, a sudden change in the lifetime of the\ncore He-burning phase causes a temporary boost in the production rate of\nsubsequent evolutionary phases, including the TP-AGB. For a timespan of about\n0.1 Gyr, triple TP-AGB branches develop at slightly different initial masses,\ncausing their frequency and contribution to the integrated luminosity of the\nstellar population to increase by a factor of 2. The boost occurs just in the\nproximity of the expected peak in the TP-AGB lifetimes, and for ages of 1.6\nGyr. Coincidently, this relatively narrow age interval happens to contain the\nfew very massive MC clusters that host most of the TP-AGB stars used to\nconstrain stellar evolution and EPS models. This concomitance makes the\nAGB-boosting particularly insidious in the context of present EPS models. The\neffect brings about three main consequences. (1) Present estimates of the\nTP-AGB contribution to the integrated light of galaxies derived from MC\nclusters, are biased towards too large values. (2) The relative TP-AGB\ncontribution of single-burst populations falling in this critical age range\ncannot be accurately derived by the fuel consumption theorem. (3) A careful\nrevision of AGB star populations in intermediate-age MC clusters is urgently\ndemanded.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Aug 2013 08:28:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-25"}

There are\ntwo shocks when an ultra-relativistic fireball that has been ejected during the\nprompt gamma-ray emission phase sweeps up the circumburst medium: a reverse\nshock that propagates into the fireball, and a forward shock that propagates\ninto the ambient medium.

The topics which are studied include: model\ntheory from Hilbert module point of view, Hilbert modules of holomorphic\nfunctions, module tensor products, localizations, dilations, submodules and\nquotient modules, free resolutions, curvature and Fredholm Hilbert modules.\nMore developments in the study of Hilbert module approach to operator theory\ncan be found in a companion paper, \"Applications of Hilbert Module Approach to\nMultivariable Operator Theory\".\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Aug 2013 09:23:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 Dec 2013 06:29:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 27 Sep 2014 19:14:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-30"}

We obtained on-the-fly-maps in 13CO (2-1) and C18O\n(2-1) with a high spectral resolution of 0.1 km/s and a spatial resolution of\n12\". These maps cover an area of ~1.5 square degrees and include the two main\nclouds of W43, as well as the lower density gas surrounding them. A comparison\nwith Galactic models and previous distance calculations confirms the location\nof W43 near the tangential point of the Scutum arm at a distance from the Sun\nof approximately 6 kpc. The resulting intensity cubes of the observed region\nare separated into sub-cubes, centered on single clouds which are then analyzed\nin detail. The optical depth, excitation temperature, and H2 column density\nmaps are derived out of the 13CO and C18O data. These results are then compared\nwith those derived from Herschel dust maps.

In\npractice, control fields are a source of unavoidable noise, which has to be\nsuppressed to retain controllability. Can one design control fields such that\nthe effect of noise is negligible on the time-scale of the transformation? This\nquestion is intimately related to the fundamental problem of a connection\nbetween the computational complexity of the control problem and the sensitivity\nof the controlled system to noise. The present study considers a paradigm of\ncontrol, where the Lie-algebraic structure of the control Hamiltonian is fixed,\nwhile the size of the system increases with the dimension of the Hilbert space\nrepresentation of the algebra. We find two types of control tasks, easy and\nhard. Easy tasks are characterized by a small variance of the evolving state\nwith respect to the operators of the control operators. They are relatively\nimmune to noise and the control field is easy to find. Hard tasks have a large\nvariance, are sensitive to noise and the control field is hard to find. The\ninfluence of noise increases with the size of the system, which is measured by\nthe scaling factor $N$ of the largest weight of the representation. For fixed\ntime and control field as O(N) for easy tasks and as $O(N^2)$ for hard tasks.\nAs a consequence, even in the most favorable estimate, for large quantum\nsystems, generic noise in the controls dominates for a typical class of target\ntransformations, i.e., complete controllability is destroyed by noise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Aug 2013 11:02:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

Determining if a graph is Hamiltonian is known as a NP-complete\nproblem and no satisfactory characterization for these graphs has been found.\n  In 1976 Bondy and Chvatal introduced a way to get round the Hamiltonicity\nproblem complexity by using a closure of the graph. This closure is a\nsupergraph of G which preserves Hamiltonicity, that is, which is Hamiltonian if\nand only if G is. Since this seminal work, several closure concepts preserving\nHamiltonicity were introduced. In particular Ryjacek defined in 1997 a closure\nconcept for claw-free graphs based on local completion. The completion is\nperformed for every eligible vertex of the graph.\n  Extending these works, Vallee and Bretto recently introduced a new closure\nconcept preserving Hamiltonicity and based on local completion. The local\ncompletion is performed for each neighborhood-equivalence eligible vertex of\nthe graph.\n  In this article, we generalize the main results of Vallee and Bretto by\nintroducing a broader notion of neighborhood equivalence eligibility, allowing\nthe definition of a denser graph closure which still preserves Hamiltonicity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Aug 2013 12:22:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-29"}

The UV-optical spectral\nenergy distribution of star formation dominated galaxies is the result of\nseveral different factors. These include the joint distribution of stellar\nmasses, ages, and metallicities, and the subsequent reprocessing by dust and\ngas in the ISM. Using a large cosmological hydrodynamical simulation we\ninvestigate the predicted spectral energy distributions of galaxies at\nhigh-redshift with a particular emphasis on assessing the potential\ncontribution of nebular emission. We find that the average pure stellar\nUV-optical colour correlates with both luminosity and redshift such that\ngalaxies at lower-redshift and higher-luminosity are typically redder. Assuming\nthe escape fraction of ionising photons is close to zero, the effect of nebular\nemission is to redden the UV-optical 1500-V_w colour by, on average, 0.4 mag at\nz=8 declining to 0.25 mag at z=4. Young and low-metallicity stellar\npopulations, which typically have bluer pure stellar UV-optical colours,\nproduce larger ionising luminosities and are thus more strongly affected by the\nreddening effects of nebular emission. This causes the distribution of 1500-V_w\ncolours to narrow and the trends with luminosity and redshift to weaken. The\nstrong effect of nebular emission leaves observed-frame colours critically\nsensitive to the source redshift. For example, increasing the redshift by 0.1\ncan result in observed frame colours changing by up to ~0.6. These predictions\nreinforce the need to include nebular emission when modelling the spectral\nenergy distributions of galaxies at high-redshift and also highlight the\ndifficultly in interpreting the observed colours of individual galaxies without\nprecise redshifts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Aug 2013 12:53:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

Our motivation for introducing this algorithm is that the already\nexisting methods like MF-DXA have at best serious limitations for most of the\nsignals describing complex natural processes and often indicate multifractal\ncross-correlations when there are none. The principal component of the present\nextension is proper incorporation of the sign of fluctuations to their\ngeneralized moments. Furthermore, we present a broad analysis of the model\nfractal stochastic processes as well as of the real-world signals and show that\nMFCCA is a robust and selective tool at the same time, and therefore allows for\na reliable quantification of the cross-correlative structure of analyzed\nprocesses. In particular, it allows one to identify the boundaries of the\nmultifractal scaling and to analyze a relation between the generalized Hurst\nexponent and the multifractal scaling parameter $\\lambda_q$. This relation\nprovides information about character of potential multifractality in\ncross-correlations and thus enables a deeper insight into dynamics of the\nanalyzed processes than allowed by any other related method available so far.\nBy using examples of time series from stock market, we show that financial\nfluctuations typically cross-correlate multifractally only for relatively large\nfluctuations, whereas small fluctuations remain mutually independent even at\nmaximum of such cross-correlations.

The theory developed is\napplicable to a wide class of 2+1 noncanonical Hamiltonian matter models, but\nthe specific example of the Vlasov-Poisson system linearized about homogeneous\n(spatially independent) equilibria is treated in detail. For this example,\nstructural (in)stability is established in an appropriate functional analytic\nsetting, and two kinds of bifurcations are considered, one at infinite and one\nat finite wavenumber. After defining and describing the notion of dynamical\naccessibility, Kre\\u{i}n-like theorems regarding signature and bifurcation are\nproven. In addition, a canonical Hamiltonian example, composed of a negative\nenergy oscillator coupled to a heat bath, is treated and our development is\ncompared to pervious work in this context. A careful counting of eigenvalues,\nwith and without symmetry, is undertaken, leading to the definition of a\ndegenerate continuum steady state (CSS) bifurcation.

In\ncontinuous domains, maximum likelihood is usually used to assess the\npredictions of those classifiers. When data is scarce, this can easily lead to\noverfitting. In any probabilistic setting, Bayesian averaging (BA) provides\ntheoretically optimal predictions and is known to be robust to overfitting. In\nthis work we introduce Bayesian Conditional Gaussian Network Classifiers, which\nefficiently perform exact Bayesian averaging over the parameters. We evaluate\nthe proposed classifiers against the maximum likelihood alternatives proposed\nso far over standard UCI datasets, concluding that performing BA improves the\nquality of the assessed probabilities (conditional log likelihood) whilst\nmaintaining the error rate.\n  Overfitting is more likely to occur in domains where the number of data items\nis small and the number of variables is large. These two conditions are met in\nthe realm of bioinformatics, where the early diagnosis of cancer from mass\nspectra is a relevant task. We provide an application of our classification\nframework to that problem, comparing it with the standard maximum likelihood\nalternative, where the improvement of quality in the assessed probabilities is\nconfirmed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Aug 2013 15:14:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-29"}

The angle $\\delta$ between these two\norientations can be interpreted as a magnetic field alignment deviation,\nassuming the emission gradient orientation to coincide with the density\ngradient orientation in the magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) force equation. In SMA\nhigh-resolution (collapsing) cores, additional symmetry properties in $\\delta$\ncan reveal accretion and outflow zones.
