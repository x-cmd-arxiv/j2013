Furthermore, these transmission coefficients are\nalso found to be controlled independently by a suitable combination of two gate\nvoltages applied across the junction. This result holds for an arbitrary\nprofile of the tunneling amplitudes, including disorder in the tunnel region,\nenabling us to discuss the effect of the finite length of the tunnel junction,\nand the space modulation of both magnitude and phase of the tunneling\namplitudes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Aug 2013 19:31:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Jan 2014 12:51:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-22"}

Observations of the 2006 December 13 event reveal two shocks\nfollowing each other, whose excitation scenario contradicts the delayed\nCME-driven bow-shock hypothesis.

These results open up a possibility to\nutilize the superconducting chiral domain wall motion for future novel\nsuperconducting devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Aug 2013 04:32:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-13"}

For information transmission,\nwe consider two types of multiple access schemes, namely, time division\nmultiple access (TDMA) and orthogonal frequency division multiple access\n(OFDMA). At the receiver side, due to the practical limitation that circuits\nfor harvesting energy from radio signals are not yet able to decode the carried\ninformation directly, each user applies either time switching (TS) or power\nsplitting (PS) to coordinate the energy harvesting (EH) and information\ndecoding (ID) processes. For the TDMA-based information transmission, we employ\nTS at the receivers; for the OFDMA-based information transmission, we employ PS\nat the receivers. Under the above two scenarios, we address the problem of\nmaximizing the weighted sum-rate over all users by varying the time/frequency\npower allocation and either TS or PS ratio, subject to a minimum harvested\nenergy constraint on each user as well as a peak and/or total transmission\npower constraint. For the TS scheme, by an appropriate variable transformation\nthe problem is reformulated as a convex problem, for which the optimal power\nallocation and TS ratio are obtained by the Lagrange duality method. For the PS\nscheme, we propose an iterative algorithm to optimize the power allocation,\nsubcarrier (SC) allocation and the PS ratio for each user. The performances of\nthe two schemes are compared numerically as well as analytically for the\nspecial case of single-user setup. It is revealed that the peak power\nconstraint imposed on each OFDM SC as well as the number of users in the system\nplay a key role in the rate-energy performance comparison by the two proposed\nschemes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Aug 2013 05:13:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Feb 2014 09:33:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-14"}

We find that the plasma temperature in the current\nsheet region increases with time and it becomes greater than that in the inflow\nregion. As secondary magnetic islands appear, the highest temperature is not\nalways found at the reconnection $X$-points, but also inside the secondary\nislands. One of the effects of anisotropic thermal conduction is to decrease\nthe temperature of the reconnecting $X-$points and transfer the heat into the\n$O-$points, the plasmoids, where it gets trapped. In the cases with\ntemperature-dependent magnetic diffusivity, $\\eta \\sim T^{-3/2}$, the decrease\nin plasma temperature at the $X-$points leads to: (i) increase in the magnetic\ndiffusivity until the characteristic time for magnetic diffusion becomes\ncomparable to that of thermal conduction; (ii) increase in the reconnection\nrate; and, (iii) more efficient conversion of magnetic energy into thermal\nenergy and kinetic energy of bulk motions. These results provide further\nexplanation of the rapid release of magnetic energy into heat and kinetic\nenergy seen during flares and coronal mass ejections.

It is particularly important for\nmulti-scale problems where the required number of floating-point operations can\nbe reduced by orders of magnitude relative to more traditional static mesh\napproaches.\n  Increasingly, finite element and finite volume codes are being optimised for\nmodern multi-core architectures. Typically, decomposition methods implemented\nthrough the Message Passing Interface (MPI) are applied for inter-node\nparallelisation, while a threaded programming model, such as OpenMP, is used\nfor intra-node parallelisation. Inter-node parallelism for mesh adaptivity has\nbeen successfully implemented by a number of groups. However, thread-level\nparallelism is significantly more challenging because the underlying data\nstructures are extensively modified during mesh adaptation and a greater degree\nof parallelism must be realised.\n  In this paper we describe a new thread-parallel algorithm for anisotropic\nmesh adaptation algorithms. For each of the mesh optimisation phases\n(refinement, coarsening, swapping and smoothing) we describe how independent\nsets of tasks are defined.

Recently, Majorana's\nspirit returns in modern condensed matter physics -- in the context of\ntopological Majorana zero modes in certain classes of topological\nsuperconductors(TSCs). In this paper, we attempt to investigate the topological\nnature of the neutrino by assuming that a relativistic Majorana fermion can be\ndivided into four topological Majorana zero modes at cutoff energy scale, e.g.\nplanck scale. We begin with an exactly solvable $1$D lattice model which\nrealizes a $T^2=-1$ time reversal symmetry protected TSC, and show that a pair\nof topological Majorana zero modes can realize a $T^4=-1$ time reversal\nsymmetry.Moreover, we find that a pair of topological Majorana zero modes can\nalso realize a $P^4=-1$ parity symmetry and even a nontrivial $\\overline\nC^4=-1$ charge conjugation symmetry. Next, we argue that the origin of three\ngenerations of neutrinos(charged leptons and quarks) can be naturally explained\nas three distinguishable ways of forming a pair of complex fermions(with\nopposite spin polarizations) out of four topological Majorana zero modes,\ncharacterized by the $T^4=-1$, $(TP)^4=-1$ and $(T \\overline C)^4=-1$\nfractionalized symmetries that each complex fermion carries at cutoff energy\nscale.

We first show that SCGs are altruism-independently smooth,\ni.e., the robust price of anarchy of these games remains the same under\narbitrary altruistic extensions. We then devise a general reduction technique\nthat enables us to reduce the problem of establishing smoothness for an\naltruistic extension of a base game to a corresponding SCG. Our reduction\napplies whenever the base game relates to a canonical SCG by satisfying a\nsimple social contribution boundedness property. As it turns out, several\nwell-known games satisfy this property and are thus amenable to our reduction\ntechnique.

This article is the second part of a research work whose\nfirst part was devoted to the regime of normal dispersion, and was presented in\nref. \\cite{Part_I}. The case of anomalous dispersion is indeed the most\ninteresting from the theoretical point of view, because of the considerable\nvariety of dynamical behaviors that can be observed. From a technological point\nof view, it is also the most relevant because it corresponds to the regime\nwhere Kerr combs are predominantly generated, studied, and used for different\napplications. In this article, we analyze the connection between the spatial\npatterns and the bifurcation structure of the eigenvalues associated to the\nvarious equilibria of the system. The bifurcation map evidences a considerable\nrichness from a dynamical standpoint. We study in detail the emergence of\nsuper- and sub-critical Turing patterns in the system. We determine the areas\nwere bright isolated cavity solitons emerge, and we show that soliton molecules\ncan emerge as well. Very complex temporal patterns can actually be observed in\nthe system, where solitons (or soliton complexes) co-exist with or without\nmutual interactions. Our investigations also unveil the mechanism leading to\nthe phenomenon of breathing solitons. Two routes to chaos in the system are\nidentified, namely a route via the so called secondary combs, and another via\nsoliton breathers. The Kerr combs corresponding to all these temporal patterns\nare analyzed in detail, and a discussion is led about the possibility to gain\nsynthetic comprehension of the observed spectra out of the dynamical complexity\nof the system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Aug 2013 12:25:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-13"}

In this paper we investigate if it is\npossible to improve the accuracy using the cross-correlation.\n  We use a simple parametrization of the Lyman-alpha forest survey which very\nloosely matches some properties of BOSS and predicts delta D_V/D_V = 2.0 % for\nthe auto-correlation at z=2.5. For the redshifted 21-cm observations we\nconsider individual antennas of size 2 m * 2 m distributed such that the\nbaselines within 250 m are uniformly sampled. It is assumed that the\nobservations span z=2 to 3 and covers the 10,000 deg^2 sky coverage of BOSS. We\nfind that for 2 years of observation with an array of 2,000 antennas, the\ncross-correlation is 1.7 times more sensitive than the Lyman-alpha forest\nauto-correlation. The cross-correlation is 2.7 times more sensitive than the\nauto-correlation if we have 4,000 antennas and 4 years of observation. In\nconclusion, we find that it is possible to significantly increase the accuracy\nof the distance estimates by considering the cross-correlation signal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Aug 2013 13:21:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-13"}

The\ncoefficients of the M theory interactions are determined by the strongly\ncoupled type IIA theory. Given the nature of the dilaton dependence, it is\nplausible that for low values of n, the coefficient has a similar structure as\nthe genus (n+1) string amplitude of the type IIA D^{6n} R^4 interaction, namely\nthe transcendental nature. Assuming this, and focussing on the even--even spin\nstructure part of the type IIA string amplitude, this coefficient is given by\nthe type IIB genus (n+1) amplitude, which we constrain using supersymmetry,\nS--duality and maximal supergravity. The source terms of the Poisson equations\nsatisfied by the S--duality invariant IIB couplings play a central role in the\nanalysis.

Observation of synchrotron radiation in the radio band\nconfirms there is a relativistic electron population in CWBs. Accordingly, CWBs\nhave been suspected sources of high-energy gamma-ray emission since the COS-B\nera. Theoretical models exist that characterize the underlying physical\nprocesses leading to particle acceleration and quantitatively predict the\nnon-thermal energy emission observable at Earth. Aims: We strive to find\nevidence of gamma-ray emission from a sample of seven CWB systems: WR 11, WR\n70, WR 125, WR 137, WR 140, WR 146, and WR 147. Theoretical modelling\nidentified these systems as the most favourable candidates for emitting\ngamma-rays. We make a comparison with existing gamma-ray flux predictions and\ninvestigate possible constraints. Methods: We used 24 months of data from the\nLarge Area Telescope (LAT) on-board the Fermi Gamma Ray Space Telescope to\nperform a dedicated likelihood analysis of CWBs in the LAT energy range.\nResults: We find no evidence of gamma-ray emission from any of the studied CWB\nsystems and determine corresponding flux upper limits. For some CWBs the\ninterplay of orbital and stellar parameters renders the Fermi-LAT data not\nsensitive enough to constrain the parameter space of the emission models. In\nthe cases of WR140 and WR147, the Fermi-LAT upper limits appear to rule out\nsome model predictions entirely and constrain theoretical models over a\nsignificant parameter space.

Several response\nstrategies are discussed, including a glance on how time preferences change\nprevious results. Furthermore, a possibility of retaliation is presented: when\nmaximin scores exceed the minimum symmetric payoff, it is possible to extort\nthe extortioner.\n  Finally, a summary of findings from evolutionary game theory shows that\nmischief is limited by its own malice. Nevertheless, this does not challenge\nthe result that mindless economic maximization is subject to extortion: the\nstudy of ZD strategies reveals exciting new perspectives and opportunities in\ngame theory, both evolutionary and classic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Aug 2013 14:24:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-13"}

This problem arises in the analysis of both weighted and\nunweighted networks. The term density is often used in this context, in order\nto refer to the mean edge weight of a weighted network, or to the number of\nedges in an unweighted one. Comparing families of networks is therefore\nstatistically difficult because differences in topology are necessarily\nassociated with differences in density. In this review paper, we consider this\nproblem from two different perspectives, which include (i) the construction of\nsummary networks, such as how to compute and visualize the mean network from a\nsample of network-valued data points; and (ii) how to test for topological\ndifferences, when two families of networks also exhibit significant differences\nin density. In the first instance, we show that the issue of summarizing a\nfamily of networks can be conducted by adopting a mass-univariate approach,\nwhich produces a statistical parametric network (SPN). In the second part of\nthis review, we then highlight the inherent problems associated with the\ncomparison of topological functions of families of networks that differ in\ndensity. In particular, we show that a wide range of topological summaries,\nsuch as global efficiency and network modularity are highly sensitive to\ndifferences in density. Moreover, these problems are not restricted to\nunweighted metrics, as we demonstrate that the same issues remain present when\nconsidering the weighted versions of these metrics. We conclude by encouraging\ncaution, when reporting such statistical comparisons, and by emphasizing the\nimportance of constructing summary networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Aug 2013 14:26:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 Mar 2014 06:09:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-28"}

Zones of convergent migration exist where the Type I torque cancels out.\nWe study the evolution of multiple protoplanets of a few Earth masses embedded\nin a non-isothermal protoplanetary disc. The protoplanets are located in the\nvicinity of a convergence zone located at the transition between two different\nopacity regimes. Inside the convergence zone, Type I migration is directed\noutward and outside the zone migration is directed inward. We used a grid-based\nhydrodynamical code that includes radiative effects. We performed simulations\nvarying the initial number of embryos and tested the effect of including\nstochastic forces to mimic the effects resulting from turbulence. We also\nperformed N-body runs calibrated on hydrodynamical calculations to follow the\nevolution on Myr timescales. For a small number of initial embryos (N = 5-7)\nand in the absence of stochastic forcing, the population of protoplanets\nmigrates convergently toward the zero-torque radius and forms a stable resonant\nchain that protects embryos from close encounters. In systems with a larger\ninitial number of embryos, or in which stochastic forces were included, these\nresonant configurations are disrupted. This in turn leads to the growth of\nlarger cores via a phase of giant impacts, after which the system settles to a\nnew stable resonant configuration. Giant planets cores with masses of 10 Earth\nmasses formed in about half of the simulations with initial protoplanet masses\nof m_p = 3 Earth masses but in only 15% of simulations with m_p = 1 Earth mass.\nThis suggests that if ~2-3 Earth mass protoplanets can form in less than ~1\nMyr, convergent migration and giant collisions can grow giant planet cores at\nType I migration convergence zones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Aug 2013 15:43:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

The resulting bounds\non weak-sector Lorentz violation are at the 10^(-4) level, a substantial\nimprovement over previous results. The highly relativistic character of the\npions involved is responsible for the improvement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Aug 2013 15:52:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-13"}

We show the existence of a transition\nregion between milling and schooling, in which the school exhibits\nmultistability and intermittency between schooling and milling for the same\ncombination of individuals parameters. We also show that milling does not occur\nfor arbitrarily large groups, mainly due to a distance dependence interaction\nof the model and information propagation delays in the school, which cause\nconflicting reactions for large groups. We finally discuss the biological\nsignificance of our findings, especially the dependence of behavioural\ntransitions on social interactions, which were reported by Gautrais etal to be\nadaptive in the experimental conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Aug 2013 15:27:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-03"}

We consider a single-cell IEEE 802.16 environment\nin which the base station allocates subchannels to the subscriber stations in\nits coverage area. The subchannels allocated to a subscriber station are shared\nby multiple connections at that subscriber station. To ensure the Quality of\nService (QoS) performances, a Connection Admission Control (CAC) scheme is\nconsidered at a subscriber station. A queueing analytical framework for these\nadmission control schemes is presented considering OFDMA-based transmission at\nthe physical layer. Then, based on the queueing model, both the\nconnection-level and the packet-level performances are studied and compared\nwith their analogues in the case without CAC. The connection arrival is modeled\nby a Poisson process and the packet arrival for a connection by a two-state\nMarkov Modulated Poisson Process (MMPP). We determine analytically and\nnumerically different performance parameters, such as connection blocking\nprobability, average number of ongoing connections, average queue length,\npacket dropping probability, queue throughput and average packet delay.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Aug 2013 15:16:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-15"}
