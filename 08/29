To address the challenges of\nsampling high-dimensional pdfs arising from Bayesian inverse problems governed\nby PDEs, we build on the stochastic Newton MCMC method.

The comparison of the three methods is conducted on a synthetic ice\nsheet inverse problem. For this problem, the stochastic Newton MCMC method with\na MAP-based Hessian converges at least as rapidly as the original stochastic\nNewton MCMC method, but is far cheaper since it avoids recomputing the Hessian\nat each step. On the other hand, it is more expensive per sample than the\nindependence sampler; however, its convergence is significantly more rapid, and\nthus overall it is much cheaper.

To address this\nquestion, we evaluate the k-mer distribution of the human reference genome. The\nk-mer frequency is determined for k ranging from 20 to 1000 basepairs. We use\nthe proportion of non-singleton k-mers to evaluate the mappability of reads for\na corresponding read length.

However, the two commonly used measures\nof genetic association, the odds-ratio (OR) and p-value, may rank variants in\ndifferent order. To integrate these two measures into a single analysis, here\nwe transfer the volcano plot methodology from gene expression analysis to\ngenetic association studies. In its original setting, volcano plots are scatter\nplots of fold-change and t-test statistic (or -log of the p-value), with the\nlatter being more sensitive to sample size. In genetic association studies, the\nOR and Pearson's chi-square statistic (or equivalently its square root, chi; or\nthe standardized log(OR)) can be analogously used in a volcano plot, allowing\nfor their visual inspection. Moreover, the geometric interpretation of these\nplots leads to an intuitive method for filtering results by a combination of\nboth OR and chi-square statistic, which we term \"regularized-chi\". This method\nselects associated markers by a smooth curve in the volcano plot instead of the\nright-angled lines which corresponds to independent cutoffs for OR and\nchi-square statistic. The regularized-chi incorporates relatively more signals\nfrom variants with lower minor-allele-frequencies than chi-square test\nstatistic.

When\nexternalities are present, not only can a player's marginal contribution - a\ncentral notion to the Shapley value - be defined in a variety of ways, but it\nis also not obvious which axiomatization should be used. Consequently, a number\nof authors extended the Shapley value using complex and often unintuitive\naxiomatizations. Furthermore, no algorithm to approximate any extension of the\nShapley value to partition-function games has been proposed to date. Given this\nbackground, we prove in this paper that, for any well-defined measure of\nmarginal contribution, Shapley's original four axioms imply a unique value for\ngames with externalities. As an consequence of this general theorem, we show\nthat values proposed by Macho-Stadler et al., McQuillin and Bolger can be\nderived from Shapley's axioms. Building upon our analysis of marginal\ncontribution, we develop a general algorithm to approximate extensions of the\nShapley value to games with externalities using a Monte Carlo simulation\ntechnique.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Aug 2013 19:16:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-29"}

This is a\ncentral notion in signal processing, statistics and machine learning. But in\napplications such as sparse coding, edge detection, compression and super\nresolution, the dictionary $A$ is unknown and has to be learned from random\nexamples of the form $Y = AX$ where $X$ is drawn from an appropriate\ndistribution --- this is the dictionary learning problem. In most settings, $A$\nis overcomplete: it has more columns than rows. This paper presents a\npolynomial-time algorithm for learning overcomplete dictionaries; the only\npreviously known algorithm with provable guarantees is the recent work of\nSpielman, Wang and Wright who gave an algorithm for the full-rank case, which\nis rarely the case in applications. Our algorithm applies to incoherent\ndictionaries which have been a central object of study since they were\nintroduced in seminal work of Donoho and Huo.

The origin of this annoying feature\nis explained and it is shown how it can be theoretically removed, leading to\nmacroscopic quantizations (quantized Dirac monopoles, integral quantum Hall\neffect, quantized magnetoelectric phenomena in topological insulators). Apart\nhowever from serving as a theoretical probe of macroscopic quantizations, there\nare cases (experimental conditions, clarified here) when this \"gauge\nnonlocality\" does not really suffer from any ambiguity: an apparently innocent\ngauge transformation corresponds to real change in physics of a companion\nsystem in higher dimensionality, that leads to physical momentum transfers to\nour own system. This nonlocality, together with the associated \"proximity\" or\nremote effects are then real and lead to the remarkable possibility of inducing\ntopological phenomena from outside our system (which always remains field-free\nand can even reside in simply-connected space).

While the corresponding parameter\ncombinations do not yet have to be unnaturally small, the constraints are\nlikely to preclude large effects in other CP-violating observables.\nNevertheless, the generically expected contributions to electric dipole moments\nin this class of models lie within the projected sensitivity of the\nnext-generation experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Aug 2013 20:00:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 9 Mar 2014 00:27:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

The filaments are not in equilibrium at any time, but instead are\nlong-lived flow features, through which the gas flows from the cloud to the\nclumps. The filaments are long-lived because they accrete from their\nenvironment while simultaneously accreting onto the clumps within them; they\nare essentially the locus where the flow changes from accreting in two\ndimensions to accreting in one dimension. Moreover, the clumps also exhibit a\nhierarchical nature: the gas in a filament flows onto a main, central clump,\nbut other, smaller-scale clumps form along the infalling gas.

They also do not explicitly\nlist word pairs that are not opposites but yet have some degree of contrast in\nmeaning, such as {\\rm warm} and {\\rm cold} or {\\rm tropical} and {\\rm\nfreezing}. We propose an automatic method to identify contrasting word pairs\nthat is based on the hypothesis that if a pair of words, $A$ and $B$, are\ncontrasting, then there is a pair of opposites, $C$ and $D$, such that $A$ and\n$C$ are strongly related and $B$ and $D$ are strongly related. (For example,\nthere exists the pair of opposites {\\rm hot} and {\\rm cold} such that {\\rm\ntropical} is related to {\\rm hot,} and {\\rm freezing} is related to {\\rm\ncold}.) We will call this the contrast hypothesis. We begin with a large\ncrowdsourcing experiment to determine the amount of human agreement on the\nconcept of oppositeness and its different kinds. In the process, we flesh out\nkey features of different kinds of opposites. We then present an automatic and\nempirical measure of lexical contrast that relies on the contrast hypothesis,\ncorpus statistics, and the structure of a {\\it Roget}-like thesaurus. We show\nthat the proposed measure of lexical contrast obtains high precision and large\ncoverage, outperforming existing methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Aug 2013 20:24:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-30"}

We have\nexplored various models for the dust opacity, assuming different constant dust\ntemperatures, as well as a varying dust temperature model. We find that while\nstrong radiative feedback appears as a viable mechanism to regulate the stellar\nmass fraction in massive galaxies, it also prevents the formation of discs with\nreasonable morphologies. In models with strong stellar radiation feedback,\nstellar discs are systematically too thick while the gas disc morphology is\ncompletely destroyed due to the efficient mixing between the feedback-affected\ngas and its surroundings. At the resolution of our simulation suite, we find it\nimpossible to preserve spiral disc morphology while at the same time expelling\nenough baryons to satisfy the abundance matching constraints.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Aug 2013 21:47:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 16 Mar 2014 16:45:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 1 Sep 2014 22:31:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

This fraction is expected to fall-off towards high redshift as\nthe intergalactic medium becomes significantly neutral, and the galaxies'\nLy-alpha emission is progressively attenuated. Intriguingly, early measurements\nwith this technique suggest a strong drop in the Ly-alpha fraction near z ~ 7.\nPrevious work concluded that this requires a surprisingly neutral intergalactic\nmedium -- with neutral hydrogen filling more than 50 % of the volume of the\nUniverse -- at this redshift. We model the evolving Ly-alpha fraction using\ncosmological simulations of the reionization process. Before reionization\ncompletes, the simulated Ly-alpha fraction has large spatial fluctuations owing\nto the inhomogeneity of reionization. Since existing measurements of the\nLy-alpha fraction span relatively small regions on the sky, and sample these\nregions only sparsely, they may by chance probe mostly galaxies with above\naverage Ly-alpha attenuation. We find that this sample variance is not\nexceedingly large for existing surveys, but that it does somewhat mitigate the\nrequired neutral fraction at z ~ 7. Quantitatively, in a fiducial model\ncalibrated to match measurements after reionization, we find that current z = 7\nobservations require a volume-averaged neutral fraction of x_HI > 0.05 at 95 %\nconfidence level.

These recent developments have\nmade it clear that the Milky Way is a complex and dynamical structure, one that\nis still being shaped by the merging of neighboring smaller galaxies. We also\nbriefly discuss the next generation of wide-field sky surveys, such as\nSkyMapper, Pan-STARRS, Gaia and LSST, which will improve measurement precision\nmanyfold, and comprise billions of individual stars.

The accuracy of the constructed ephemerides was\nverified by comparison with observations and JPL independent ephemerides DE424.\n  The EPM ephemerides are used in astronavigation (they form the basis of the\n{\\it Astronomical Yearbook} and are planned to be utilized in GLONASS and\nLUNA-RESURS programs) and various research, including the estimation of the\nsolar oblateness, the parameters of the rotation of Mars, and the total mass of\nthe asteroid main belt and TNOs, as well as the verification of general\nrelativity, the secular variations of the Sun's mass and the gravitational\nconstant, and the limits on the dark matter density in the Solar System.\n  The EPM ephemerides, together with the corresponding time differences TT -\nTDB and the coordinates of seven additional objects (Ceres, Pallas, Vesta,\nEris, Haumea, Makemake, and Sedna), are available at\nftp://quasar.ipa.nw.ru/incoming/EPM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Aug 2013 10:12:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-30"}

Further, unlike a\nmicroscopic lattice with large-N limit and nearly zero relative spacing, the\npolariton in the quasi-lattice has uneven decay rate over the relative spacing.\nWe show that this unevenness coincides with the cooperative emission effect\nexpected from the superradiance model, where alternative excitations in the\nqubits of the lattice result in maximum decay.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Aug 2013 11:21:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Sep 2013 09:24:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 3 Apr 2014 01:37:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-23"}

They provide statistically\nsignificant samples of massive stars of uniform ages. To accurately determine\nthe intrinsic physical properties of these stars we need to establish the\ndistances, ages and reddening of the clusters. One avenue to achieve this is\nthe identification and characterisation of the main sequence members of red\nsupergiant rich clusters.\n  Here we utilise publicly available data from the UKIDSS galactic plane\nsurvey. We show that point spread function photometry in conjunction with\nstandard photometric decontamination techniques allows us to identify the most\nlikely main sequence members in the 10-20Myr old clusters RSGC1, 2, and 3. We\nconfirm the previous detection of the main sequence in RSGC2 and provide the\nfirst main sequence detection in RSGC1 and RSGC3. There are in excess of 100\nstars with more than 8Msun identified in each cluster. These main sequence\nmembers are concentrated towards the spectroscopically confirmed red supergiant\nstars. We utilise the J-K colours of the bright main sequence stars to\ndetermine the K-band extinction towards the clusters. The differential\nreddening is three times as large in the youngest cluster RSGC1 compared to the\ntwo older clusters RSGC2 and RSGC3. Spectroscopic follow up of the cluster main\nsequence stars should lead to more precise distance and age estimates for these\nclusters as well as the determination of the stellar mass function in these\nhigh mass environments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Aug 2013 11:32:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

Based on a number of numerical examples, we found that such a\ntransmission technique can outperform alternative solutions. In fact, when an\neavesdropper (Eve) has a worse channel than the authorized user (Bob), the\nsecurity gap required to reach a given level of security is very small. The\namount of degradation of Eve's channel with respect to Bob's that is needed to\nachieve sufficient security can be further reduced by implementing scrambling\nand descrambling operations on blocks of frames, rather than on single frames.\nWhile Eve's channel has a quality equal to or better than that of Bob's\nchannel, we have shown that the use of a hybrid automatic repeat-request (HARQ)\nprotocol with authentication still allows achieving a sufficient level of\nsecurity. Finally, the secrecy performance of some practical schemes has also\nbeen measured in terms of the equivocation rate about the message at the\neavesdropper and compared with that of ideal codes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Aug 2013 11:39:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-30"}

Multilayer structures\ncomprising thin metal films with adjustable adhesion were fabricated. The\nCu/Ag/Ti/Si structures were grown on Si substrates and include thin Ti and Ag\nfilms and a thick Cu layer. The Ag and Ti films were deposited on the Si\nsubstrate under vacuum, and a thick Cu layer was subsequently electroplated\nonto the Ag surface. Later, the sandwich was separated and a vacuum nanogap was\nopened to produce two Ag/Cu and Ti/Si conformal electrodes. The adhesion\nstrength between the Ti and Ag films was precisely adjusted by exposing the\nstructures to dry O2 after Ti growth but before Ag growth. The resulting\nadhesion needed to be sufficiently high to allow electroplating of Cu and\nsufficiently low to allow subsequent separation. Either heating or cooling was\nused to separate the sandwiches. T he structures separated as a result of the\ndifferent thermal expansion parameters of the Si and Cu electrodes and the low\nadhesion between the Ti and Ag layers. After separation, the Ag and Ti surfaces\nwere analyzed optically using a Michelson interferometer. Adhesion regulation\nand optimization of the electroplating regime allowed fabrication of two\nconformal electrodes with a nanogap smaller than 5 nm and an area larger than 7\nmm2. Such electrodes can be used for efficient energy conversion and cooling in\nthe mixed thermionic and thermotunneling regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Aug 2013 13:08:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

These detection levels are nonetheless important\nfor the data analysis. We argue that to prove the simultaneous existence of all\n$n$ components revealed in a multi-periodic variation, it is mandatory to apply\nat least $2^n-1$ significance tests, among which the most involves various\nmulti-frequency statistics, and only $n$ tests are single-frequency ones.\n  The main result of the paper is an analytic estimation of the statistical\nsignificance of the frequency tuples that the multi-frequency periodogram can\nreveal.

This suggests a\nfundamental proportionality between accretion rates and mass reservoir,\nsuggesting identical collapse timescales for all masses. We conclude that if\nthe pre-collapse evolution is quasi-static, the fragmentation scale (which is\nsimilar for all masses) would limit the size of the initial mass reservoirs,\nleading to shorter free-fall times for higher mass stars. However, as we find\nidentical collapse timescales for all masses, a significant turbulent/magnetic\nsupport is needed to slow down the collapse of the more massive envelopes in a\nquasi-static view. With this support still to be discovered, and with\nindications of large dynamics in pre-collapse gas for high-mass star formation,\nwe propose that such an identical collapse timescale implies that the initial\ndensities, which should set the duration of the collapse, should be similar for\nall masses. This suggests that the mass that incorporates massive stars has to\nhave been accreted in a dynamical way from larger scales than those of low-mass\nstars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Aug 2013 15:05:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

These surveys necessitate the determination of the galaxy\nredshifts using photometric techniques (photo-z). Oftentimes, it is\nadvantageous to remove from the galaxy sample those for which one suspects that\nthe photo-z estimation might be unreliable. In this paper, we show that\napplying these photo-z quality cuts blindly can grossly bias the measured\ngalaxy correlations within and across photometric redshift bins. We then extend\nthe work of Ho et al. (2012) and Ross et al. (2011) to develop a simple and\neffective method to correct for this using the data themselves. Finally, we\napply the method to the Mega-Z catalog, containing about a million luminous red\ngalaxies in the redshift range 0.45 < z < 0.65. After splitting the sample into\nfour \\Delta z = 0.05 photo-z bins using the BPZ algorithm, we see how our\ncorrections bring the measured galaxy auto- and cross-correlations into\nagreement with expectations. We then look for the BAO feature in the four bins,\nwith and without applying the photo-z quality cuts, and find a broad agreement\nbetween the BAO scales extracted in both cases. Intriguingly, we observe a\ncorrelation between galaxy density and photo-z quality even before any photo-z\nquality cuts are applied. This may be due to uncorrected observational effects\nthat result in correlated gradients across the sky of the galaxy density and\nthe galaxy photo-z precision. Our correction procedure could also help to\nmitigate some of these systematic effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Aug 2013 15:52:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Nov 2013 14:32:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-06"}

Our aim is for it to be generic enough so as to be applied to any\nastrophysical cases where we expect dynamics and collisions to be deeply\ninterlocked with one another: planets in discs, violent massive breakups,\ndestabilized planetesimal belts, exozodiacal discs, etc. The code takes its\nbasic architecture from the LIDT3D algorithm developed by Charnoz et al.(2012)\nfor protoplanetary discs, but has been strongly modified and updated in order\nto handle the very constraining specificities of debris discs physics:\nhigh-velocity fragmenting collisions, radiation-pressure affected orbits,\nabsence of gas, etc. In LIDT-DD, grains of a given size at a given location in\na disc are grouped into \"super-particles\", whose orbits are evolved with an\nN-body code and whose mutual collisions are individually tracked and treated\nusing a particle-in-a-box prescription. To cope with the wide range of possible\ndynamics, tracers are sorted and regrouped into dynamical families depending on\ntheir orbits. The code retrieves the classical features known for debris discs,\nsuch as the particle size distributions in unperturbed discs, the outer radial\ndensity profiles (slope in -1.5) outside narrow collisionally active rings, and\nthe depletion of small grains in \"dynamically cold\" discs. The potential of the\nnew code is illustrated with the test case of the violent breakup of a massive\nplanetesimal within a debris disc.

This is just one of the approaches found in literature to the\ndescription of transformations where the role of conjugation has been\nmisunderstood. In this paper, the different approaches are examined in\nparticular in respect to the role of conjugation. In order to justify and\ncorrectly derive the congruential rule for polarization basis transformation\nand properly place the role of conjugation, the origin of the problem is traced\nback to the derivation of the antenna hight from the transmitted field. In\nfact, careful consideration of the role played by the Green's dyadic operator\nrelating the antenna height to the transmitted field shows that, under general\nunitary basis transformation, it is not justified to assume a scalar\nrelationship between them. Invariance of the voltage equation shows that\nantenna states and wave states must in fact lie in dual spaces, a distinction\nnot captured in conventional Jones vector formalism. Introducing spinor\nformalism, and with the use of an alternate spin frame for the transmitted\nfield a mathematically consistent implementation of the directional wave\nformalism is obtained.
