Silicon atoms are\nthe main diffusing species in this transformation, migrating from the Si\nsubstrate through the growing NiSi layer into the Ni2Si. Pt atoms have a low\nsolubility in Ni2Si and prefer Si-sites in the NiSi lattice, thereby\nstabilizing the NiSi phase. The diffusivity of Pt is lower than that of Ni.\nFurthermore, Pt atoms have a tendency to segregate to interfaces, thereby\nacting as diffusion barriers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Aug 2013 16:00:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-13"}

In the\ncarbon wall case, a runaway electron plateau is observed, while in the\nITER-like wall case, the current quench is slower and the runaway current is\nnegligibly small. The aim of the paper is to shed light on the reason for these\ndifferences by detailed numerical modelling to study which factors affected the\nRE formation. The post-disruption current profile is calculated by a\none-dimensional model of electric field, temperature and runaway current taking\ninto account the impurity injection. Scans of various impurity contents are\nperformed and agreement with the experimental scenarios is obtained for\nreasonable argon- and wall impurity contents. Our modelling shows that the\nreason for the changed RE dynamics is a complex, combined effect of the\ndifferences in plasma parameter profiles, the radiation characteristics of\nberyllium and carbon, and the difference of the injected argon amount. These\ntogether lead to a significantly higher Dreicer generation rate in the carbon\nwall case, which is less prone to be suppressed by RE loss mechanisms. The\nresults indicate that the differences are greatly reduced above ~50% argon\ncontent, suggesting that significant RE current is expected in future massive\ngas injection experiments on both JET and ITER.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Aug 2013 16:37:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

The last in our series is the tight hardness of approximating the\nk-hypergraph pricing problem, a fundamental problem arising from the area of\nalgorithmic game theory.

Inside the\nporous medium, phase transition points are shifted, or may disappear\naltogether. A crucial determinant is how the walls interact with the fluid\nparticles. In this work, we consider the situation whereby the walls are\nneutral with respect to the liquid and vapor phase. In order to realize the\ncondition of strict neutrality, we use a symmetric binary mixture inside a\nporous medium that interacts identically with both of the mixture species.\nMonte Carlo simulations are then used to obtain the phase behavior. Our main\nfinding is that, in the presence of the porous medium, a liquid-vapor type\ntransition still occurs, but with critical exponents that deviate from bulk\nIsing values. In addition, we observe clear violations of self-averaging. These\nfindings provide further evidence that random confinement by neutral walls\ninduces critical behavior of the random Ising model (i.e. Ising models with\ndilution type disorder, where the disorder couples to the energy).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Aug 2013 17:09:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

The\nmost striking features include the increase of horizontal field at the polarity\ninversion line (PIL) and the co-spatial penumbral darkening. A likely\nexplanation of the above phenomenon is the back reaction to the coronal\nrestructuring after eruptions: a coronal mass ejection carries the upward\nmomentum while the downward momentum compresses the field lines near the PIL.\nPrevious studies could only use low resolution (above 1\") magnetograms and\nwhite-light images. Therefore, the changes are mostly observed for X-class\nflares. Taking advantage of the 0.1\" spatial resolution and 15s temporal\ncadence of the New Solar Telescope at Big Bear Solar Observatory, we report in\ndetail the rapid formation of sunspot penumbra at the PIL associated with the\nC7.4 flare on 2012 July 2. It is unambiguously shown that the solar granulation\npattern evolves to alternating dark and bright fibril structure, the typical\npattern of penumbra. Interestingly, the appearance of such a penumbra creates a\nnew delta sunspot. The penumbral formation is also accompanied by the\nenhancement of horizontal field observed using vector magnetograms from the\nHelioseismic and Magnetic Imager. We explain our observations as due to the\neruption of a flux rope following magnetic cancellation at the PIL.\nSubsequently the re-closed arcade fields are pushed down towards the surface to\nform the new penumbra.

At any time the selector can see the graph\ninduced by the vertices that have already come. The selector's aim is to choose\nonline the maximal vertex (i.e. the vertex with no outgoing edges). It is shown\nthat the probability of success $p_n$ for the optimal algorithm for the $k$th\npower of a directed path satisfies $p_n = \\Theta(n^{-1/(k+1)})$. We also\nconsider the case when the selector knows the distance in the underlying path\nbetween each two vertices that are joined by an edge in the induced graph.

Conversely, when SDSS galaxies are split\nbased on their color, we find that the correlation function of blue optical\ngalaxies is practically indistinguishable from that of HI-selected galaxies. At\nthe same time, SDSS galaxies with red colors are found to cluster significantly\nmore than HI-selected galaxies, a fact that is evident in both the projected as\nwell as the full two-dimensional correlation function. A cross-correlation\nanalysis further reveals that gas-rich galaxies \"avoid\" being located within ~3\nMpc of optical galaxies with red colors. Next, we consider the clustering\nproperties of halo samples selected from the Bolshoi LambdaCDM simulation. A\ncomparison with the clustering of ALFALFA galaxies suggests that galactic HI\nmass is not tightly related to host halo mass, and that a sizable fraction of\nsubhalos do not host HI galaxies. Lastly, we find that we can recover fairly\nwell the correlation function of HI galaxies by just excluding halos with low\nspin parameter. This finding lends support to the hypothesis that halo spin\nplays a key role in determining the gas content of galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Aug 2013 19:45:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

In each case, the pertinent operators that are generated are\nparametrically enhanced relative to other interactions that arise at loop level\nin the Standard Model such as h -> gg and h -> gamma gamma. Thus we emphasize\nthat the effects of interest here provide a unique possibility to probe the\ndynamics underlying electroweak symmetry breaking, and do not depend on any\ncontrivance stemming from carefully chosen spectra. The effects we discuss\nnaturally lead to concerns of compatibility with precision electroweak\nmeasurements, and we show with relevant computations that these corrections can\nbe kept well under control in our general parameter space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Aug 2013 20:00:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Oct 2013 15:08:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-13"}

The dipolar degrees of freedom are added to the ionic ones and\nresult in a generalization of the Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) equation called the\nDipolar PB (DPB). By looking at the DPB equation around a fixed point-like ion,\na closed-form formula for the dielectric constant is obtained. We express the\ndielectric constant using the \"hydration length\" that characterizes the\nhydration shell of dipoles around ions, and thus the strength of the dielectric\ndecrement. The DPB equation is then examined for three additional cases:\nmixture of solvents, polarizable medium and ions of finite size.

This result can be viewed as a continuation\nof our recent work (ICALP 2012) in which we presented the first\nsub-logarithmic-round distributed O(1)-approximation algorithm for metric\nfacility location on a \\textit{clique} network. The bipartite setting presents\nseveral new challenges not present in the problem on a clique network. We\npresent two new techniques to overcome these challenges. (i) In order to deal\nwith the problem of not being able to choose appropriate probabilities (due to\nlack of adequate knowledge), we design an algorithm that performs a random walk\nover a probability space and analyze the progress our algorithm makes as the\nrandom walk proceeds. (ii) In order to deal with a problem of quickly\ndisseminating a collection of messages, possibly containing many duplicates,\nover the bipartite network, we design a probabilistic hashing scheme that\ndelivers all of the messages in expected-$O(\\log \\log n)$ rounds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Aug 2013 20:45:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-14"}

In this scenario the MWA can be\nconsidered the receiving element in a bi-static radar configuration, with FM\nbroadcast stations serving as non-cooperative transmitters. The FM broadcasts\npropagate into space, are reflected off debris in Earth orbit, and are received\nat the MWA. The imaging capabilities of the MWA can be used to simultaneously\ndetect multiple pieces of space debris, image their positions on the sky as a\nfunction of time, and provide tracking data that can be used to determine\norbital parameters.

Optimal training sounds\nthe channel using orthogonal beamforming vectors to find an estimate that\noptimizes some cost function, such as mean square error. As the number of\ntransmit antennas increases, however, the training overhead becomes\nsignificant. This creates a need for alternative channel estimation schemes for\nincreasingly large transmit arrays. In this work, we relax the orthogonal\nrestriction on sounding vectors. The use of a feedback channel after each\nforward channel use during training enables closed-loop sounding vector design.\nA misalignment cost function is introduced, which provides a metric to\nsequentially design sounding vectors. In turn, the structure of the sounding\nvectors aligns the transmit beamformer with the true channel direction, thereby\nincreasing beamforming gain. This beam alignment scheme for massive MIMO is\nshown to improve beamforming gain over conventional orthogonal training for a\nMISO channel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Aug 2013 04:03:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 2 Apr 2014 22:01:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-04"}

The statistical properties of this walk are not known\nin detail, and here, we study memory and bias, as well as directional\ncorrelations between successive runs in bidirectional transport. We show, based\non a study of the direction reversal probabilities of the cargo using a purely\nstochastic (tug-of-war) model, that bidirectional motion of cellular cargoes\nis, in general, a correlated random walk. In particular, while the motion of a\ncargo driven by two oppositely pulling motors is a Markovian random walk,\nmemory of direction appears when multiple motors haul the cargo in one or both\ndirections. In the latter case, the Markovian nature of the underlying single\nmotor processes is hidden by internal transitions between degenerate run and\npause states of the cargo. Interestingly, memory is found to be a non-monotonic\nfunction of the number of motors. Stochastic numerical simulations of the\ntug-of-war model support our mathematical results and extend them to\nbiologically relevant situations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Aug 2013 04:29:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 14 Aug 2013 11:38:40 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 19 Sep 2013 04:21:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

Starting from a magnetized primordial\nprestellar cloud, we calculate the cloud evolution several hundreds of years\nafter first protostar formation, resolving the protostellar radius. When the\nnatal minihalo field strength is weaker than B \\lesssim 10^-13 (n/1 cm^-3)^-2/3\nG (n is the hydrogen number density), magnetic effects can be ignored. In this\ncase, fragmentation occurs frequently and a stellar cluster forms, in which\nstellar mergers and mass exchange between protostars contribute to the mass\ngrowth of these protostars. During the early gas accretion phase, the most\nmassive protostar remains near the cloud centre, whereas some of the less\nmassive protostars are ejected. The magnetic field significantly affects\nPopulation III star formation when B_amb \\gtrsim 10^-12 (n/1 cm^-3)^-2/3 G. In\nthis case, because the angular momentum around the protostar is effectively\ntransferred by both magnetic braking and protostellar jets, the gas falls\ndirectly onto the protostar without forming a disk, and only a single massive\nstar forms. In addition, a massive binary stellar system appears when B_amb\n\\sim 10^-12 (n/1cm^-3)^-2/3 G. Therefore, the magnetic field determines the end\nresult of the formation process (cluster, binary or single star) for Population\nIII stars. Moreover, no persistent circumstellar disk appears around the\nprotostar regardless of the magnetic field strength, which may influence the\nfurther evolution of Population III stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Aug 2013 04:53:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

To appreciate the anomalies further, we investigated\nthe prominence eruptions and disappearances observed with the Nobeyama\nRadioheliograph during over 20 years. Consequently, we found that the\noccurrence of the prominence activities in the northern hemisphere is normal\nbecause the period of the number variation is 11 years and the migration of the\nproducing region of the prominence activities traces the migration of 11 years\nago. On the other hand, the migration in the southern hemisphere significantly\ndiffers from that in the northern hemisphere and the previous cycles. The\nprominence activities occurred over -50 degrees latitude in spite of the late\ndecay phase of Cycle 23, and the number of the prominence activities in the\nhigher latitude region (over -65 degrees) is very small even near the solar\nmaximum of Cycle 24. The results suggest that the anomalies of the global\nmagnetic field distribution started at the solar maximum of Cycle 23.\nComparison of the butterfly diagram of the prominence activities with the\nmagnetic butterfly diagram indicates that the timing of \"the rush to the pole\"\nand the polar magnetic field closely relates to the unusual migration.\nConsidering that the rush to the pole is made of the sunspots, the hemispheric\nasymmetry of the sunspots and the strength of the polar magnetic fields are\nessential for understanding the anomalies of the prominence activities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Aug 2013 08:10:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

Noninformative priors depend on the relationship of the\ndata to the parameters over the sample space. Combining Bayesian updating -\nmultiplying an existing posterior density for parameters being estimated by a\nlikelihood function derived from independent new data that depend on those\nparameters and renormalizing - with use of noninformative priors gives rise to\ninconsistency where existing and new data depend on continuous parameters in\ndifferent ways. In such cases, noninformative priors for inference from only\nthe existing and from only the new data would differ, so Bayesian updating\nwould give different final posterior densities depending on which set of data\nwas used to derive an initial posterior and which was used to update that\nposterior. I propose a revised Bayesian updating method, which resolves this\ninconsistency by updating the prior as well as the likelihood function, and\ninvolves only a single application of Bayes' theorem. The revised method is\nalso applicable where actual prior information as to parameter values exists\nand inference that objectively reflects the existing information as well as new\ndata is sought.

The aim is to understand how the\nscale function should be used for estimation of the univariate component. It is\nknown that the scale function does not affect the rate of the MISE convergence,\nand as a result sharp constants are explored. The paper begins with developing\na sharp-minimax theory for a pivotal model\n$Y=f(X)+\\sigma(X,\\mathbf{Z})\\varepsilon$, where $\\varepsilon$ is standard\nnormal and independent of the predictor X and the auxiliary vector-covariate\n$\\mathbf{Z}$. It is shown that if the scale $\\sigma(x,\\mathbf{z})$ depends on\nthe auxiliary variable, then a special estimator, which uses the scale (or its\nestimate), is asymptotically sharp minimax and adaptive to unknown smoothness\nof f(x). This is an interesting conclusion because if the scale does not depend\non the auxiliary covariate $\\mathbf{Z}$, then ignoring the heteroscedasticity\ncan yield a sharp minimax estimation. The pivotal model serves as a natural\nbenchmark for a general additive model\n$Y=f(X)+g(\\mathbf{Z})+\\sigma(X,\\mathbf{Z})\\varepsilon$, where $\\varepsilon$ may\ndepend on $(X,\\mathbf{Z})$ and have only a finite fourth moment. It is shown\nthat for this model a data-driven estimator can perform as well as for the\nbenchmark. Furthermore, the estimator, suggested for continuous responses, can\nbe also used for the case of discrete responses. Bernoulli and Poisson\nregressions, that are inherently heteroscedastic, are particular considered\nexamples for which sharp minimax lower bounds are obtained as well. A numerical\nstudy shows that the asymptotic theory sheds light on small samples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Aug 2013 10:07:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-14"}

Meaningful\nconnection between these two emissions can be drawn only by an accurate\ndescription of the prompt MeV spectrum. We perform a time-resolved spectroscopy\nof the GBM data of long GRBs having significant GeV emission, using a model\nconsisting of 2 blackbodies and a power-law.

This\nwork is based primarily upon the author's D.Phil. thesis. We first consider\nfour-dimensional, maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory as a gauge theory\nin twistor space. We focus on the perturbation theory associated to this\naction, which in an axial gauge leads to the MHV formalism. This allows us to\nefficiently compute scattering amplitudes at tree-level (and beyond) in twistor\nspace. Other gauge theory observables such as local operators and null\npolygonal Wilson loops can also be formulated twistorially, leading to proofs\nfor several correspondences between correlation functions and Wilson loops, as\nwell as a recursive formula for computing mixed Wilson loop / local operator\ncorrelators. We then apply the twistor action approach to general relativity,\nusing the on-shell equivalence between conformal and Einstein gravity. This can\nbe extended to N=4 supersymmetry. The perturbation theory of the twistor action\nleads to formulae for the MHV amplitude with and without cosmological constant,\nyields a candidate for the Einstein twistor action, and induces a MHV formalism\non twistor space.

Some of\nthis transport is associated with the random walk of magnetic flux tubes\nsubject to granular and supergranular buffeting, some of it is due to the\nadvection caused by systematic cross-equatorial flows such as those associated\nwith the inflows into active regions, and some crosses the equator during the\nemergence process.\n  We aim to determine how much of the cross-equatorial transport is due to\nsmall-scale disorganized motions (treated as diffusion) compared with other\nprocesses such as emergence flux across the equator. We measure the\ncross-equatorial flux transport using Kitt Peak synoptic magnetograms,\nestimating both the total and diffusive fluxes. Occasionally a large sunspot\ngroup, with a large tilt angle emerges crossing the equator, with flux from the\ntwo polarities in opposite hemispheres. The largest of these events carry a\nsubstantial amount of flux across the equator (compared to the magnetic flux\nnear the poles). We call such events cross-equatorial flux plumes. There are\nvery few such large events during a cycle, which introduces an uncertainty into\nthe determination of the amount of magnetic flux transported across the equator\nin any particular cycle. As the amount of flux which crosses the equator\ndetermines the amount of net flux in each hemisphere, it follows that the\ncross-equatorial plumes introduce an uncertainty in the prediction of the net\nflux in each hemisphere. This leads to an uncertainty in predictions of the\nstrength of the following cycle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Aug 2013 11:45:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

The design problem is to maximize the system throughput (i.e.,\nthe weighted sum rate) subject to individual energy harvesting constraints and\npower constraints. Different from the conventional IFCs without energy\nharvesting, the cross-link signals in the considered scenario play two opposite\nroles in information detection (ID) and energy harvesting (EH). It is observed\nthat the ideal scheme, where the receivers can simultaneously perform ID and EH\nfrom the received signal, may not always achieve the best tradeoff between\ninformation transfer and energy harvesting, but simple practical schemes based\non time splitting may perform better. We therefore propose two practical time\nsplitting schemes, namely time division mode switching (TDMS) and time division\nmultiple access (TDMA), in addition to a power splitting (PS) scheme which\nseparates the received signal into two parts for ID and EH, respectively. In\nthe two-user scenario, we show that beamforming is optimal to all the schemes.\nMoreover, the design problems associated with the TDMS and TDMA schemes admit\nsemi-analytical solutions. In the general K-user scenario, a successive convex\napproximation method is proposed to handle the WIET problems associated with\nthe ideal scheme and the PS scheme, which are known to be NP-hard in general.\nThe K-user TDMS and TDMA schemes are shown efficiently solvable as convex\nproblems. Simulation results show that stronger cross-link channel powers\nactually improve the information sum rate under energy harvesting constraints.\nMoreover, none of the schemes under consideration can dominate another in terms\nof the sum rate performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Aug 2013 12:32:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

This start-up method, used\nin the Mega-Ampere Spherical Tokamak (MAST), is studied as a high Lundquist\nnumber and low plasma-beta magnetic reconnection experiment.\n  In this paper, 2D fluid simulations are presented of this merging process in\norder to understand the underlying physics, and better interpret the\nexperimental data. These simulations examine the individual and combined\neffects of tight-aspect ratio geometry and two-fluid physics on the merging.\nThe ideal self-driven flux-rope dynamics are coupled to the diffusion layer\nphysics, resulting in a large range of phenomena. For resistive MHD\nsimulations, the flux-ropes enter the sloshing regime for normalised\nresistivity eta < 1E-5. In Hall-MHD three regimes are found for the qualitative\nbehaviour of the current sheet, depending on the ratio of the current sheet\nwidth to the ion-sound radius. These are a stable collisional regime, an open\nX-point regime, and an intermediate regime that is highly unstable to\ntearing-type instabilities.\n  In toroidal axisymmetric geometry, the final state after merging is a\nMAST-like spherical tokamak with nested flux-surfaces. It is also shown that\nthe evolution of simulated 1D radial density profiles closely resembles the\nThomson scattering electron density measurements in MAST. An intuitive\nexplanation for the origin of the measured density structures is proposed,\nbased upon the results of the toroidal Hall-MHD simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Aug 2013 13:18:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-04"}

Global convergence (i.e., convergence to a stationary point\nfrom any initial solution) as well as local convergence rate follows from the\nstandard theory for optimization on manifold directly. A major computational\nadvantage is that the computation of linear eigenvalue problems is no longer\nneeded. The main costs of our approaches arise from the assembling of the total\nenergy functional and its gradient and the projection onto the manifold. These\ntasks are cheaper than eigenvalue computation and they are often more suitable\nfor parallelization as long as the evaluation of the total energy functional\nand its gradient is efficient.

Using an approximation of\nthe laser field as a Gaussian beam, working within the Rayleigh-Gans regime and\nassuming isotropic surface energy at the oil-water interface, we numerically\nsolve the resulting shape equations to elucidate the three-dimensional droplet\ngeometry. We obtain a plethora of shapes as a function of the number of optical\ntweezers, their laser powers and positions, surface tension, initial droplet\nsize and geometry. Experimentally, two-dimensional droplet silhouettes have\nbeen imaged from above, but their full side-on view has not been observed and\nreported for current optical configurations. This experimental limitation\npoints to ambiguity in differentiating between droplets having the same\ntwo-dimensional projection but with disparate three-dimensional shapes.
