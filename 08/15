As for ordinary spectral sequences we will see differentials\nand group extensions, however the real power comes from the appearance of\nnatural isomorphims between pages of differing indices.\n  The constructions reveal finer invariants than ordinary spectral sequences,\nand they connect to other fields such as Fary functors and perverse sheaves.\nThey are based on a natural index scheme, which allows us to obtain new results\neven in the standard case of Z-filtered chain complexes, e.g. a useful\ncriterion for a product structure for Grothendieck's spectral sequences, and\nnews paths to connect the first or second page to the limit.\n  This turns out to yield the right framework for unifying several spectral\nsequences that one would usually apply one after another. Examples that we work\nout are successive Leray--Serre spectral sequences, the Adams--Novikov spectral\nsequence following the chromatic spectral sequence, successive Grothendieck\nspectral sequences, and successive Eilenberg--Moore spectral sequences.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Aug 2013 17:35:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 Mar 2022 13:41:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-21"}

In particular, we show the\nexistence (and abundance) of several hitherto unknown families of simplices in\nquaternionic projective spaces and the octonionic projective plane. The most\nnoteworthy cases are 15-point simplices in HP^2 and 27-point simplices in OP^2,\nboth of which are the largest simplices and the smallest 2-designs possible in\ntheir respective spaces. These codes are all universally optimal, by a theorem\nof Cohn and Kumar. We also show the existence of several positive-dimensional\nfamilies of simplices in the Grassmannians of subspaces of R^n with n <= 8;\nclose numerical approximations to these families had been found by Conway,\nHardin, and Sloane, but no proof of existence was known. Our existence proofs\nare computer-assisted, and the main tool is a variant of the Newton-Kantorovich\ntheorem. This effective implicit function theorem shows, in favorable\nconditions, that every approximate solution to a set of polynomial equations\nhas a nearby exact solution. Finally, we also exhibit a few explicit codes,\nincluding a configuration of 39 points in OP^2 that form a maximal system of\nmutually unbiased bases. This is the last tight code in OP^2 whose existence\nhad been previously conjectured but not resolved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Aug 2013 17:37:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 Sep 2013 16:01:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 6 Dec 2013 16:06:03 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 23 Sep 2015 04:16:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-20"}

Afterglows produced by the interaction of a relativistic\noutflow with a wind-like medium peak when the blast-wave deceleration sets in,\nand the afterglow spectrum could be hardening before that peak, as the optical\nthickness to pair-formation is decreasing. In contrast, in afterglows produced\nin the interaction with a homogeneous medium, the optical thickness to\npair-formation should increase and yield a light-curve peak when it reaches\nunity, followed by a fast light-curve decay, accompanied by a spectral\nsoftening. If energy is injected in the blast-wave, then the accelerated\nincrease of the optical thickness yields a convex afterglow light-curve. Other\nfeatures, such as a double-peak light-curve or a broad hump, can arise from the\nevolution of the optical thickness to photon-photon absorption. Fast decays and\nconvex light-curves are seen in a few LAT afterglows, but the expected spectral\nsoftening is rarely seen in (and difficult to measure with) LAT observations.\nFurthermore, for the effects of photon-photon attenuation to shape the\nhigh-energy afterglow light-curve without attenuating it too much, the ejecta\ninitial Lorentz factor must be in a relatively narrow range (50-200), which\nreduces the chance of observing those effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Aug 2013 18:16:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Apr 2014 16:22:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

Our system consists of a Fermi sea of spinless fermions\ninteracting with an impurity atom of different species which is confined by an\nisotropic potential. The interspecies attraction can be tuned with an $s$-wave\nFeshbach resonance so that the impurity atom and a spinless fermion form a\nbound dimer that occupies a threefold-degenerate $p$ orbital of the confinement\npotential. Many-body scatterings of this dimer and surrounding spinless\nfermions occur with exchanging their angular momenta and thus exhibit the SU(3)\norbital Kondo effect. The associated Kondo temperature has a universal leading\nexponent given by $T_K\\propto\\exp[-\\pi/(3a_p k_F^3)]$ that depends only on an\neffective $p$-wave scattering volume $a_p$ and a Fermi wave vector $k_F$.

The formation process of massive stars\nis poorly constrained because of their scarcity, the short formation timescale\nand obscuration. By obtaining a census of the newly formed stellar population,\nthe star formation history of the young cluster and the role of the massive\nstars within it can be unraveled. We aim to reconstruct the formation history\nof the young stellar population of the massive star-forming region RCW 36. We\nstudy several dozens of individual objects, both photometrically and\nspectroscopically, look for signs of multiple generations of young stars and\ninvestigate the role of the massive stars in this process. We obtain a census\nof the physical parameters and evolutionary status of the young stellar\npopulation. Using a combination of near-infrared photometry and spectroscopy we\nestimate ages and masses of individual objects. We identify the population of\nembedded young stellar objects (YSO) by their infrared colors and emission line\nspectra. RCW 36 harbors a stellar population of massive and intermediate-mass\nstars located around the center of the cluster. Class 0/I and II sources are\nfound throughout the cluster. The central population has a median age of 1.1\n+/- 0.6 Myr. Of the stars which could be classified, the most massive ones are\nsituated in the center of the cluster. The central cluster is surrounded by\nfilamentary cloud structures; within these, some embedded and accreting YSOs\nare found. Our age determination is consistent with the filamentary structures\nhaving been shaped by the ionizing radiation and stellar winds of the central\nmassive stars. The formation of a new generation of stars is ongoing, as\ndemonstrated by the presence of embedded protostellar clumps, and two exposed\njets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Aug 2013 20:00:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

Given the PL relations\nthat provide accurate distances and the large number of spectral lines,\nCepheids are excellent tracers of the present-day abundance gradients.

In this paper we focus on the inner and outer regions of the\nGalactic thin disk. Methods: We use HR spectra (FEROS, ESPADONS, NARVAL) to\nmeasure the abundances of several light (Na, Al), alpha (Mg, Si, S, Ca), and\nheavy elements (Y, Zr, La, Ce, Nd, Eu) in a sample of 65 Milky Way Cepheids.\nCombining these results with accurate distances from period-Wesenheit relations\nin the NIR enables us to determine the abundance gradients in the Milky Way.\nResults: Our results are in good agreement with previous studies on either\nCepheids or other tracers.

We present the first such model in the\nfrequency domain, \"PhenomP\", which captures the basic phenomenology of the\nseven-dimensional parameter space of binary configurations with only three key\nphysical parameters. Two of these (the binary's mass ratio and an effective\ntotal spin parallel to the orbital angular momentum, which determines the\ninspiral rate) define an underlying non-precessing-binary model. The\nnon-precessing-binary waveforms are then \"twisted up\" with approximate\nexpressions for the precessional motion, which require only one additional\nphysical parameter, an effective precession spin, $\\chi_p$.

The model is constructed in the frequency\ndomain, which will be essential for efficient GW searches and source\nmeasurements.

As a part of the characterization, a new transmission method\ncalled space-time interference alignment is proposed, which exploits both the\ncurrent and past CSI jointly. Using the proposed alignment technique, an inner\nbound of the sum-DoF region is characterized as a function of a normalized CSI\nfeedback frequency, which measures CSI feedback speed compared to the speed of\nuser's channel variations. One consequence of the result is that the achievable\nsum-DoF gain is improved significantly when a user sends back both current and\noutdated CSI compared to the case where the user sends back current CSI only.\nThen, a trade-off between CSI feedback delay and the sum-DoF gain is\ncharacterized for the multi-user vector broadcast channel in terms of a\nnormalized CSI feedback delay that measures CSI obsoleteness compared to\nchannel coherence time. A crucial insight is that it is possible to achieve the\noptimal DoF gain if the feedback delay is less than a derived fraction of the\nchannel coherence time. This precisely characterizes the intuition that a small\ndelay should be negligible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Aug 2013 22:49:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-16"}

These models require solving an elliptic sub-problem at each time\nstep, which takes the bulk of the computational time. The method we propose\nhere is a modular approach that facilitates data transfer with simple\ninterpolations and uses black-box solvers for solving the elliptic sub-problem\nand potential vorticity equations in the QG flow solvers. After solving the\nelliptic sub-problem on a coarsened grid, an interpolation scheme is used to\nobtain the fine data for subsequent time stepping on the full grid. The\npotential vorticity field is then updated on the fine grid with savings in\ncomputational time due to the reduced number of grid points for the elliptic\nsolver. The method is applied to both single layer barotropic and two-layer\nstratified QG ocean models for mid-latitude oceanic basins in the beta plane,\nwhich are standard prototypes of more realistic ocean dynamics. The method is\nfound to accelerate these computations while retaining the same level of\naccuracy in the fine-resolution field. A linear acceleration rate is obtained\nfor all the cases we consider due to the efficient linear-cost fast Fourier\ntransform based elliptic solver used. We expect the speed-up of the CGP method\nto increase dramatically for versions of the method that use other, suboptimal,\nelliptic solvers, which are generally quadratic cost. It is also demonstrated\nthat numerical oscillations due to lower grid resolutions, in which the Munk\nscales are not resolved adequately, are effectively eliminated with CGP method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Aug 2013 02:23:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-08"}

In general, the innermost\ntemperature, T_in increases with the increase of i for a fixed value of mdot\nand a_ast, due to the Doppler effect. However, for i > 50 and mdot > mdot_turn,\nT_in starts to decrease with the increase of mdot. This is a result of\nself-obscuration -- the radiation from the innermost hot part of the disc is\nblocked by the surrounding cooler part. The value of mdot_turn and the\ncorresponding luminosities depend on a_ast and i. Such obscuration effects\ncause an interesting behavior on the disc luminosity (L_disc) -- T_in plane for\nhigh inclinations.

We analyze two z=0\ndata sets: a high-quality ~200-galaxy sample (the Nearby Field Galaxy Survey,\ndata release herein) and a volume-limited ~3000-galaxy sample with reprocessed\narchival data. Both reach down to baryonic masses ~10^9Msun and span\nvoid-to-cluster environments. Two mass-dependent transitions are evident: (i)\nbelow the \"gas-richness threshold\" scale (V~125km/s), gas-dominated\nquasi-bulgeless Sd--Im galaxies become numerically dominant, while (ii) above\nthe \"bimodality\" scale (V~200km/s), gas-starved E/S0s become the norm.\nNotwithstanding these transitions, galaxy mass (or V as its proxy) is a poor\npredictor of gas-to-stellar mass ratio M_gas/M_*. Instead, M_gas/M_* correlates\nwell with the ratio of a galaxy's stellar mass formed in the last Gyr to its\npreexisting stellar mass, such that the two ratios have numerically similar\nvalues. This striking correspondence between past-averaged star formation and\ncurrent gas richness implies routine refueling of star-forming galaxies on Gyr\ntimescales. We argue that this refueling underlies the tight M_gas/M_* vs.\ncolor correlations often used to measure \"photometric gas fractions.\"\nFurthermore, the threshold and bimodality scale transitions reflect\nmass-dependent demographic shifts between three refueling regimes --- accretion\ndominated, processing dominated, and quenched. In this picture, gas-dominated\ndwarfs are explained not by inefficient star formation but by overwhelming gas\naccretion, which fuels stellar mass doubling in <~1Gyr. Moreover, moderately\ngas-rich bulged disks such as the Milky Way are transitional, becoming abundant\nonly in the narrow range between the threshold and bimodality scales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Aug 2013 02:34:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

As a cheap upgrade one can consider an\ninstallation of a short helical (or cross-planar) afterburner, but then one\nshould have an efficient method to suppress powerful linearly polarized\nbackground from the main undulator. In this paper we propose a new method for\nsuch a suppression: an application of the reverse taper in the main undulator.\nWe discover that in a certain range of the taper strength, the density\nmodulation (bunching) at saturation is practically the same as in the case of\nnon-tapered undulator while the power of linearly polarized radiation is\nsuppressed by orders of magnitude. Then strongly modulated electron beam\nradiates at full power in the afterburner. Considering SASE3 undulator of the\nEuropean XFEL as a practical example, we demonstrate that soft X-ray radiation\npulses with peak power in excess of 100 GW and an ultimately high degree of\ncircular polarization can be produced. The proposed method is rather universal,\ni.e. it can be used at SASE FELs and seeded (self-seeded) FELs, with any\nwavelength of interest, in a wide range of electron beam parameters, and with\nany repetition rate. It can be used at different X-ray FEL facilities, in\nparticular at LCLS after installation of the helical afterburner in the near\nfuture.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Aug 2013 09:06:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

This study extends the\nclassical macrosegregation theory, highlights a significant technological\nbreakthrough to control CS, and could quickly yield practical benefits to the\nworldwide manufacture of over 50 million tons of ingots, super-thick slab and\nheavy castings annually, as well as has general implications for the\nelaboration of other related natural phenomena.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Aug 2013 09:14:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-16"}

The focus of these models have\ntypically been on large-scale analysis of scenarios such as cities, nations or\neven world scale. SIR models are appealing because of their simplicity, but\ntheir parameters, especially the transmission rate, are complex and depend on a\nnumber of factors, which makes it hard to predict how a change of a single\nenvironmental, demographic, or epidemiological factor will affect the\npopulation. Therefore, in this contribution we start to unpick the\ntransmission-rate parameter. Analysing the implications that arise when taking\ncrowd behaviour explicitly into account, we show how both the rate of infection\nas well as the walking speed depend on the local crowd density around an\ninfected individual. The combined effect is that the rate of infection at a\npopulation scale has an analytically tractable non-linear dependency on crowd\ndensity. We model the spread of a hypothetical disease in a corridor and\ncompare our new model with a typical compartmental model, which highlights the\nregime in which current models may not produce credible results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Aug 2013 11:11:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 21 Jul 2014 21:03:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-23"}

Here we analytically investigate this irregular dynamics in finite\nnetworks keeping track of all individual spike times and the identities of\nindividual neurons. For delayed, purely inhibitory interactions we show that\nthe irregular dynamics is not chaotic but in fact stable. Moreover, we\ndemonstrate that after long transients the dynamics converges towards periodic\norbits and that every generic periodic orbit of these dynamical systems is\nstable. We investigate the collective irregular dynamics upon increasing the\ntime scale of synaptic responses and upon iteratively replacing inhibitory by\nexcitatory interactions. Whereas for small and moderate time scales as well as\nfor few excitatory interactions, the dynamics stays stable, there is a smooth\ntransition to chaos if the synaptic response becomes sufficiently slow (even in\npurely inhibitory networks) or the number of excitatory interactions becomes\ntoo large. These results indicate that chaotic and stable dynamics are equally\ncapable of generating the irregular neuronal activity. More generally, chaos\napparently is not essential for generating high irregularity of balanced\nactivity, and we suggest that a mechanism different from chaos and\nstochasticity significantly contributes to irregular activity in cortical\ncircuits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Aug 2013 11:30:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-16"}

The\nother factor is an OU process driven by a pure jump L\\'evy process and models\nthe characteristic spikes observed in such markets. When it comes to pricing, a\npopular choice of pricing measure is given by the Esscher transform that\npreserves the probabilistic structure of the driving L\\'evy processes, while\nchanging the levels of mean reversion.

Stars were selected\nphotometrically and combined with the latest spectral types. 1145 candidate hot\nluminous stars were identified of which >700 were considered genuine early type\nstars that contribute to feedback. We assess the spectroscopic completeness to\nbe 85% in outer regions (>5pc) but fall to 35% in the vicinity of R136, giving\na total of 500 hot luminous stars with spectroscopy. Stellar calibrations and\nmodels were used to obtain their physical parameters before integrated values\nwere compared to global observations and the population synthesis code,\nStarburst99. The 31 W-R and Of/WN stars made large contributions to the total\nionising and wind luminosities of ~40% and ~50%, respectively. Stars with\nMinit>100Msun also showed high contributions to the global feedback, ~25% in\nboth cases. Such massive stars are not accounted for by the current Starburst99\ncode, which underestimated the ionising and wind luminosities of R136 by\nfactors of ~2 and ~9, respectively. The census inferred a SFR of\n0.073+/-0.04Msun/yr for 30 Dor, typically higher than results from popular SFR\ncalibrations. However, it remained consistent with a far-UV luminosity tracer\nand a combined Halpha and mid-infrared tracer, but only after correcting for\nHalpha extinction. The global ionising output exceeded measurements from the\nassociated gas and dust, suggesting ~6(+55/-6)% of ionising photons escape the\nregion. When studying very luminous star forming regions, it is therefore\nessential to include the most massive stars to ensure a reliable energy budget.\nIf 30 Dor is typical of other large star forming regions, estimates of the SFR\nwill be underpredicted if this escape fraction is not accounted for.(abridged)\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Aug 2013 14:33:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

I.e., can we \"back-propagate\"\nthrough these stochastic neurons? We examine this question, existing\napproaches, and compare four families of solutions, applicable in different\nsettings. One of them is the minimum variance unbiased gradient estimator for\nstochatic binary neurons (a special case of the REINFORCE algorithm). A second\napproach, introduced here, decomposes the operation of a binary stochastic\nneuron into a stochastic binary part and a smooth differentiable part, which\napproximates the expected effect of the pure stochatic binary neuron to first\norder. A third approach involves the injection of additive or multiplicative\nnoise in a computational graph that is otherwise differentiable. A fourth\napproach heuristically copies the gradient with respect to the stochastic\noutput directly as an estimator of the gradient with respect to the sigmoid\nargument (we call this the straight-through estimator).

The problem is then parameterized by\nthe sail lightness number, the ratio of solar radiation pressure acceleration\nto solar gravitational acceleration. Using boundary-value problem numerical\ncontinuation methods and the AUTO software package (Doedel et al. 1991) the\nfamilies can be fully mapped out as the parameter $\\beta$ is increased.\nInterestingly, the emergence of a branch point in the retrograde satellite\nfamily around the Earth at $\\beta\\approx0.0387$ acts to split the halo family\ninto two new families.

Modeling\nthe observed, linearly polarized strong resonance lines in the solar spectrum\noften requires the solution of the AD line transfer problems in one-dimensional\n(1D) or multi-dimensional (multi-D) geometries. The purpose of this paper is to\ndevelop an understanding of the relative importance of the AD PRD effects and\nthe multi-D transfer effects and particularly their combined influence on the\nline polarization. This would help in a quantitative analysis of the second\nsolar spectrum (the linearly polarized spectrum of the Sun). We consider both\nnon-magnetic and magnetic media. In this paper we reduce the Stokes vector\ntransfer equation to a simpler form using a Fourier decomposition technique for\nmulti-D media. A fast numerical method is also devised to solve the concerned\nmulti-D transfer problem. The numerical results are presented for a\ntwo-dimensional medium with a moderate optical thickness (effectively thin),\nand are computed for a collisionless frequency redistribution. We show that the\nAD PRD effects are significant, and can not be ignored in a quantitative fine\nanalysis of the line polarization. These effects are accentuated by the finite\ndimensionality of the medium (multi-D transfer). The presence of magnetic\nfields (Hanle effect) modifies the impact of these two effects to a\nconsiderable extent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Aug 2013 15:50:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-16"}

Despite this annoying setback,\nthese negative probabilities are what led the great Paul Dirac in 1928 to the\nesoteric discovery of the Dirac Equation. The Dirac Equation led to one of the\ngreatest advances in our understanding of the physical world. In this reading,\nwe ask the seemingly senseless question, \"Do negative probabilities exist in\nquantum mechanics?\" In an effort to answer this question, we arrive at the\nconclusion that depending on the choice one makes of the quantum probability\ncurrent, one will obtain negative probabilities. We thus propose a new quantum\nprobability current of the Klein-Gordon theory. This quantum probability\ncurrent leads directly to positive definite quantum probabilities. Because\nthese negative probabilities are in the bare Klein-Gordon theory, intrinsically\na result of negative energies, the fact that we here arrive at a theory with\npositive probabilities, means that negative energy particles are not to be\nconsidered problematic as is the case in the bare Klein-Gordon theory. From an\nabstract-objective stand-point; in comparison with positive energy particles,\nthe corollary is that negative energy particles should have equal chances to\nexist. As to why these negative energy particles do not exist, this is\nanalogous to asking why is it that Dirac's antimatter does not exist in equal\nproportions with matter. This problem of why negative energy particles do not\nexist in equal proportions with positive energy particles is a problem that\nneeds to be solved by a future theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Aug 2013 08:45:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-23"}
