The OS algorithm speeds up the ML estimation and\nachieves nearly the same level of accuracy of solutions as the one obtained by\nthe non-OS methods.

A recent work by Makarov (2012) has demonstrated that\ntrapping into this resonance is certain if the eccentricity is larger than 0.2,\nprovided that we use a realistic tidal model, the one which is based on the\nDarwin-Kaula expansion of the tidal torque. The physics-based tidal model\nchanges dramatically the statistics of the possible final spin states. First,\nwe discover that after only one encounter with the spin-orbit 3:2 resonance\nthis resonance becomes the most probable end-state. Second, if a capture into\nthis (or any other) resonance takes place, the capture becomes final, several\ncrossings of the same state being forbidden by our model. Third, within our\nmodel the trapping of Mercury happens much faster than previously believed: for\nmost histories, 10 - 20 Myr are sufficient. Fourth, even a weak laminar\nfriction between the solid mantle and a molten core would most likely result in\na capture in the 2:1 or even higher resonance. So the principal novelty of our\npaper is that the 3:2 end-state is more ancient than the same end-state\nobtained when the constant time lag model is employed. The swift capture\njustifies our treatment of Mercury as a homogeneous, unstratified body whose\nliquid core had not yet formed by the time of trapping. We also provide a\ncritical analysis of the hypothesis by Wieczorek et al. (2012) that the early\nMercury might had been retrograde, whereafter it synchronised its spin and then\naccelerated it to the 3:2 resonance. Accurate processing of the available data\non cratering does not support that hypothesis, while the employment of a\nrealistic rheology invalidates a key element of the hypothesis, an intermediate\npseudosynchronous state needed to spin-up to the 3:2 resonance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Jun 2013 18:04:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Jul 2013 18:01:03 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 18 Oct 2013 21:14:28 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 25 Apr 2014 03:51:03 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 4 Jun 2014 15:58:05 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Wed, 2 Jul 2014 13:51:47 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Sun, 24 Aug 2014 11:22:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-26"}

Compared with other magnification methods (e.g.,\ngeometric optics, mesh editing), 4D differential geometry theory and its\npractices are much more flexible and powerful for preserving shape features\n(i.e., minimizing angle distortion), and easier to adapt to versatile solid\nmodels. The primary advantage of 4D space lies at the following fact: we can\nnow easily magnify the volume of regions of interest (ROIs) from the additional\ndimension, while keeping the rest region unchanged. To achieve this primary\ngoal, we first embed a 3D volumetric input into 4D space and magnify ROIs in\nthe 4th dimension. Then we flatten the 4D shape back into 3D space to\naccommodate other typical applications in the real 3D world. In order to\nenforce distortion minimization, in both steps we devise the high dimensional\ngeometry techniques based on rigorous 4D geometry theory for 3D/4D mapping back\nand forth to amend the distortion.

This distribution function\nallows the system to possess appreciably low and insignificant thermal energy\nirrespective of the energy per particle. The spread in the energy among the\nparticles is attributed to the collisions in presence of the external force,\nwhereas; for equilibrium, the spreading in energy is due to the absence of the\nforce. The reactivity for a deuterium-deuterium fusion, using the proposed\ndistribution function, has been computed. It is shown that the fusion time is\ncomparable to the energy confinement time, collision time and transit time of\nthe ion for beam energy greater than 160 keV. The estimated energy gain Q\n(ratio of fusion power to the power consumed by the system) is around 10 for\nbeam energy 160 keV and ion density 1018 cm-3. The energy loss due to particle\nscattering is estimated and is taken into consideration in the estimation of\nenergy gain.

The topics are\nseparated into two parts. The first part describes the determination of\nconstants needed to interpret the digitized output of our electronics so that\nwe can obtain physical numbers such as photon counts and their arrival times\nfor each photomultiplier tube (PMT). In this context, we developed an in-situ\nprocedure to determine high-voltage settings for PMTs in large detectors like\nSK, as well as a new method for measuring PMT quantum efficiency and gain in\nsuch a detector. The second part describes the modeling of the detector in our\nMonte Carlo simulation, including in particular the optical properties of its\nwater target and their variability over time. Detailed studies on the water\nquality are also presented. As a result of this work, we achieved a precision\nsufficient for physics analysis over a wide energy range (from a few MeV to\nabove a TeV). For example, the charge determination was understood at the 1%\nlevel, and the timing resolution was 2.1 nsec at the one-photoelectron charge\nlevel and 0.5 nsec at the 100-photoelectron charge level.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Jun 2013 23:44:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 Dec 2013 13:37:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-23"}

However, it remains elusive whether both processes play a comparable\nrole or one of them prevails during a particular eruption. To shed light on\nthis issue, we carefully studied energetic but flareless CMEs, \\textit{i.e.},\nfast CMEs not accompanied by any flares. Through searching the Coordinated Data\nAnalysis Workshops (CDAW) database of CMEs observed in Solar Cycle 23, we found\n13 such events with speeds larger than 1000 km s$^{-1}$. Other common\nobservational features of these events are: (1) none of them originated in\nactive regions; they were associated with eruptions of well-developed long\nfilaments in quiet-Sun regions, (2) no apparent enhancement of flare emissions\nwas present in soft X-ray, EUV and microwave data. Further studies of two\nevents reveal that (1) the reconnection electric fields, as inferred from the\nproduct of the separation speed of post-eruption ribbons and the photospheric\nmagnetic field measurement, were in general weak; (2) the period with a\nmeasurable reconnection electric field is considerably shorter than the total\nfilament-CME acceleration time. These observations indicate that, for these\nfast CMEs, the magnetic energy was released mainly via the ideal flux rope\ninstability through the work done by the large scale Lorentz force acting on\nthe rope currents rather than via magnetic reconnections. We also suggest that\nreconnections play a less important role in accelerating CMEs in quiet Sun\nregions of weak magnetic field than those in active regions of strong magnetic\nfield.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Jun 2013 01:12:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

Mixture\nregression models have been applied to address such problems. By modeling the\nconditional distribution of the response given the covariate as a mixture, the\nsample can be clustered into groups and the individual regression models for\nthe groups can be estimated simultaneously. This approach treats the covariate\nas deterministic so that the covariate carries no information as to which group\nthe subject is likely to belong to. Although this assumption may be reasonable\nin experiments where the covariate is completely determined by the\nexperimenter, in observational data the covariate may behave differently across\nthe groups. Thus the model should also incorporate the heterogeneity of the\ncovariate, which allows us to estimate the membership of the subject from the\ncovariate.\n  In this paper, we consider a mixture regression model where the joint\ndistribution of the response and the covariate is modeled as a mixture. Given a\nnew observation of the covariate, this approach allows us to compute the\nposterior probabilities that the subject belongs to each group. Using these\nposterior probabilities, the prediction of the response can adaptively use the\ncovariate. We introduce an inference procedure for this approach and show its\nproperties concerning estimation and prediction. The model is explored for the\nfunctional covariate as well as the multivariate covariate. We present a\nreal-data example where our approach outperforms the traditional approach,\nusing the well-analyzed Berkeley growth study data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Jun 2013 02:13:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-02"}

Erasing information implies heat\ndissipation and the energy of 1 bit would then be (the Landauers limit) kT ln\n2, T being the ambient temperature. From a quantum-cosmological point of view\nthe minimum quantum of energy in the universe corresponds today to a\ntemperature of 10^(-29) degrees K, probably forming a cosmic background of a\nBose condensate [1]. Then, the bit with minimum energy today in the Universe is\na quantum of energy 10^(-45)ergs, with an equivalent mass of 10^(-66)g. Low\ntemperature implies low energy per bit and, of course, this is the way for\nfaster and less energy dissipating computing devices. Our conjecture is this:\nthe possibility of a future access to the CBBC (a coupling/channeling?) would\nmean a huge jump in the performance of these devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Jun 2013 13:25:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-24"}
