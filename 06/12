However, the surface sensitivity (which is a key figure of\nmerit for label-free chemical and biological sensing) needs to be carefully\ninvestigated to assess the actual applicability of this technological platform.\nIn this paper, we explore the sensitivity of RAs in metal nanogratings when\nlocal refractive-index changes are considered. Our studies reveal that the\nsurface sensitivity deteriorates up to two orders of magnitude by comparison\nwith the corresponding bulk value; interestingly, this residual sensitivity is\nnot attributable to the wavelength shift of the RAs, which are completely\ninsensitive to local refractive-index changes, but rather to a strictly\nconnected plasmonic effect. Our analysis for increasing overlay thickness\nreveals an ultimate surface sensitivity that approaches the RA bulk value,\nwhich turns out to be the upper-limit of grating-assisted\nsurface-plasmon-polariton sensitivities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Jun 2013 16:01:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 Sep 2013 16:51:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

Here\nwe describe a realistic DIQKD protocol based on interaction between light and\nspins stored in cavities, which allows a heralded mapping of polarisation\nentanglement of light onto the spin. The spin state can subsequently be\nmeasured with near unit efficiency. Heralding alleviates the effect of channel\nloss, and as the protocol allows for local heralding, the spin decay is not\naffected by the communication time between the parties, making Bell inequality\nviolation over an arbitrary distance possible. We compute the achievable key\nrates of the protocol, based on recent estimates of experimentally accessible\nparameter values and compare to the other known DIQKD protocol, which is\nentirely optical.

This\nissue is particularly relevant in view of the enhanced observational\ncapabilities provided by the next generation of Extremely Large Telescopes,\nthat will offer more avenues to employ white dwarfs as probes of Galactic\nevolution and test-beds of fundamental physics. We estimate for the first time\nthe consistency of results obtained from two independent and widely used\nevolutionary codes (BaSTI and LPCODE) for white dwarf models with fixed mass\nand chemical stratification, when the same input physics is employed in both\ncodes. We considered 0.55Msun white dwarf models with both pure carbon and\nuniform carbon-oxygen (50/50 mass fractions) core. We have assessed for the\nfirst time the maximum possible accuracy in the current estimates of white\ndwarf cooling times, resulting only from the different implementations of the\nstellar evolution equations and homogeneous input physics in two independent\nstellar evolution codes. This accuracy amounts to 2% at luminosities lower than\nlog(L/L_{\\sun})= -1.5$. This agreement is true for both pure carbon and uniform\ncarbon-oxygen stratification core models, and also when the release of latent\nheat and carbon-oxygen phase separation are considered. This difference is\nsmaller than the uncertainties in cooling times due to the present\nuncertainties in the white dwarf chemical stratification. We have also\ndetermined quantitatively and explained the effect of varying equation of\nstate, low-temperature radiative opacities and electron conduction opacities in\nour calculation. Finally, we extend the scope of our work by providing\ntabulations of our cooling sequences and the required input physics, that can\nbe used as a comparison test of cooling times obtained from other white dwarf\nevolutionary codes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Jun 2013 16:29:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

They suffer, however, from an\ninter-carrier/inter-symbol interference that complicates signal processing\ntasks such as channel estimation. Most of the methods reported thus far rely on\nthe assumption of (almost) flat subchannels to more easily tackle this problem,\naddressing it in a way similar to OFDM. However, this assumption may be often\nquite inaccurate, due to the high freq. selectivity of the channel and/or the\nsmall number of subcarriers employed to cope with frequency dispersion in fast\nfading. In such cases, severe error floors are exhibited at medium to high SNR\nvalues, which cancel the advantage of FBMC over OFDM. Moreover, the existing\nmethods provide estimates of the subchannel responses, most commonly in the\nfrequency domain. The goal of this paper is to revisit this problem through an\nalternative formulation that focuses on the estimation of the channel impulse\nresponse itself and makes no assumption on the degree of frequency selectivity\nof the subchannels. The possible gains in estimation performance offered by\nsuch an approach are investigated through the design of optimal (in the MSE\nsense) preambles, of both the full and sparse types, and of the smallest\npossible duration of only one pilot FBMC symbol. Existing designs for flat\nsubchannels are then shown to result as special cases. Longer preambles,\nconsisting of two consecutive pilot FBMC symbols, are also analyzed. The\nsimulation results demonstrate significant improvements from the proposed\napproach for both mildly and highly frequency selective channels. Most notably,\nno error floors appear anymore over a quite wide range of SNR values.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Jun 2013 17:01:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 29 Jan 2014 08:12:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-30"}

We use Spitzer IRAC images to identify mid-IR counterparts of\nbright X-ray sources, detected by Chandra in the elliptical galaxy NGC 1399.

Since protein composition determines responses in\nindividual cells, it stands to reason that the variations themselves are\nsubject to selective pressures. But the functional role of these cell-to-cell\ndifferences is not well understood. One way to tackle questions regarding\nrelationships between form and function is to perturb the form (e.g., change\nthe protein abundances) and observe the resulting changes in some function.\nHere we take on the form-function relationship from the inverse perspective,\nasking instead what specific constraints on cell-to-cell variations in protein\nabundance are imposed by a given functional phenotype. We develop a maximum\nentropy (MaxEnt) based approach to posing questions of this type, and\nillustrate the method by application to the well characterized chemotactic\nresponse in Escherichia coli (E. coli). We find that full determination of\nobserved cell-to-cell variations in protein abundances is not inherent in\nchemotaxis itself, but in fact appears to be jointly imposed by the chemotaxis\nprogram in conjunction with other factors, e.g., the protein synthesis\nmachinery and/or additional non-chemotactic cell functions such as cell\nmetabolism.

The 3-40 keV NuSTAR intensity of the inner 20\narcsec (~400 pc) nuclear region varied by a factor of ~2 across the three\nmonitoring observations. The Chandra data reveal that the nuclear region\ncontains three bright X-ray sources, including a luminous (L2-10 keV ~ few x\n10^39 erg/s) point source ~1 arcsec from the dynamical center of the galaxy\n(within the 3sigma positional uncertainty of the dynamical center); this source\ndrives the overall variability of the nuclear region at energies >3 keV. We\nmake use of the variability to measure the spectra of this single hard X-ray\nsource when it was in bright states. The spectra are well described by an\nabsorbed (NH ~ 1.6 x 10^23 cm^-2) broken power-law model with spectral slopes\nand break energies that are typical of ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs), but\nnot AGN.

We undertake a general study of\nmerger-induced star formation in a sample of 5 pc resolution adaptive mesh\nrefinement simulations of low redshift equal-mass mergers with randomly-chosen\norbital parameters. We find that there is an enhanced mass fraction of very\ndense gas that appears as the gas density probability density function evolves\nduring the merger. This finding has implications for the interpretation of some\nobservations; a larger mass fraction of dense gas could account for the\nenhanced HCN/CO ratios seen in ULIRGs and predicts that alpha_CO is lower in\nmergers, as for a given mass of H_2, CO emission will increase in a denser\nenvironment. We also find that as the star formation rate increases, there is a\ncorrelated peak in the velocity dispersion of the gas, which we attribute to\nincreasing turbulence driven by the interaction itself. Star formation tends to\nbe clumpy: in some cases there is extended clumpy star formation, but even when\nstar formation is concentrated within the inner kpc (i.e. what may be\nconsidered a nuclear starburst) it still often has a clumpy, rather than a\nsmooth, distribution.

When the\ncoupling between the elements is repulsive, we observe coexisting states, each\none with its own basin of attraction. These states differ by their degree of\nsynchronization and by patterns of phase-locked motion. When disorder is\nintroduced into the system by additive or multiplicative Gaussian noise, we\nobserve a non-monotonic dependence of the degree of order in the system as a\nfunction of the noise intensity: intervals of noise intensity with low\nsynchronization between the oscillators alternate with intervals where more\noscillators are synchronized. In the latter case, noise induces a higher degree\nof order in the sense of a larger number of nearly coinciding phases. This\norder-by-disorder effect is reminiscent to the analogous phenomenon known from\nspin systems. Surprisingly, this non-monotonic evolution of the degree of order\nis found not only for a single interval of intermediate noise strength, but\nrepeatedly as a function of increasing noise intensity. We observe noise-driven\nmigration of oscillator phases in a rough potential landscape.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Jun 2013 20:15:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 9 Dec 2013 20:53:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

We focus on the simplest spin sectors, namely the highly\npolarized sectors with only one or two overturned spins, i.e., one-particle and\ntwo-particle sectors. Edge-locking is associated with pure imaginary solutions\nof the Bethe equations, which are not commonly encountered in periodic chains.\nIn the one-particle case, at large anisotropies there are two eigenstates with\nimaginary Bethe momenta, related to localization at the two edges. For any\nfinite chain size, one of the two solutions become real as the anisotropy is\nlowered below a certain value. For two particles, a richer scenario is\nobserved, with eigenstates having the possibility of both particles locked on\nthe same or different edge, one locked and the other free, and both free either\nas single magnons or as bound composites corresponding to `string' solutions.\nFor finite chains, some of the edge-locked spins get delocalized at certain\nvalues of the anisotropy (`exceptional points'), corresponding to imaginary\nsolutions becoming real. We characterize these phenomena thoroughly by\nproviding analytic expansions of the Bethe momenta for large chains, large\nanisotropy, and near the exceptional points.

In this paper, we use\nthe redshift space distortion data points to study the growth index on the\nbases of Einstein's gravity theory and a modified gravity theory under the\nassumption of $f=\\Omega_m(a)^{\\gamma_L}$. The cosmic background evolution is\nfixed by the cosmic observations from the type Ia supernovae SNLS3, cosmic\nmicrowave background radiation data from {\\it Planck} and baryon acoustic\noscillations.

The MIMO precoder at each base station (BS) is partitioned\ninto an inner precoder and an outer precoder. The inner precoder controls the\nintra-cell interference and is adaptive to local channel state information\n(CSI) at each BS (CSIT). The outer precoder controls the inter-cell\ninterference and is adaptive to channel statistics. Such hierarchical precoding\nstructure reduces the number of pilot symbols required for CSI estimation in\nmassive MIMO downlink and is robust to the backhaul latency. We study joint\noptimization of the outer precoders, the user selection, and the power\nallocation to maximize a general concave utility which has no closed-form\nexpression. We first apply random matrix theory to obtain an approximated\nproblem with closed-form objective. We show that the solution of the\napproximated problem is asymptotically optimal with respect to the original\nproblem as the number of antennas per BS grows large. Then using the hidden\nconvexity of the problem, we propose an iterative algorithm to find the optimal\nsolution for the approximated problem.

In\nthis work, we characterize the distinguishability of sets of multipartite\nquantum states when restricted to separable measurements -- those which contain\nthe class of local measurements but nevertheless are free of entanglement\nbetween the component systems. We consider two quantities: The separable\nfidelity -- a truly quantum quantity -- which measures how well we can \"clone\"\nthe input state, and the classical probability of success, which simply gives\nthe optimal probability of identifying the state correctly.\n  We obtain lower and upper bounds on the separable fidelity and give several\nexamples in the bipartite and multipartite settings where these bounds are\noptimal. Moreover the optimal values in these cases can be attained by local\nmeasurements. We further show that for distinguishing orthogonal states under\nseparable measurements, a strategy that maximizes the probability of success is\nalso optimal for separable fidelity. We point out that the equality of fidelity\nand success probability does not depend on an using optimal strategy, only on\nthe orthogonality of the states. To illustrate this, we present an example\nwhere two sets (one consisting of orthogonal states, and the other\nnon-orthogonal states) are shown to have the same separable fidelity even\nthough the success probabilities are different.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Jun 2013 05:10:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Nov 2013 11:23:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-14"}

The core of Euclidean geometry is the\nparallel postulate, which provides the basis of the geometric invariant that\nthe sum of the angles in every triangle equals $\\pi$ and Cramer's rule for\nsolving simultaneous linear equations. Since the counterpart of parallel\npostulate in graph theory is not known, which could be the reason that two\nsimilar problems in graph theory, namely the four color theorem (a topological\ninvariant) and the solvability of NP-complete problems (discrete simultaneous\nequations), remain open to date. In this paper, based on the complex coloring\nof cubic graphs, we propose the reducibility postulate of the Petersen\nconfiguration to fill this gap. Comparing edge coloring with a system of linear\nequations, we found that the postulate of reducibility in graph theory and the\nparallel postulate in Euclidean geometry share some common characteristics of\nthe plane. First, they both provide solvability conditions on two equations in\nthe plane. Second, the two basic invariants of the plane, namely the chromatic\nindex of bridgeless cubic plane graphs and the sum of the angles in every\ntriangle, can be respectively deduced from them in a straightforward manner.\nThis reducibility postulation has been verified by more than one hundred\nthousand instances of Peterson configurations generated by computer.

We improve\non the recently introduced method to identify ghost images by means of\nfour-point statistics. Our method is valid for any of the 17 multiply connected\nflat models, including nontoroial ones that are compactified by screw motions\nor glide reflection. Applying the method to the data revealed one possible case\nof topological lensing caused by sixth-turn screw motion, however, it is\nconsistent with the simply connected model by this test alone. Moreover,\nsimulations suggest that we cannot exclude the other space models despite the\nabsence of their signatures. This uncertainty mainly originates from the patchy\ncoverage of SDSS in the South Galactic cap, and the situation will be improved\nby future wide-field spectroscopic surveys.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Jun 2013 08:00:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

A central question concerns their\nfinal masses, and whether fragmentation occurs during their formation. While\nstudies employing Lagrangian codes suggest fragmentation via a self-gravitating\ndisk, recent high resolution simulations indicated that disk formation is\nsuppressed. Here we report the first high-resolution large-eddy simulations\nperformed with the Eulerian grid-based code Enzo following the evolution beyond\nthe formation of the first peak, to investigate the accretion of the central\nmassive clump and potential fragmentation. For a total of 3 halos, we see that\na disk forms around the first clump.

On the\ncontrary, Method of Moments (MM) estimators allow for concise expressions, but\ntests based on these estimators suffer from a lack of efficiency compared to\nlikelihood ratio tests. This is why, in recent years, trade-offs between ML and\nMM estimators have been proposed, resulting in simpler yet not completely\nefficient estimators and tests. In the present paper, we do not propose such a\ntrade-off but rather an optimal combination of both methods, our tests\ninheriting efficiency from an ML-like construction and simplicity from the MM\nestimators of the nuisance parameters. This goal shall be reached by attacking\nthe problem from a new angle, namely via the Le Cam methodology. Besides\nproviding simple efficient testing methods, the theoretical background of this\nmethodology further allows us to write out explicitly power expressions for our\ntests. A Monte Carlo simulation study shows that, also at small sample sizes,\nour simpler procedures do at least as good as the complex likelihood ratio\ntests. We conclude the paper by applying our findings on two real-data sets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Jun 2013 10:15:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 Dec 2013 11:44:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-23"}

Over the last years, twisted-torus geometries\nhave been considered both in Newtonian and general-relativistic equilibrium\nmodels, as they represent a potentially good description of neutron star\ninteriors. All of these works have found an apparent intrinsic limitation to\ngeometries that are poloidal-field-dominated, with a toroidal-to-poloidal\nenergy ratio inside the star that are <10%, unless surface currents are\nincluded and magnetic fields are allowed to be discontinuous. This limitation\nis in stark contrast with the general expectation that much higher toroidal\nfields should be present in the stellar interior and casts doubt about the\nstability and hence realism of these configurations. We here discuss how to\novercome this limitation by adopting a new prescription for the azimuthal\ncurrents that leads to magnetized equilibria where the toroidal-to-total\nmagnetic-field energy ratio can be as high as 90%, thus including geometries\nthat are toroidal-field-dominated.

This\nmodel assumes that input to V1 neurons is dominated by feed-forward projections\noriginating from a small set of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). The typical\nspacing between adjacent cortical orientation columns preferring the same\norientation then arises via Moir\\'{e}-Interference between hexagonal ON/OFF RGC\nmosaics. While this Moir\\'{e}-Interference critically depends on long-range\nhexagonal order within the RGC mosaics, a recent statistical analysis of RGC\nreceptive field positions found no evidence for such long-range positional\norder. Hexagonal order may be only one of several ways to obtain spatially\nrepetitive OPMs in the statistical connectivity model. Here, we investigate a\nmore general requirement on the spatial structure of RGC mosaics that can seed\nthe emergence of spatially repetitive cortical OPMs, namely that angular\ncorrelations between so-called RGC dipoles exhibit a spatial structure similar\nto that of OPM autocorrelation functions. Both in cat beta cell mosaics as well\nas primate parasol receptive field mosaics we find that RGC dipole angles are\nspatially uncorrelated. To help assess the level of these correlations, we\nintroduce a novel point process that generates mosaics with realistic nearest\nneighbor statistics and a tunable degree of spatial correlations of dipole\nangles. Using this process, we show that given the size of available data sets,\nthe presence of even weak angular correlations in the data is very unlikely.

This leads us to conclude that the mLE is a very\npoor ergodicity indicator, since it is not sensitive to the trajectory being\nconfined to a subregion of phase space. The eventual thermalization of a BEC in\na disordered lattice cannot be predicted based only on the chaoticity of its\nphase space trajectory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Jun 2013 12:59:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-14"}

Other engineering\nexamples (control theory, elasticity theory, electromagnetism) will also be\nconsidered in order to illustrate the three fundamental results that we shall\nprovide. The paper is therefore divided into three parts corresponding to the\ndifferent formal methods used. 1) CARTAN VERSUS VESSIOT: The quadratic terms\nappearing in the \" Riemann tensor \" according to the \" Vessiot structure\nequations \" must not be identified with the quadratic terms appearing in the\nwell known \" Cartan structure equations \" for Lie groups and a similar comment\ncan be done for the \" Weyl tensor \". In particular, \" curvature+torsion\"\n(Cartan) must not be considered as a generalization of \"curvature alone\"\n(Vessiot). Roughly, Cartan and followers have not been able to \" quotient down\nto the base manifold \", a result only obtained by Spencer in 1970 through the\n\"nonlinear Spencer sequence\" but in a way quite different from the one followed\nby Vessiot in 1903 for the same purpose and still ignored. 2) JANET VERSUS\nSPENCER: The \" Ricci tensor \" only depends on the nonlinear transformations\n(called \" elations \" by Cartan in 1922) that describe the \"difference \"\nexisting between the Weyl group (10 parameters of the Poincar\\'e subgroup + 1\ndilatation) and the conformal group of space-time (15 parameters). It can be\ndefined by a canonical splitting, that is to say without using the indices\nleading to the standard contraction or trace of the Riemann tensor. Meanwhile,\nwe shall obtain the number of components of the Riemann and Weyl tensors\nwithout any combinatoric argument on the exchange of indices. Accordingly, the\nSpencer sequence for the conformal Killing system and its formal adjoint fully\ndescribe the Cosserat/Maxwell/Weyl theory but General Relativity is not\ncoherent at all with this result. 3) ALGEBRAIC ANALYSIS: Contrary to other\nequations of physics (Cauchy equations, Cosserat equations, Maxwell equations),\nthe Einstein equations cannot be \" parametrized \", that is the generic solution\ncannot be expressed by means of the derivatives of a certain number of\narbitrary potential-like functions, solving therefore negatively a 1000 $\nchallenge proposed by J. Wheeler in 1970. Accordingly, the mathematical\nfoundations of mathematical physics must be revisited within this formal\nframework, though striking it may look like for certain apparently well\nestablished theories such as electromagnetism and general relativity. We insist\non the fact that the arguments presented are of a purely mathematical nature\nand are thus unavoidable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Jun 2013 13:19:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

We use this structure to obtain two different decompositions of\nsuch spaces, one indexed over the prime MV-spectrum, the other over the maximal\nMV-spectrum. These decompositions yield sheaf representations of MV-algebras,\nusing a new and purely duality-theoretic result that relates certain sheaf\nrepresentations of distributive lattices to decompositions of their dual\nspaces. Importantly, the proofs of the MV-algebraic representation theorems\nthat we obtain in this way are distinguished from the existing work on this\ntopic by the following features: (1) we use only basic algebraic facts about\nMV-algebras; (2) we show that the two aforementioned sheaf representations are\nspecial cases of a common result, with potential for generalizations; and (3)\nwe show that these results are strongly related to the structure of the\nStone-Priestley duals of MV-algebras. In addition, using our analysis of these\ndecompositions, we prove that MV-algebras with isomorphic underlying lattices\nhave homeomorphic maximal MV-spectra.

Second the h-BN thickness was reduced down to six atomic\nlayers, using mechanical exfoliation, as evidenced by atomic force microscopy.\nEven at these low thicknesses, the luminescence remains intense and exciton\nrecombination energies are not strongly modified with respect to the bulk, as\nexpected from theoretical calculations indicating extremely compact excitons in\nh-BN.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Jun 2013 14:56:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 6 Feb 2014 15:38:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-07"}

However, six out of 31\nexcess sources in the Herschel OTKP DUNES have been seen to show significant -\nand in some cases extended - excess emission at 160{\\mu}m, which is larger than\nthe 100{\\mu}m excess. This excess emission has been suggested to stem from\ndebris disks colder than those known previously. Using several methods, we\nre-consider whether some or even all of the candidates may be associated with\nunrelated galactic or extragalactic emission and conclude that it is highly\nunlikely that none of the candidates represents a true circumstellar disk. For\ntrue disks, both the dust temperatures inferred from the SEDs and the disk\nradii estimated from the images suggest that the dust is nearly as cold as a\nblackbody. This requires the grains to be larger than ~100{\\mu}m, regardless of\ntheir material composition. To explain the dearth of small grains, we explore\nseveral conceivable scenarios: transport-dominated disks, disks of low\ndynamical excitation, and disks of unstirred primordial macroscopic grains. Our\nqualitative analysis and collisional simulations rule out the first two of\nthese scenarios, but show the feasibility of the third one. We show that such\ndisks can survive for gigayears, largely preserving the primordial size\ndistribution.

Thus planetesimal formation,\nat least in the outer regions of the systems, has stopped before \"cometary\" or\n\"asteroidal\" sizes were reached.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Jun 2013 15:04:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

The\nmotivation of the RDPSO algorithm is described first, and the velocity equation\nof the particle is designed by simulating the thermal motion as well as the\ndrift motion of the electrons, both of which lead the electrons to a location\nwith minimum potential energy in the external electric field.

These\nprocesses allow for modeling of phenomena where the regularity properties can\nchange with time either continuously or through jumps, such as in the\nvolatility of a stock or in Internet traffic. Some properties of the sample\npaths of the new process class, including different types of continuity and\nlong-range dependence, are discussed. It is found that the regularity\nproperties of the Hurst function chosen directly correspond to the regularity\nproperties of the sample paths of the processes. The long-range dependence\nproperty of fractional Brownian motion is preserved in the larger process\nclass. As an application, Fokker-Planck-type equations for a time-changed\nfractional Brownian motion with variable Hurst parameter are found.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Jun 2013 15:52:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-08"}

It would allowed for a liquid ocean on the terrestrial\nsurface which, otherwise, would have been frozen, contrary to the empirical\nevidence. By further assuming that some physical mechanism subsequently\ndisplaced the Earth towards its current distance in such a way that the\nirradiance stayed substantially constant over the entire Archean from 3.8 Gyr\nto 2.5 Gyr ago, a relative recession rate as large as \\dot r/r \\simeq 3.4 x\n10^-11 yr^-1 would have been required. Although such a figure is roughly of the\nsame order of magnitude of the value of the Hubble parameter 3.8 Gyr ago H_Ar =\n1.192 H_0 = 8.2 x 10^-11 yr^-1, standard general relativity rules out\ncosmological explanations for the hypothesized Earth' s recession rate.\nInstead, a class of modified theories of gravitation with nonminimal coupling\nbetween the matter and the metric naturally predicts a secular variation of the\nrelative distance of a localized two-body system, thus yielding a potentially\nviable candidate to explain the putative recession of the Earth' s orbit.\nAnother competing mechanism of classical origin which could, in principle,\nallow for the desired effect is the mass loss which either the Sun or the Earth\nitself may have experienced during the Archean. On the one hand, this implies\nthat our planet should have lost 2% of its present mass in the form of\neroded/evaporated hydrosphere which, thus, should have been two orders of\nmagnitude larger than now. On the other hand, it is widely believed that the\nSun could have lost mass at an enhanced rate due to a stronger solar wind in\nthe past for not more than \\sim 0.2-0.3 Gyr.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Jun 2013 08:23:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Jun 2013 13:11:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 22 Jun 2013 15:07:58 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 11 Oct 2013 10:24:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-21"}

This work offers new\ninsights for the interpretation of planetary survey data. Evolution equations\nfor poloidal and toroidal motions include gradients of density, viscosity, and\ntwo normal stress moduli. The poloidal field exhibits gradients in the cubic\ndilation, which couple non-isotropic pressures to the combined deformation\nfield. In contrast, the toroidal field exhibits vorticity gradients with\nmagnitudes proportional to the natural time. This holds even in the absence of\nmaterial gradients. Consequently, viscosity gradients are not required to drive\ntoroidal motions. The toroidal field is governed by an inhomogeneous diharmonic\nequation, exhibiting dynamic shear localization. The strain-energy density for\nthis model, as a function of temperature, is found via thermodynamics. Assuming\nheat transfer with characteristic diffusivity, a radial model parameterized by\nthermomechanical competence is found. Shear dislocations, admissible for\nthermomechanical competence greater than 1/2, are found to coincide with\nsupershear rupture speeds for in-plane (Mode II) cracks. This range of\nthermomechanical competence coincides with depths in the crust, upper mantle\nand transition zone where earthquake foci are observed. Consequently, all\nseismic sources must exhibit some supershearing component. Observed variations\nin Earth's gravity-topography admittance and correlation spectra, and\nearthquake moment-depth release are interpreted in light of this hypothetical\nstructure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Jun 2013 16:59:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-17"}

By caching a portion of the media files, the BSs\nopportunistically employ CoMP to transform the cross-link interference into\nspatial multiplexing gain. We study a mixed-timescale optimization of MIMO\nprecoding and cache control to minimize the transmit power under the rate\nconstraint. The cache control is to create more CoMP opportunities and is\nadaptive to the long-term popularity of the media files. The precoding is to\nguarantee the rate requirement and is adaptive to the channel state information\nand cache state at the BSs. The joint stochastic optimization problem is\ndecomposed into a short-term precoding and a long-term cache control problem.\nWe propose a precoding algorithm which converges to a stationary point of the\nshort-term problem.
