At the\nmoderate resolving power of the MARVELS spectrograph and the spectrographs used\nfor subsequent radial-velocity (RV) measurements (R ~ <30,000), this particular\nstellar binary mimics a single-lined binary with an RV signal that would be\ninduced by a brown dwarf companion (Msin(i)~50 M_Jup) to a solar-type primary.\nAt least three properties of this system allow it to masquerade as a single\nstar with a very low-mass companion: its large eccentricity (e~0.8), its\nrelatively long period (P~238 days), and the approximately perpendicular\norientation of the semi-major axis with respect to the line of sight (omega~189\ndegrees). As a result of these properties, for ~95% of the orbit the two sets\nof stellar spectral lines are completely blended, and the RV measurements based\non centroiding on the apparently single-lined spectrum is very well fit by an\norbit solution indicative of a brown dwarf companion on a more circular orbit\n(e~0.3).

Finally, for surveys like MARVELS that lack the\nresolution for a useful line bisector analysis, it is imperative to monitor the\npeak of the cross-correlation function for suspicious changes in width or\nshape, so that such false positives can be flagged during the candidate vetting\nprocess.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Jun 2013 16:24:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-14"}

In this study, we investigate whether the evolution of\ncluster scaling relations is affected by the spurious evolution of mass caused\nby the evolving reference density with respect to which halo masses are defined\n(pseudo-evolution). We use the relation between mass, M, and velocity\ndispersion, sigma, as a test case, and show that the deviation from the M-sigma\nrelation of cluster-sized halos caused by pseudo-evolution is smaller than 10%\nfor a wide range of mass definitions. The reason for this small impact is a\ntight relation between the velocity dispersion and mass profiles, sigma(<r) =\nconst * (GM(<r) / r)^1/2, which holds across a wide range of radii. We show\nthat such a relation is generically expected for a variety of density profiles,\nas long as halos are in approximate Jeans equilibrium. Thus, as the outer\n\"virial\" radius used to define the halo mass, R, increases due to\npseudo-evolution, halos approximately preserve their M-sigma relation. This\nresult highlights the fact that tight scaling relations are the result of tight\nequilibrium relations between radial profiles of physical quantities. We find\nexceptions at very small and very large radii, where the profiles deviate from\nthe relations they exhibit at intermediate radii. We discuss the implications\nof these results for other cluster scaling relations, and argue that\npseudo-evolution should have a small effect on most scaling relations, except\nfor those that involve the stellar masses of galaxies.

These lead to\npredictions for the anomalous dimensions at all points in the fundamental\ndomain of the complex gauge coupling, and in particular at the\nduality-invariant values \\tau=i and \\tau=exp(i\\pi/3). For low-rank gauge\ngroups, the predictions are compatible with the bounds derived by conformal\nbootstrap methods for these anomalous dimensions; within numerical errors, they\nare in good agreement with the conjecture that said bounds are saturated at a\nduality-invariant point. We also find that the anomalous dimensions of the\nlowest twist operators lie within an extremely narrow window around a straight\nline as we vary the moduli of the theory over the two dimensional fundamental\ndomain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Jun 2013 20:00:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-22"}

Restricting a global\nfunction to a spatial subdomain -- whether by necessity or by design -- is a\nwindowing operation, and an equation like a convolution in the spectral domain\nrelates the expected value of the windowed power spectrum to the underlying\nglobal power spectrum and the known power spectrum of the localization window.\nThe best windows for the purpose of localized spectral analysis have their\nenergy concentrated in the region of interest while possessing the smallest\neffective bandwidth as possible. Solving an optimization problem in the sense\nof Slepian (1960) yields a family of orthogonal windows of diminishing\nspatiospectral localization, the best concentrated of which we propose to use\nto form a weighted multitaper spectrum estimate in the sense of Thomson (1982).\nSuch an estimate is both more representative of the target region and reduces\nthe estimation variance when compared to estimates formed by any single\nbandlimited window. We describe how the weights applied to the individual\nspectral estimates in forming the multitaper estimate can be chosen such that\nthe variance of the estimate is minimized.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Jun 2013 20:43:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-17"}

Both single- particle and thermodynamic properties of the model are\nstudied in detail. Our solution features a metal-insulator transition at half\nfilling. The resulting metal-insulator phase diagram agrees qual- itatively\nvery well with the one obtained within Dynamical Mean-Field Theory. We discuss\nthe type of transition (Mott-Hubbard (MH) or charge-transfer (CT)) for the\nmicroscopic (ab-initio) parameter range relevant for cuprates getting, as\nexpected a CT type. The emerging single-particle scenario clearly suggests a\nvery close relation between the relevant sub-bands of the three- (Emery) and\nthe single- band (Hubbard) models, thus providing an independent and\nnon-perturbative proof of the validity of the mapping between the two models\nfor the model parameters optimal to describe cuprates. Such a result confirms\nthe emergence of the Zhang-Rice scenario, which has been recently questioned.\nWe also report the behavior of the specific heat and of the entropy as\nfunctions of the temperature on varying the model parameters as these\nquantities, more than any other, depend on and, consequently, reveal the most\nrelevant energy scales of the system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Jun 2013 21:33:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-17"}

Here we present a range of calculations we performed to\nstudy the dependence of water loss rates from terrestrial planets on a range of\natmospheric and external parameters. We show that CO2 can only cause\nsignificant water loss by increasing surface temperatures over a narrow range\nof conditions, with cooling of the middle and upper atmosphere acting as a\nbottleneck on escape in other circumstances. Around G-stars, efficient loss\nonly occurs on planets with intermediate CO2 atmospheric partial pressures (0.1\nto 1 bar) that receive a net flux close to the critical runaway greenhouse\nlimit. Because G-star total luminosity increases with time but XUV/UV\nluminosity decreases, this places strong limits on water loss for planets like\nEarth. In contrast, for a CO2-rich early Venus, diffusion limits on water loss\nare only important if clouds caused strong cooling, implying that scenarios\nwhere the planet never had surface liquid water are indeed plausible. Around\nM-stars, water loss is primarily a function of orbital distance, with planets\nthat absorb less flux than ~270 W/m^2 (global mean) unlikely to lose more than\none Earth ocean of H2O over their lifetimes unless they lose all their\natmospheric N2/CO2 early on.

Furthermore, we find that, if the progenitors of the sdB\nstars have initial masses below the helium flash mass, the sdB binaries\nproduced from stable RLOF follow a unique mass -- orbital period relation for a\ngiven metallicity $Z$; increasing the orbital period from $\\sim 400$ to $\\sim\n1100$\\,d corresponds to increasing the mass of the sdB star from $\\sim 0.40$ to\n$\\sim 0.49\\,M_\\odot$ for $Z=0.02$. We suggest that the longest sdB binaries\n(with orbital period $> 1100$\\,d) could be the result of atmospheric RLOF. The\nmass -- orbital period relation can be tested observationally if the mass of\nthe sdB star can be determined precisely, e.g.\\ from asteroseismology. Using\nthis relation, we revise the orbital period distribution of sdB binaries\nproduced by the first stable RLOF channel for the best fitting model of Han et\nal (2003), and show that the orbital period has a peak around 830\\,d.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Jun 2013 02:32:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

It was previously\nbelieved that the surface of an ETI must be gapless unless one of these\nsymmetries is broken. A well-known symmetry-preserving, gapless surface\ntermination of an ETI supports an odd number of Dirac cones. In this paper we\ndeduce a symmetry-respecting, gapped surface termination of an ETI, which\ncarries an intrinsic 2d topological order, Moore-Read x anti-semion. The\nMoore-Read sector supports non-Abelian charge 1/4 anyons, while the Abelian,\nanti-semion sector is electrically neutral.

Due\nto the complementarity of the two modalities, we fuse the corresponding\nmatching scores and learn their relative weighting in a data specific manner by\noptimizing discriminative performance on synthetically distorted data. For the\ntextural description of an object we adopt a representation in the form of a\nhistogram of SIFT based visual words. Similarly the apparent shape of an object\nis represented by a histogram of discretized features capturing local shape. On\na large public database of a diverse set of objects, the proposed method is\nshown to outperform significantly both purely textural and purely shape based\napproaches for matching across viewpoint variation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Jun 2013 05:52:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-17"}

In this\nwork we introduce a general technique applicable to any higher dimensional\nlattice. We point out that the Coxeter number and the Coxeter exponents of a\nCoxeter-Weyl group play a crucial role in determining the plane onto which the\nlattice to be projected as well as the dihedral symmetry of the quasicrystal\nstructure. The eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the Cartan matrix are used to\ndetermine the set of orthonormal vectors in nD Euclidean space which lead\nsuitable choices for the projection subspaces. The maximal dihedral subgroup of\nthe Coxeter-Weyl group is identified to determine the symmetry of the\nquasicrystal structure. We give examples for 12-fold symmetric quasicrystal\nstructures obtained by projecting the higher dimensional lattices determined by\nthe affine Coxeter-Weyl groups Wa(F4), Wa(B6) and Wa(E6) . These groups share\nthe same Coxeter number h=12 with different Coxeter exponents. The dihedral\nsubgroup D12 of the Coxeter groups can be obtained by defining two generators\nR1 and R2 as the products of generators of the Coxeter-Weyl groups. The\nreflection generators R1 and R2 operate in the Coxeter planes where the Coxeter\nelement R1R2 of the Coxeter group represents the rotation of order 12. The\ncanonical projections (strip projections) of the lattices determine the nature\nof the quasicrystallographic structures with 12-fold symmetry as well as the\ncrystallographic structures with 4-fold and 6-fold symmetry. We note that the\nquasicrystal structures obtained from the lattices Wa(F4) and Wa(B6) and are\ncompatible with the experimental results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Jun 2013 07:35:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 8 Sep 2013 06:03:34 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 5 Mar 2014 11:06:49 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 10 Sep 2014 12:37:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

However, the\nsame representation and reconstruction framework is not readily applicable in a\nstreaming system: the unknown signal changes over time, and it is measured and\nreconstructed sequentially over small time intervals.\n  In this paper, we discuss two such streaming systems and a homotopy-based\nalgorithm for quickly solving the associated L1-norm minimization programs: 1)\nRecovery of a smooth, time-varying signal for which, instead of using block\ntransforms, we use lapped orthogonal transforms for sparse representation. 2)\nRecovery of a sparse, time-varying signal that follows a linear dynamic model.\nFor both the systems, we iteratively process measurements over a sliding\ninterval and estimate sparse coefficients by solving a weighted L1-norm\nminimization program.

According to this interpretation, the low metallicity stars in the\nfield of Fornax, populating the HB at colours bluer than the blue side\n((V-I)o<=0.3 or (B-V)o<=0.2) of the RR Lyrs, should be second generation stars\nborn in the clusters;a preliminary analysis of available colour surveys of\nFornax field provides a fraction ~20% of blue HB stars, in the low metallicity\nrange; 2) the mass loss from individual second generation red giants is a few\npercent of a solar mass larger than the mass loss from first generation stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Jun 2013 09:51:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Jun 2013 08:16:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

Understanding the transport of energetic\nparticles and the acceleration mechanisms for charged particles is an important\ngoal of today's astroparticle physics. Aims: To understand the acceleration\nmechanisms at the particle source, subsequent effects have to be known.\nTherefore, the modification of a particle energy distribution, due to\nstochastic acceleration, needs to be investigated. Methods: The diffusion in\nmomentum space was investigated by using both a Monte-Carlo simulation code and\nby analytically solving the momentum-diffusion equation. For simplicity, the\nturbulence was assumed to consist of one-dimensional Alfven waves. Results:\nUsing both methods, it is shown that, on average, all particles with velocities\ncomparable to the Alfven speeds are accelerated. This influences the energy\ndistribution by significantly increasing the energy spectral index.\nConclusions: Because of electromagnetic turbulence, a particle energy spectrum\nmeasured at Earth can drastically deviate from its initial spectrum.

Transition to this form of dynamo is subcritical and shares many\ncharacteristics of transition to turbulence in non-rotating hydrodynamic shear\nflows. This suggests that these different fluid systems become active through\nsimilar generic bifurcation mechanisms, which in both cases have eluded\ndetailed understanding so far. In this paper, we investigate numerically the\nbifurcation mechanisms at work in the incompressible Keplerian\nmagnetorotational dynamo problem in the shearing box framework. Using numerical\ntechniques imported from dynamical systems research, we show that the onset of\nchaotic dynamo action at magnetic Prandtl numbers larger than unity is\nprimarily associated with global homoclinic and heteroclinic bifurcations of\nnonlinear magnetorotational dynamo cycles. These global bifurcations are\nsupplemented by local bifurcations of cycles marking the beginning of\nperiod-doubling cascades.

Studying the nonlinear physics\nand bifurcations of these cycles in different regimes and configurations may\nsubsequently help to better understand the conditions of excitation of\nmagnetohydrodynamic turbulence and instability-driven dynamos in various\nastrophysical systems and laboratory experiments.

We consider two\nmodels. In the first, the incoming particle is classicalized by coupling it to\nan environment described by a standard Lindblad master equation diagonalizing\nin position.

A\ndifferent Lindblad master diagonalizing in momentum is shown to be successful\nin suppressing reflection without large fluctuations but such a master equation\nis unphysical. We consider a second model in which the barrier is modelled\nquantum-mechanically by a massive target particle coupled to an environment to\nmaintain it in a quasi-classical state. This avoids the fluctuations problem\nsince the incoming particle is not coupled to the environment directly.

Methods: We combine high-resolution\nSoHO/MDI magnetograms with TRACE observations taken in the 1216 {\\AA} channel\nin order to analyze the temporal evolution of an emerging small-scale magnetic\nloop and its traces in the chromosphere. Results: At first place, we find\nsignatures of flux emergence very close to the edge of a supergranular network\nboundary located at disk center. The new emerging flux appears first in the MDI\nmagnetograms in form of an asymmetric bipolar element, i.e. the patch with\nnegative polarity is roughly two-times weaker than the corresponding patch with\nopposite polarity. The average values of magnetic flux and magnetic flux\ndensities reach 1.6 x 10^18 Mx, -8.5 x 10^17 Mx, and 55 Mx cm^-2, -30 Mx cm^-2,\nrespectively. The spatial distance between the opposite polarity patches of the\nemerged feature increases from about 2.5\" to 5.0\" during the lifetime of the\nloop which was not longer than 36 min. A more precise lifetime-estimate of the\nfeature was not possible because of a gap in the temporal sequence of the MDI\nmagnetograms. The chromospheric response to the emerged magnetic dipole occurs\n~ 9 minutes later with respect to the photospheric magnetograms. It consists of\na quasi-periodic sequence of time-localized brightenings visible in the 1216\n{\\AA} TRACE channel apparent for ~ 14 minutes and being co-spatial with the\naxis connecting the two patches of opposite magnetic polarity. Conclusions: We\nidentify the observed event as a small-scale magnetic loop emerging at\nphotospheric layers and subsequently rising up to the chromosphere. We discuss\nthe possibility that the fluctuations detected in the chromospheric emission\nprobably reflect magnetic field oscillations which propagate to the\nchromosphere in form of waves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Jun 2013 13:32:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

The model suggests that after introduction goods spread always\naccording to a Bass diffusion. However, this phase will be followed by a\ndiffusion process for durable consumer goods governed by a\nvariation-selection-reproduction mechanism and the growth dynamics can be\ndescribed by a replicator equation. Describing the aggregate sales as the sum\nof first, multiple and replacement purchase the product life cycle can be\nderived. Replacement purchase causes periodic variations of the sales\ndetermined by the finite lifetime of the good (Juglar cycles). The model\nsuggests that both, Bass- and Gompertz diffusion may contribute to the product\nlife cycle of a consumer durable. The theory contains the standard equilibrium\nview of a market as a special case. It depends on the time scale, whether an\nequilibrium or evolutionary description is more appropriate. The evolutionary\nframework is used to derive also the size, growth rate and price distribution\nof manufacturing business units. It predicts that the size distribution of the\nbusiness units (products) is lognormal, while the growth rates exhibit a\nLaplace distribution. Large price deviations from the mean price are also\ngoverned by a Laplace distribution (fat tails). These results are in agreement\nwith empirical findings.

In some cases, these outflows can carry energy in excess of the\nbinding energy of the host galaxy. Needless to say, these features demand our\nattention as they are strong signatures of AGN feedback and will influence\ngalaxy evolution. For the same reason, alternative models need to be discussed\nand refuted or confirmed. Gallo & Fabian proposed that some of these features\ncould arise from resonance absorption of the reflected spectrum in a layer of\nionised material located above and corotating with the accretion disc.\nTherefore, the absorbing medium would be subjected to similar blurring effects\nas seen in the disc. A priori, the existence of such plasma above the disc is\nas plausible as a fast wind. In this work, we highlight the ambiguity by\ndemonstrating that the absorption model can describe the ~7.6 keV absorption\nfeature (and possibly other features) in the quasar PG 1211+143, an AGN that is\noften described as a classic example of an UFO. In this model, the 2-10 keV\nspectrum would be largely reflection dominated (as opposed to power law\ndominated in the wind models) and the resonance absorption would be originating\nin a layer between about 6 and 60 gravitational radii. The studies of such\nfeatures constitutes a cornerstone for future X-ray observatories like Astro-H\nand Athena+. Should our model prove correct, or at least important in some\ncases, then absorption will provide another diagnostic tool with which to probe\nthe inner accretion flow with future missions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Jun 2013 14:11:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

In sharp contrast, in\nNetONet, due to the cascading failures, the percolation transition may be\ndiscontinuous and even a single node failure may lead to abrupt collapse of the\nsystem.

Because some\ndeparting flights are held at gates, there is a possibility that arriving\nflights cannot access the gates and have to wait until the gates are cleared.\nThis is called a gate conflict. Robust gate assignment is an assignment that\nminimizes gate conflicts by assigning gates to aircraft to maximize the time\ngap between two consecutive flights at the same gate; it makes gate assignment\nrobust, but passengers may walk longer to transfer flights. In order to\nsimulate the airport departure process, a queuing model is introduced. The\nmodel is calibrated and validated with actual data from New York La Guardia\nAirport (LGA) and a U.S. hub airport. Then, the model simulates the airport\ndeparture process with the current gate assignment and a robust gate assignment\nto assess the impact of gate assignment on gate-holding departure control.

Let us take as an example a new\ntherapy to treat cancer being compared to an existing therapy with\neffectiveness taken as time to death. A challenging problem is that the ICER is\ndefined in terms of means over the entire treatment groups. It makes no\nprovision for stratification by groups of patients with differing risk of\ndeath. For example, for a fair and unbiased analysis, one would desire to\ncompare time to death in groups with similar life expectancy which would be\nimpacted by factors such as age, gender, disease severity, etc. The method we\ndecided to apply is borrowed by cluster analysis and aims at (i) discard any\noutliers in the set under analysis that may arise, (ii) identify groups (i.e.\nclusters) of patients with \"similar\" key factors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Jun 2013 07:42:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Jun 2013 07:12:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-19"}
