In contrast, only minimal data are usually given\nabout demographic factors. Yet, some of these factors can have a notable impact\non the overall death rate, thereby changing the outcome and conclusions of the\ntrial. This paper focuses on two of these variables. The first is marital\nstatus; this effect, which will be referred to as the Bertillon effect, may\nchange death rates by over 100%. The second is the age of the oldest patients;\nbecause of the exponential nature of Gompertz's law, changes in the\ndistribution of ages in the oldest age group can have dramatic consequences on\nthe overall number of deaths. It will be seen that randomization alone can\nhardly take care of these problems. Appropriate remedies are easy to formulate\nhowever. First, the marital status of patients as well as the age distribution\nof those over 65 should be documented for both study groups. Then, thanks to\nthese data and based on the Bertillon and Gompertz laws, it will become\npossible to perform appropriate corrections. Such corrections will notably\nimprove the reliability and accuracy of the trial's conclusions, especially for\ntrials which include a large proportion of elderly subjects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Jun 2013 16:09:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

In particular, we are interested in\nmathematical constraints that can be imposed on the functional form of the\nFourier power-spectrum density (PSD) that exhibits a multiply broken shape and\nseveral local maxima. We develop a methodology for determining the regions of\nthe model parameter space that can in principle reproduce a PSD shape with a\ngiven number and position of local peaks and breaks of the PSD slope. Given the\nvast space of possible parameters, it is an important requirement that the\nmethod is fast in estimating the PSD shape for a given parameter set of the\nmodel. We generated and discuss the theoretical PSD profiles of a\nshot-noise-type random process with exponentially decaying flares. Then we\ndetermined conditions under which one, two, or more breaks or local maxima\noccur in the PSD. We calculated positions of these features and determined the\nchanging slope of the model PSD. Furthermore, we considered the influence of\nthe modulation by the orbital motion for a variability pattern assumed to\nresult from an orbiting-spot model. We suggest that our general methodology can\nbe useful in for describing non-monotonic PSD profiles (such as the trend seen,\non different scales, in exemplary cases of the high-mass X-ray binary Cygnus\nX-1 and the narrow-line Seyfert galaxy Ark 564).

Previous observations of these flows primarily come from H-alpha\nand cool EUV lines (e.g., 304A) where estimates of the size of the prominence\nthreads has been limited by the resolution of the available instrumentation.\nEvidence of `counter-steaming' flows has previously been inferred from these\ncool plasma observations but now, for the first time, these flows have been\ndirectly imaged along fundamental filament threads within the million degree\ncorona (at 193A). In this work we present observations of an active region\nfilament observed with Hi-C that exhibits anti-parallel flows along adjacent\nfilament threads. Complementary data from SDO/AIA and HMI are presented. The\nultra-high spatial and temporal resolution of Hi-C allow the anti-parallel flow\nvelocities to be measured (70-80 km/s) and gives an indication of the\nresolvable thickness of the individual strands (0.8'' +/- 0.1''). The\ntemperature distribution of the plasma flows was estimated to be log T(K) =\n5.45 +/- 0.10 using EM loci analysis. We find that SDO/AIA cannot clearly\nobserve these anti-parallel flows nor measure their velocity or thread width\ndue to its larger pixel size. We suggest that\n  anti-parallel/counter-streaming flows are likely commonplace within all\nfilaments and are currently not observed in EUV due to current instrument\nspatial resolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Jun 2013 16:43:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

One of the most\nimportant assumptions is that the Darcy model assumes the drag coefficient to\nbe constant. However, there is irrefutable experimental evidence that\nviscosities of organic liquids and carbon-dioxide depend on the pressure.\nExperiments have also shown that the drag varies nonlinearly with respect to\nthe velocity at high flow rates. In important technological applications like\nenhanced oil recovery and geological carbon-dioxide sequestration, one\nencounters both high pressures and high flow rates. It should be emphasized\nthat flow characteristics and pressure variation under varying drag are both\nquantitatively and qualitatively different from that of constant drag.\nMotivated by experimental evidence, we consider the drag coefficient to depend\non both the pressure and velocity.

It is unclear how this recent population growth,\ncombined with the effects of negative natural selection, has affected patterns\nof deleterious variation, as well as the number, frequencies, and effect sizes\nof mutations that contribute risk to complex traits. Here I use simulations\nunder population genetic models where a proportion of the heritability of the\ntrait is accounted for by mutations in a subset of the exome. I show that\nrecent population growth increases the proportion of nonsynonymous variants\nsegregating in the population, but does not affect the genetic load relative to\nthat in a population that did not expand. Under a model where a mutation's\neffect on a trait is correlated with its effect on fitness, rare variants\nexplain a greater portion of the additive genetic variance of the trait in a\npopulation that has recently expanded than in a population that did not\nrecently expand. Further, when using a single-marker test, for a given\nfalse-positive rate and sample size, recent population growth decreases the\nexpected number of significant association with the trait relative to the\nnumber detected in a population that did not expand. However, in a model where\nthere is no correlation between a mutation's effect on fitness and the effect\non the trait, common variants account for much of the additive genetic\nvariance, regardless of demography. Moreover, here demography does not affect\nthe number of significant association detected.

Our\ncampaign was conducted between October, 2011, and January, 2012. We were able\nto obtain 44 epochs of observations in each of the H and Ks filters. Based on\nthe final accuracy of our observations, we do not find any strong evidence of\nshort-term NIR variability at amplitudes of >0.15-0.2 mag for TMR-1C or\nTMR-1AB. Our present observations, however, have reconfirmed the\nlarge-amplitude long-term variations in the NIR emission for TMR-1C, which were\nearlier observed between 1998 and 2002, and have also shown that no particular\ncorrelation exists between the brightness and the color changes. TMR-1C became\nbrighter in the H-band by ~1.8 mag between 1998 and 2002, and then fainter\nagain by ~0.7 mag between 2002 and 2011. In contrast, it has persistently\nbecome brighter in the Ks-band in the period between 1998 and 2011. The (H-Ks)\ncolor for TMR-1C shows large variations, from a red value of 1.3+/-0.07 and\n1.6+/-0.05 mag in 1998 and 2000, to a much bluer color of -0.1+/-0.5 mag in\n2002, and then again a red color of 1.1+/-0.08 mag in 2011. The observed\nvariability from 1998 to 2011 suggests that TMR-1C becomes fainter when it gets\nredder, as expected from variable extinction, while the brightening observed in\nthe Ks-band could be due to physical variations in its inner disk structure.\nThe NIR colors for TMR-1C obtained using the high precision photometry from\n1998, 2000, and 2011 observations are similar to the protostars in Taurus,\nsuggesting that it could be a faint dusty Class I source.

The method is based on a key sociological insight\nthat has been developed and extensively verified over the last twenty years,\nbut has yet to make an impact in artificial intelligence. The insight is that\nresource bounded humans will, by default, act to maintain affective\nconsistency. Humans have culturally shared fundamental affective sentiments\nabout identities, behaviours, and objects, and they act so that the transient\naffective sentiments created during interactions confirm the fundamental\nsentiments. Humans seek and create situations that confirm or are consistent\nwith, and avoid and supress situations that disconfirm or are inconsistent\nwith, their culturally shared affective sentiments. This \"affect control\nprinciple\" has been shown to be a powerful predictor of human behaviour. In\nthis paper, we present a probabilistic and decision-theoretic generalisation of\nthis principle, and we demonstrate how it can be leveraged to build affectively\nintelligent artificial agents. The new model, called BayesAct, can maintain\nmultiple hypotheses about sentiments simultaneously as a probability\ndistribution, and can make use of an explicit utility function to make\nvalue-directed action choices. This allows the model to generate affectively\nintelligent interactions with people by learning about their identity,\npredicting their behaviours using the affect control principle, and taking\nactions that are simultaneously goal-directed and affect-sensitive. We\ndemonstrate this generalisation with a set of simulations.

The quasi-two-dimensional electron systems we study are confined to GaAs\nquantum wells with widths $W$ ranging from 41 to 96 nm and have variable\ndensities in the range of $\\simeq 4 \\times 10^{11}$ to $\\simeq 4 \\times\n10^{10}$ cm$^{-2}$. We present several experimental phase diagrams for the\nstability of the $\\nu=1/2$ FQHE in these quantum wells. In general, for a given\n$W$, the 1/2 FQHE is stable in a limited range of intermediate densities where\nit has a bilayer-like charge distribution; it makes a transition to a\ncompressible phase at low densities and to an insulating phase at high\ndensities. The densities at which the $\\nu=1/2$ FQHE is stable are larger for\nnarrower quantum wells. Moreover, even a slight charge distribution asymmetry\ndestabilizes the $\\nu=1/2$ FQHE and turns the electron system into a\ncompressible state. We also present a plot of the symmetric-to-antisymmetric\nsubband separation ($\\Delta_{SAS}$), which characterizes the inter-layer\ntunneling, vs density for various $W$. This plot reveals that $\\Delta_{SAS}$ at\nthe boundary between the compressible and FQHE phases increases\n\\textit{linearly} with density for all the samples. Finally, we summarize the\nexperimental data in a diagram that takes into account the relative strengths\nof the inter-layer and intra-layer Coulomb interactions and $\\Delta_{SAS}$. We\nconclude that, consistent with the conclusions of some of the previous studies,\nthe $\\nu=1/2$ FQHE observed in wide GaAs quantum wells with symmetric charge\ndistribution is stabilized by a delicate balance between the inter-layer and\nintra-layer interactions, and is very likely described by a two-component\n($\\Psi_{311}$) state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Jun 2013 05:41:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 29 Nov 2013 06:39:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-24"}

However, when D2D (in the 3rd Generation Partnership Project also\ncalled Long Term Evolution (LTE) Direct) communication in cellular spectrum is\nsupported, there is a need to revisit and modify the existing radio resource\nmanagement (RRM) and power control (PC) techniques to realize the potential of\nthe proximity and reuse gains and to limit the interference at the cellular\nlayer. In this paper, we examine the performance of the flexible LTE PC tool\nbox and benchmark it against a utility optimal iterative scheme. We find that\nthe open loop PC scheme of LTE performs well for cellular users both in terms\nof the used transmit power levels and the achieved\nsignal-to-interference-and-noise-ratio (SINR) distribution. However, the\nperformance of the D2D users as well as the overall system throughput can be\nboosted by the utility optimal scheme, because the utility maximizing scheme\ntakes better advantage of both the proximity and the reuse gains. Therefore, in\nthis paper we propose a hybrid PC scheme, in which cellular users employ the\nopen loop path compensation method of LTE, while D2D users use the utility\noptimizing distributed PC scheme. In order to protect the cellular layer, the\nhybrid scheme allows for limiting the interference caused by the D2D layer at\nthe cost of having a small impact on the performance of the D2D layer. To\nensure feasibility, we limit the number of iterations to a practically feasible\nlevel. We make the point that the hybrid scheme is not only near optimal, but\nit also allows for a distributed implementation for the D2D users, while\npreserving the LTE PC scheme for the cellular users.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Jun 2013 10:20:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-25"}

This mechanism of surface\ndiffusion is considerably more rapid than the classical model in which adsorbed\npolymers crawl on surfaces while the entire molecule remains adsorbed. The\ntrajectories with jumps follow a truncated Levy distribution of step size with\nlimiting slope -2.5, consistent with a well-defined, rapid surface diffusion\ncoefficient over the times we observe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Jun 2013 02:14:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-26"}

By using special relativity, the equivalence principle and\nthe de Broglie wavelength equation, we find that when the three rotating\nparticles have the rest masses of neutrinos or antineutrinos then surprisingly\nthe rest mass of the rotating state has the rest mass of the stable baryons,\ni.e. of the proton and the neutron.

Here, a theoretical basis is developed that\noptimizes an arbitrary number of variables for classes (i) and (ii) by the\nminimization of a function of a single variable. Algorithms that focus on a\nreduced variable set also avoid problems associated with multiple minima and\nmaxima that arise because of the large numbers of parameters. The methods\ndescribed could have applications in the physical sciences where the\noptimization of one physically significant variable has priority over the other\nvariables. For (i), we develop both an approximate but computationally more\ntractable method and an exact method where the single controlling variable k of\nall the other variables (P,k) passes through the local stationary point of the\nleast squares (LS) metric. For (ii), an exact theory is developed whereby the\noptimized function of an independent variation of all parameters coincides with\nthat due to single parameter optimization. The implicit function theorem has to\nbe further qualified to arrive at this result. The topology of the surfaces of\nconstant value of the target or cost function are considered for all the\nmethods. A real world application of the above implicit methodology to rate\nconstant and final concentration parameter determination for first and second\norder chemical reactions from published data. This work is different from and\nmore general than all the reduction schemes for conditional linear parameters\nnor is it a subset of the Adomian decomposition method (ADM) used for\nestimating solutions of differential equations, which still require boundary\nconditions that do not feature in topics (i) and (ii).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Jun 2013 18:56:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-10"}
