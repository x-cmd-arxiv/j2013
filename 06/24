Tc is an indicator of\na recent or ongoing mixing event called the third dredge-up (3DUP), and the\nnear- to mid-IR colour, such as the (K-[22]) colour where [22] is the the 22\nmicron band of the WISE space observatory, is an indicator of the dust\nmass-loss rate of a star. Methods: We collected data from the literature about\nthe Tc content, pulsation period, and near- and mid-infrared magnitudes of more\nthan 190 variable stars on the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) to which Miras\nbelong. The sample is naturally biased towards optical AGB stars, which have\nlow to intermediate (dust) mass-loss rates. Results: We show that a clear\nrelation between dust mass-loss rate and pulsation period exists if a\ndistinction is made between Tc-poor and Tc-rich Miras. Surprisingly, at a given\nperiod, Tc-poor Miras are redder in (K-[22]) than are Tc-rich Miras; i.e. they\nhave higher mass-loss rates than the Tc-rich Miras. A few stars deviate from\nthis trend; physical explanations are given for these exceptions, such as\nbinarity or high mass. Conclusions: We put forward two hypotheses to explain\nthis dichotomy and conclude that the two sequences formed by Tc-poor and\nTc-rich Miras are probably due to the different masses of the two groups. The\npulsation period has a strong correlation with the dust-mass loss rate,\nindicating that the pulsations are indeed triggering a dust-driven wind. The\nlocation in the (K-[22]) vs. period diagram can be used to distinguish between\npre- and post-3DUP Miras, which we apply to a sample of Galactic bulge AGB\nstars.

We propose that\nextrinsic adaptability, the ability given to secondary parties to change a\nsystem to match new requirements not envisioned by the primary provider, is\nsuch a trait. \"Extrinsic adaptation\" encompasses the popular concepts of\n\"workaround\", \"fast prototype extension\" or \"hack\", and extrinsic adaptability\nis thus a measure of how friendly a system is to tinkering by curious minds. In\nthis report, we give \"hackability\" or \"hacker-friendliness\" scientific\ncredentials by formulating and studying a generalization of the concept. During\nthis exercise, we find that system changes by secondary parties fall on a\nsubjective gradient of acceptability, with extrinsic adaptations on one side\nwhich confidently preserve existing system features, and invasive modifications\non the other side which are perceived to be disruptive to existing system\nfeatures. Where a change is positioned on this gradient is dependent on how an\nexternal observer perceives component boundaries within the changed system. We\nalso find that the existence of objective cost functions can alleviate but not\nfully eliminate this subjectiveness. The study also enables us to formulate an\nethical imperative for system designers to promote extrinsic adaptability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Jun 2013 17:51:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-25"}

Aims: Data acquired using the High\nDispersion Spectrograph on the Subaru telescope are re-analysed. We expect to\ndiscover new species in the atmosphere of the exoplanet HD 209458b. In addition\nto shed light on the atmospheric composition, we will derive the radial\nextension of the absorbents present in the atmosphere of the exoplanet.\nMethods: We present an alternative method to correct the telluric effects\nthrough the analysis of variations in spectral lines with the airmass.

The\nanomalous diffusion is realized via L\\'evy flights, which are characterized by\nlong-range jumps and lead to superdiffusive behavior. As a consequence, the\ncritical dimension depends continuously on the control parameter of the L\\'evy\nflight distribution. This instance is used to study the system close to the\ncritical dimension by means of the nonperturbative renormalization group\ntheory. Close to the critical dimension, the assumption of well-stirred\nreactants is violated by anticorrelations between the particles, and the law of\nmass action breaks down. The breakdown of the law of mass action is known to be\ncaused by long-range fluctuations. We identify three interrelated consequences\nof these fluctuations. First, despite being a nonuniversal quantity and thus\ndepending on the microscopic details, the renormalized reaction rate can be\napproximated by a universal law close to the critical dimension. The emergence\nof universality relies on the fact that long-range fluctuations suppress the\ninfluence of the underlying microscopic details. Second, as criticality is\napproached, the macroscopic reaction rate decreases such that the law of mass\naction loses its significance. And third, additional nonanalytic power law\ncorrections complement the analytic law of mass action term. An increasing\nnumber of those corrections accumulate and give an essential contribution as\nthe critical dimension is approached. We test our findings for two\nimplementations of L\\'evy flights that differ in the way they cross over to the\nnormal diffusion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Jun 2013 21:37:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 13 Jul 2013 13:27:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-16"}

The VW\ntransformation yields precisely the same eigenmodes and and eigenfrequencies\nthat are found with the GF method. The transformation proceeds entirely in the\nmass-normalized Cartesian coordinates of the individual atoms, with no\ntransformations to internal coordinates. The VW transformation thus offers an\nenormous computational simplification over the GF method, namely the\nmathematical apparatus needed to transform to internal coordinates is\neliminated. All need for new researchers to understand the complex matrix\ntransformations underlying the GF method is thus also removed. The VW\ntransformation is not a projection method; the internal vibrations remain\ndispersed over all 3N atomic coordinates. In the VW method, the 3N x 3N force\nconstant matrix V is replaced with a new 3N x 3N matrix W. The replacement is\nphysically transparent. The matrix W has the same internal normal modes and\nvibration frequencies that V does. However, unlike V, W is not singular, so the\nnormal modes and normal mode frequencies can be obtained using conventional\nmatrix techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Jun 2013 02:27:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-25"}

In this view,\nmultiband superconductivity would substantially differ from other systems like\nMgB2, where pairing is predominantly intraband. Indeed, interband-dominated\npairing leads to the coexistence of bonding and antibonding superconducting\nchannels. Here we show that this has profound consequences on the nature of the\nlow-energy superconducting collective modes. In particular, the so-called\nLeggett mode for phase fluctuations is absent in the usual two-band description\nof pnictides. On the other hand, when also the repulsion between the hole bands\nis taken into account, a more general three-band description should be used,\nand a Leggett mode is then allowed. Such a model, that has been proposed for\nstrongly hole-doped 122 compounds, can also admit a low-temperature s+is phase\nwhich breaks the time reversal symmetry. We show that the (quantum and thermal)\ntransition from the ordinary superconductor to the s+is state is accompanied by\nthe vanishing of the mass of Leggett-like phase fluctuations, regardless the\nspecific values of the interaction parameters. This general result can be\nobtained by means of a generalized construction of the effective action for the\ncollective degrees of freedom that allows us also to deal with the non-trivial\ncase of dominant interband pairing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Jun 2013 09:19:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Jan 2014 13:45:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-14"}

The sampling process is performed using\npivot transformations starting from a given seed conformation. Both cases of\nshort-range attractive and repulsive interactions acting on the monomers are\nconsidered. The properties of the specific energy, heat capacity and gyration\nradius of several knots are discussed. It is found that the heat capacity\nexhibits a sharp peak. If the interactions are attractive, similar peaks have\nbeen observed also in single open chains and have been related to the\ntransition from a frozen crystallite state to an expanded coil state. Some\nother peculiarities of the behavior of the analyzed observables are presented,\nlike for instance the increasing or decreasing of the knot specific energy at\nhigh temperatures with increasing polymer lengths depending if the interactions\nare attractive or repulsive.

But residual quasi-static aberrations create\nspeckles in the focal plane downstream of the coronagraph which mask the\nplanet. This problem appears in ground-based instruments as well as in\nspace-based telescopes. An active correction of these wavefront errors using a\ndeformable mirror upstream of the coronagraph is mandatory, but conventional\nadaptive optics are limited by differential path aberrations. Dedicated\ntechniques have to be implemented to measure phase and amplitude errors\ndirectly in the science focal plane. First, we propose a method for estimating\nphase and amplitude aberrations upstream of a coronagraph from the speckle\ncomplex field in the downstream focal plane. Then, we present the self-coherent\ncamera, which uses the coherence of light to spatially encode the focal plane\nspeckles and retrieve the associated complex field. This enable us to estimate\nand compensate in a closed loop for the aberrations upstream of the\ncoronagraph. We conducted numerical simulations as well as laboratory tests\nusing a four-quadrant phase mask and a 32x32 actuator deformable mirror. We\ndemonstrated in the laboratory our capability to achieve a stable closed loop\nand compensate for phase and amplitude quasi-static aberrations.

Consideration\nof only the thermal aspects of this problem leads to the familiar conclusion\nthat such grains sublimate rapidly. Here we show that charging plays a critical\nrole in determining the sublimation rate, because an electric field helps to\nbind molecules to the grain surface. A key aspect of the charging process is\nthat the conduction band of solid hydrogen lies above the vacuum free-electron\nenergy level, so low-energy electrons cannot penetrate the solid. But they are\nattracted by the dielectric and by positive ions in the matrix, so they become\ntrapped in vacuum states just above the surface. This charge-separated\nconfiguration suppresses recombination and permits overall neutrality, while\nsupporting large electric fields at the surface. Charging ceases when the\npotential energy just outside the electron layer coincides with the conduction\nband minimum. By that stage the heat of sublimation has increased tenfold,\neffecting a huge reduction in the sublimation rate. Consequently hydrogen\ngrains may be able to survive indefinitely in the diffuse ISM.

As the authors\nsuggest, it would be of interest to investigate whether a suitable\ngeneralization of standard cosmological theory could be helpful, in order to\nelucidate the observed accelerated expansion of the universe usually explained\nin terms of a positive tensile stress (negative pressure). In the present note\nwe take up this basic idea and investigate a generalization of the standard\nviscous cosmological theory, not by admitting negative temperatures but instead\nby letting the bulk viscosity take negative values. Evidently, such an approach\nbreaks standard thermodynamics, but may actually be regarded to lead to the\nsame kind of bizarre consequences as the standard approach of admitting the\nequation-of-state parameter w to be less than -1. In universe models dominated\nby negative viscosity we find that the fluid's entropy decreases with time, as\none would expect. Moreover, we find that the fluid transition from the\nquintessence region into the phantom region (thus passing the phantom divide\nw=-1) can actually be reversed. Also in generalizations of the LCDM-universe\nmodels with a fluid having negative bulk viscosity we find that the viscosity\ndecreases the expansion of the universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Jun 2013 14:03:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-01"}
