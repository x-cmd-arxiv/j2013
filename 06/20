The AMN used in\nthis work is basically auto associative. The implementation is carried out\ncompletely in 'C' language. To make the system perform to its best with minimal\ncomputation time, a Parallel algorithm is also developed using an API package\nOpenMP. Characters are mainly English alphabets (Small (26), Capital (26))\ncollected from system (52) and from different persons (52). The characters\ncollected from system are used to train the AMN and characters collected from\ndifferent persons are used for testing the recognition ability of the net. The\ndetailed analysis showed that the network recognizes the hand written\ncharacters with recognition rate of 72.20% in average case. However, in best\ncase, it recognizes the collected hand written characters with 88.5%. The\ndeveloped network consumes 3.57 sec (average) in Serial implementation and 1.16\nsec (average) in Parallel implementation using OpenMP.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Jun 2013 16:01:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-20"}

This paper focuses on the properties\nof metals at high redshift traced, in particular, by the C IV doublet\nabsorption systems. Six objects were observed with resolutions ~27 and 34 km/s\nin the visual, and 37.5 and 53.5 km/s in the near infrared. We detected 102 C\nIV lines in the range: 4.35 < z < 6.2 of which 27 are above z ~ 5. Thanks to\nthe characteristics of resolution and spectral coverage of X-shooter, we could\nalso detect 25 Si IV doublets associated with the C IV at z>5. The column\ndensity distribution function of the C IV line sample is observed to evolve in\nredshift for z>~ 5.3, with respect to the normalization defined by low redshift\n(1.5 < z <4) C IV lines. This behaviour is reflected in the redshift evolution\nof the C IV cosmic mass density, Omega_CIV, of lines with column density in the\nrange 13.4 < log N(C IV) < 15, which is consistent with a drop of a factor of\n~2 for z>~ 5.3. Considering only the stronger C IV lines (13.8 < log N(CIV) <\n15), Omega_CIV gently rises by a factor of ~10 between z ~ 6.2 and z~ 1.5 with\na possible flattening toward z ~ 0. The increase is well fitted by a power law:\nOmega_CIV = (2+-1)x10^{-8} [(1+z)/4]^{-3.1+-0.1}. An insight into the\nproperties of the C IV absorbers and their evolution with redshift is obtained\nby comparing the observed column densities of associated C IV, Si IV and C II\nabsorptions with the output of a set of CLOUDY photo-ionization models. As\nalready claimed by cosmological simulations, we find that C IV is a good tracer\nof the metallicity in the low-density intergalacitc medium gas at z ~ 5-6 while\nat z ~ 3 it arises in gas with over density delta ~100.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Jun 2013 16:28:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Aug 2013 15:14:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-30"}

These are higher dimensional analogues, both in\nthe center and hyperbolic directions, of the models studied in previous papers\nby the athors. All these models present the large gap problem.\n  We show that, for $\\epsilon$ small enough, under regularity and explicit\nnon-degeneracy conditions on the model, there are orbits whose action variables\n$I$ perform rather arbitrary excursions in a domain of size O(1). This domain\nincludes resonance lines and, hence, large gaps among $d$-dimensional KAM tori.\n  The method of proof follows closely the strategy of [DLS(=Delshams, Llave and\nSeara) 2006]. The main new phenomenon that appears when the dimension $d$ of\nthe center directions is larger than one, is the existence of multiple\nresonances. We show that, since these multiple resonances happen in sets of\ncodimension greater than one in the space of actions $I$, they can be\ncontoured. This corresponds to the mechanism called diffusion across resonances\nin the Physics literature.\n  The present paper, however, differs substantially from [DLS 2006].

We\nhave analyzed the conditions imposed on the resonances in more detail.\n  More precisely, we have found that there is a simple condition on the\nMelnikov potential which allows us to conclude that the resonances are crossed.\nIn particular, this condition does not depend on the resonances.

However, minimal rigidity does\nnot address the geometry of local mechanical stability. The jamming graph\ncontains both properties of global mechanical stability at the onset of jamming\nand local mechanical stability.

Using atomistic molecular dynamics simulations, we\nshow that 1-M TMAO and 7-M urea solutions act dramatically differently on these\nmodel polymer chains. Their behaviors are sensitive to the strength of the\nattractive dispersion interactions of the chain with its environment: when\nthese dispersion interactions are high enough, TMAO suppresses the formation of\nextended conformations of the hydrophobic polymer as compared to water, while\nurea promotes formation of extended conformations. Similar trends are observed\nexperimentally on real protein systems. Quite surprisingly, we find that both\nprotecting and denaturing osmolytes strongly interact with the polymer,\nseemingly in contrast with existing explanations of the osmolyte effect on\nproteins. We show that what really matters for a protective osmolyte is its\neffective depletion as the polymer conformation changes, which leads to a\nnegative change in the preferential binding coefficient. For TMAO, there is a\nmuch more favorable free energy of insertion of a single osmolyte near\ncollapsed conformations of the polymer than near extended conformations. By\ncontrast, urea is preferentially stabilized next to the extended conformation\nand thus has a denaturing effect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Jun 2013 18:46:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-20"}

Since the csfopde is the basic one and\nsince the Klein-Gordon equations for {\\lambda} and {\\rho} possess solutions\nthat are not solutions of the csfopde for {\\lambda} and {\\rho} we infer that it\nis legitimate to attribute to those fields mass dimension 3/2 (as is the case\nof Dirac spinor fields) and not mass dimension 1 as previously suggested in\nrecent literature (see list of references).

The properties of such\nPopulation III (Pop III) stars are thought to be very different than later\ngenerations, because cooling is dramatically different in gas with a\nmetallicity below a critical value Z_c, which lies between ~10^-6 and 10^-3\nsolar value. Z_c is much smaller than the typical average metallicity, <Z>, and\nthus the mixing efficiency of the pristine gas in the interstellar medium plays\na crucial role in the transition from Pop III to normal star formation. The\nsmall critical value, Z_c, corresponds to the far left tail of the probability\ndistribution function (PDF) of the metallicity. Based on closure models for the\nPDF formulation of turbulent mixing, we derive equations for the fraction of\ngas, P, lying below Z_c, in compressible turbulence. Our simulation data shows\nthat the evolution of the fraction P can be well approximated by a generalized\nself-convolution model, which predicts dP/dt = -n/tau_con P (1-P^(1/n)), where\nn is a measure of the locality of the PDF convolution and the timescale tau_con\nis determined by the rate at which turbulence stretches the pollutants. Using a\nsuite of simulations with Mach numbers ranging from M = 0.9 to 6.2, we provide\naccurate fits to n and tau_con as a function of M, Z_c/<Z>, and the scale, L_p,\nat which pollutants are added to the flow.

No predictive atmospheric model has\nbeen published that identifies which dynamical mechanisms determine the\natmospheric heat redistribution efficiency on tidally locked exoplanets. Here\nwe present a two-layer shallow water model of the atmospheric dynamics on\nsynchronously rotating planets that explains the observed trend. Our model\nshows that planets with weak friction and weak irradiation exhibit a banded\nzonal flow with minimal day-night temperature differences, while models with\nstrong irradiation and/or strong friction exhibit a day-night flow pattern with\norder-unity fractional day-night temperature differences. To interpret the\nmodel, we develop a scaling theory that shows that the timescale for gravity\nwaves to propagate horizontally over planetary scales, t_wave, plays a dominant\nrole in controlling the transition from small to large temperature contrasts.\nThis implies that heat redistribution is governed by a wave-like process,\nsimilar to the one responsible for the weak temperature gradients in the\nEarth's tropics. When atmospheric drag can be neglected, the transition from\nsmall to large day-night temperature contrasts occurs when t_wave ~\nsqrt(t_rad/Omega), where t_rad is the radiative relaxation time and Omega is\nthe planetary rotation frequency.

Compared to the well-studied case of\nsedimenting rigid rods, the introduction of filament compliance is shown to\ncause a significant alteration in the long-time sedimentation orientation and\nfilament geometry. A model is developed by balancing viscous, elastic, and\ngravitational forces in a slender-body theory for zero-Reynolds-number flows,\nand the filament dynamics are characterized by a dimensionless\nelasto-gravitation number. Filaments of both non-uniform and uniform\ncross-sectional thickness are considered. In the weakly flexible regime, a\nmultiple-scale asymptotic expansion is used to obtain expressions for filament\ntranslations, rotations, and shapes. These are shown to match excellently with\nfull numerical simulations. Furthermore, we show that trajectories of\nsedimenting flexible filaments, unlike their rigid counterparts, are restricted\nto a cloud whose envelope is determined by the elasto-gravitation number. In\nthe highly flexible regime we show that a filament sedimenting along its long\naxis is susceptible to a buckling instability. A linear stability analysis\nprovides a dispersion relation, illustrating clearly the competing effects of\nthe compressive stress and the restoring elastic force in the buckling process.\nThe instability travels as a wave along the filament opposite the direction of\ngravity as it grows and the predicted growth rates are shown to compare\nfavorably with numerical simulations.

Potential relationships are\ntypically explored by modeling the network as a function of the nodal\nattributes or by modeling the attributes as a function of the network. These\nmethods require specification of the exact nature of the association between\nthe network and attributes, reduce the network data to a small number of\nsummary statistics, and are unable provide predictions simultaneously for\nmissing attribute and network information. Existing methods that model the\nattributes and network jointly also assume the data are fully observed. In this\narticle we introduce a unified approach to analysis that addresses these\nshortcomings. We use a latent variable model to obtain a low dimensional\nrepresentation of the network in terms of node-specific network factors and use\na test of dependence between the network factors and attributes as a surrogate\nfor a test of dependence between the network and attributes. We propose a\nformal testing procedure to determine if dependencies exists between the\nnetwork factors and attributes. We also introduce a joint model for the network\nand attributes, for use if the test rejects, that can capture a variety of\ndependence patterns and be used to make inference and predictions for missing\nobservations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Jun 2013 22:04:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-21"}

We suggest that the commensurate-incommensurate\ntransition at y = 0.12 is due to the competition between the exchange\ninteraction and the local spin anisotropy. At low Fe dopings, the single-ion\nspin anisotropy is strong and pins the spins along the easy axis, which,\ntogether with the spatially anisotropic exchanges, induces a unusual\nbicollinear commensurate magnetic order. The low-energy spin-wave excitation is\ngapped due to the explict breaking of spin-rotational symmetry by the local\nspin anisotropy. At high Fe dopings, the single-ion anisotropy is weak, and the\nexchange favors an incommensurate coplanar state. The incommensurate magnetic\nwavevector averages out the spin anisotropy so that a gapless low-energy\nspin-wave excitation is obtained.

Strong theoretical guarantees\nhave been established concerning the embedding of a sparse signal family under\na random measurement operator and on the accuracy to which sparse signals can\nbe recovered from noisy compressive measurements. In this paper, we address\nsimilar questions in the context of a different modeling framework. Instead of\nsparse models, we focus on the broad class of manifold models, which can arise\nin both parametric and non-parametric signal families. Using tools from the\ntheory of empirical processes, we improve upon previous results concerning the\nembedding of low-dimensional manifolds under random measurement operators. We\nalso establish both deterministic and probabilistic instance-optimal bounds in\n$\\ell_2$ for manifold-based signal recovery and parameter estimation from noisy\ncompressive measurements. In line with analogous results for sparsity-based CS,\nwe conclude that much stronger bounds are possible in the probabilistic\nsetting.

From the perspective of each individual,\nhowever, it is advantageous not to volunteer such contributions, in the hope\nthat other individuals will carry the associated costs. This conflict can be\nmodeled as a volunteer's dilemma. To encourage rational individuals to make\nvoluntary contributions, a government or other social organizations can offer\nrewards, to be shared among the volunteers. Here we apply such shared rewarding\nto the generalized volunteer's dilemma, in which a threshold number of\nvolunteers is required for producing the public good. By means of theoretical\nand numerical analyses, we show that without shared rewarding only two\nevolutionary outcomes are possible: full defection or coexistence of volunteers\nand non-volunteers. We show that already small rewards destabilize full\ndefection, stabilizing small fractions of volunteers instead. Furthermore, at\nthese intermediate reward levels, we find a hysteresis effect such that\nincreasing or decreasing group sizes can trigger different social outcomes. In\nparticular, when group size is increased, the fraction of volunteers first\nincreases gradually before jumping up abruptly; when group size is then\ndecreased again, the fraction of volunteers not only remains high, but even\ncontinues to increase. As the shared reward is increased beyond a critical\nlevel, the bi-stability underlying this hysteresis effect vanishes altogether,\nand only a single social outcome remains, corresponding to the stable\ncoexistence of volunteers and non-volunteers. We find that this critical level\nof shared rewarding is relatively small compared to the total cost of\ncontributing to the public good. These results show that the introduction of\nshared rewarding is remarkably effective in overcoming defection traps in the\ngeneralized volunteer's dilemma.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Jun 2013 08:29:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 Jul 2013 13:25:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-18"}

A defining feature in such models is the involvement of at least two\nconduction channels - a slow channel that determines transitions between charge\nstates of the bridge and a fast channel that dominates its conduction. Using\nMarcus theory of heterogeneous electron transfer (ET) at metal-molecule\ninterfaces we identify and describe different regimes of nonlinear conduction\nthrough redox molecular bridges, where the transferring charge can be highly\nlocalized around the redox moiety. This localization and its stabilization by\npolarization of the surrounding medium and/or conformational changes can lead\nto decoupling of the current response dynamics from the timescale of the\nvoltage sweep (that is, the current does not adiabatically follow the voltage),\nhence to the appearance of memory (thermodynamic irreversibility) in this\nresponse that is manifested by hysteresis in current-voltage cycles. In\nstandard voltammetry such irreversibility leads to relative shift of the\ncurrent peaks along the forward and backward voltage sweeps. The common origin\nof these behaviors is pointed out and expressions of the threshold voltage\nsweep rates are provided.

To this end, a new\nnetwork-based intrusion detection system (NIDS) is proposed. Most contemporary\nNIDSs take a passive approach by solely monitoring the network's production\ntraffic. This paper explores a complementary approach in which distributed\nagents actively send out periodic probes. The probes are continuously monitored\nto detect anomalous behavior of the network. The proposed approach takes away\nmuch of the variability of the network's production traffic that makes it so\ndifficult to classify. This enables the NIDS to detect more subtle attacks\nwhich would not be detected using the passive approach alone. Furthermore, the\nactive probing approach allows the NIDS to be effectively trained using only\nexamples of the network's normal states, hence enabling an effective detection\nof zero-day attacks. Using realistic experiments, we show that an NIDS which\nalso leverages the active approach is considerably more effective in detecting\nattacks which aim to degrade the network's QoS when compared to an NIDS which\nrelies solely on the passive approach.

They\nconsist of isolated or randomly distributed circular areas devoid of any\nvegetation. They are surrounded by fringes of tall grasses and are embedded in\na sparse grassland on sandy soils. When the aridity increases, the size of the\nfairy circles increases and can reach diameters up to 10m. Although several\nhypotheses have been proposed, the origin of this phenomenon remains unsolved.\nWe show that a simple non-local model of plant ecology based on realistic\nassumptions provides a quantitative explanation of this phenomenon. Fairy\ncircles result from strong interaction between interfaces connecting two\nuniform covers: the uniform grassland and the bare states, and their\nstabilisation is attributed to the Lorentzian-like non-local coupling that\nmodels the competition between plants. The cause of their formation in thus\nrather inherent to the vegetation dynamics. Our analysis explain how a circular\nshape and fringes are formed, and how the aridity level influences the size of\nthe fairy circles. In agreement with field observation, these theoretical\nfindings, provide a link between a strong non-local interaction of plants and\nthe formation of stable fairy circles. Finally, we show that the proposed\nmechanism is model-independent: indeed, it also applies to the\nreaction-diffusion type of model that emphasises the influence of water\ntransport on the vegetation dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Jun 2013 12:26:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

However, these prior experiments have\nprimarily utilized surfactant quantities exceeding (sometimes far exceeding) a\nmonolayer.

The objective of the second player Bob is to prevent Alice from\ncreating her animal by occupying in each round a translated, reflected and/or\nrotated copy of $P$. An animal is a \\emph{cannibal} if Bob has a winning\nstrategy, and a \\emph{non-cannibal} otherwise. This paper presents some new\ntools, such as the \\emph{bounding strategy} and the \\emph{punching lemma}, to\nclassify animals into cannibals or non-cannibals.

In this work, model binary glasses are prepared in a\nprocess inspired by physical vapor deposition, in which particles are\nsequentially added to the free surface of a growing film. The resulting glasses\nare shown to be more stable than those prepared by gradual cooling from the\nliquid phase. However, it is also shown that the composition of the resulting\nglass, which is difficult to control in physical vapor deposition simulations\nof thin films, plays a significant role on the physical characteristics of the\nmaterial.

The simulations\npresented in this work, which correspond to films that are approximately 38\nmolecular diameters thick, also enable analysis of the devitrification\nmechanism of vapor-deposited glasses.

In our experiment we control\nwhether or not the source operates in the short-crystal regime through the\ndegree of pump focusing, and explicitly show how the AS and CAS measurements\ndiffer in these two regimes. Our theory provides an understanding of the\nboundary between these two regimes and also predicts the corresponding\ndiffering behaviors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Jun 2013 15:16:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-21"}

Once formed, they are robust, survive easily in the\nabsence of external disturbances and hardly decline over several Gyr, and they\nagree well with observed metallicity gradients of dwarf galaxies in the Local\nGroup. The underlying orbital displacement of stars is quite limited in our\nmodels, being of the order of only fractions of the half light radius over\ntime-spans of 5 to 10 Gyr in all star formation schemes. This is contrary to\nthe strong radial migration found in massive disc galaxies, caused by\nscattering of stars off the corotation resonance of spiral structures.

If there is a population of objects moving in\nlow-inclination, low-eccentricity orbits around the central black hole, the\nhighest probability for a close encounter with G2 is found to be in the period\n2014 January-March but enhanced activity due to encounters may start as early\nas 2013 July-August.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Jun 2013 15:58:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 4 Jul 2013 10:15:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-25"}

The periods of two clocks can be compared with each other via two\nreturn experiments. The central clock mediates between the rotating and the\ninertial frame. Dimensional arguments and a detailed deduction show that the\nperiod of a rotating clock, measured externally in the inertial system, is the\nsame as the internally defined one. There is a common synchron-time, especially\n'absolute' simultaneity and invariance of flight times hold. This allows a new\ndiscussion of the twin problem. The invariance of a rotating circle allows the\ntransference of the inertial polar coordinates to the rotating plane. The\nflight time of a light pulse obeys a generalized Fermat's principle. If rays\nare well defined, this time of flight determines the phase shift of the wave\nand the result of interference experiments.

For this reason, the concept of fractional order\nderivative should be examined. After giving different methods mostly used in\nengineering and scientific applications, the omissions or errors of these\nmethods will be discussed in this study. The mostly used methods are Euler,\nRiemann-Liouville and Caputo which are fractional order derivatives. The\napplications of these methods to constant and identity functions will be given\nin this study. Obtained results demonstrated that all of three methods have\nerrors and deficiencies. In fact, the obtained results demonstrated that the\nmethods given as fractional order derivatives are curve fitting methods or\ncurve approximation methods. In this paper, we redefined fractional order\nderivative (FOD) by using classical derivative definition and L Hospital\nmethod, since classical derivative definition concluded in indefinite limit\nsuch as 0/0. The obtained definition is same as classical derivative definition\nin case of fractional order is equal to 1.

The properties of FOD for positive monotonic increasing/decreasing\nfunctions were demonstrated in this paper. Another important point is that the\nrelation between derivatives and complex functions were also verified in this\npaper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Jun 2013 14:09:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-25"}
