Polymers can bend, twist, even become knotted.\nThus they may also display a much richer phase structure than point particles.\nBut it is not very easy to characterize the phase of a polymer. Essentially,\nthe only attribute is the radius of gyration. The way how it changes when the\ndegree of polymerization becomes different, and how it evolves when the ambient\ntemperature and solvent properties change, discloses the phase of the polymer.\nMoreover, in any finite length chain there are corrections to scaling, that\ncomplicate the detailed analysis of the phase structure. Here we introduce a\nquantity that we call the folding angle, a novel tool to identify and\nscrutinize the phases of polymers. We argue for a mean-field relationship\nbetween its values and those of the scaling exponent in the radius of gyration.\nBut unlike in the case of the radius of gyration, the value of the folding\nangle can be evaluated from a single structure.

In addition to the presence of magnetic field, the\ndifferences with neutral fluid isotropic turbulence are: weakness of\ncollisional dissipation and presence of several characteristic space and time\nscales. In this paper we discuss observational properties of solar wind\nturbulence in a large range from the MHD to the electron scales. At MHD scales,\nwithin the inertial range, turbulence cascade of magnetic fluctuations develops\nmostly in the plane perpendicular to the mean field. Solar wind turbulence is\ncompressible in nature. The spectrum of velocity fluctuations do not follow\nmagnetic field one. Probability distribution functions of different plasma\nparameters are not Gaussian, indicating presence of intermittency. At the\nmoment there is no global model taking into account all these observed\nproperties of the inertial range. At ion scales, turbulent spectra have a\nbreak, compressibility increases and the density fluctuation spectrum has a\nlocal flattening. Around ion scales, magnetic spectra are variable and ion\ninstabilities occur as a function of the local plasma parameters. Between ion\nand electron scales, a small scale turbulent cascade seems to be established.\nApproaching electron scales, the fluctuations are no more self-similar: an\nexponential cut-off is usually observed indicating an onset of dissipation. The\nnature of the small scale cascade and a possible dissipation mechanism are\nstill under debate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Jun 2013 16:56:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

The chip maker companies offer two solutions to meet the\noutput bit error rate (OBER) specification: either partial coverage with error\ncorrection code (ECC) or data storage in single level cell (SLC) with\nsignificant increase of the die cost. The NOR flash memory allows to write\ninformation in small portions, therefore the full error protection becomes\ncostly due to high required redundancy, e.g. $\\sim$50%. This is very different\nfrom the NAND flash memory writing at once large chunks of information; NAND\nECC requires just $\\sim$10% redundancy.

The theory is developed to explain coupling motions of Brownian\nparticles in the qTD confinement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Jun 2013 02:48:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Oct 2013 17:03:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-15"}

The\nsurrogate model is constructed via a regularized alternative least-square\nregression with Tikhonov regularization using a roughening matrix computing the\ngradient of the solution, in conjunction with a perturbation-based error\nindicator to detect optimal model complexities. The model approximates a vector\nof a continuous solution at discrete values of a physical variable. The\nrequired number of random realizations to achieve a successful approximation\nlinearly depends on the function dimensionality. The computational cost of the\nmodel construction is quadratic in the number of random inputs, which\npotentially tackles the curse of dimensionality in high-dimensional stochastic\nfunctions. Furthermore, this vector valued separated representation-based\nmodel, in comparison to the available scalar-valued case, leads to a\nsignificant reduction in the cost of approximation by an order of magnitude\nequal to the vector size. The performance of the method is studied through its\napplication to three numerical examples including a 41-dimensional elliptic PDE\nand a 21-dimensional cavity flow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Jun 2013 05:09:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-25"}

Although some\nremarkable success has been achieved, the empirical correlations thus found are\nstill affected by a significant intrinsic scatter which downgrades the\nprecision in the inferred GRBs Hubble diagram. We investigate here whether this\nscatter may come from fitting together objects belonging to intrinsically\ndifferent classes.

Although\nthe poor statistics prevent us from drawing a definitive answer, we find that\nboth the intrinsic scatter and the coefficients of the $E_{peak}$\\,-\\,$E_{iso}$\nand $E_{peak}$\\,-\\,$L$ correlations significantly change depending on which\nsubsample is fitted.

The study is part of an analysis of the line survey\ndivided into families of molecules. Our aim is to derive accurate physical\nconditions and molecular abundances in the different components of Orion KL\nfrom observed SO and SO2 lines. First we assumed LTE conditions obtain\nrotational temperatures. We then used a radiative transfer model, assuming\neither LVG or LTE excitation to derive column densities of these molecules in\nthe different components of Orion KL. We have detected 68 lines of SO, 34SO,\n33SO, and S18O and 653 lines of SO2, 34SO2, 33SO2, SO18O and SO2 v2=1. We\nprovide column densities for all of them and also upper limits for the column\ndensities of S17O, 36SO, 34S18O, SO17O and 34SO2 v2=1 and for several\nundetected sulfur-bearing species. In addition, we present 2'x2' maps around\nOrion IRc2 of SO2 transitions with energies from 19 to 131 K and also maps with\nfour transitions of SO, 34SO and 34SO2. We observe an elongation of the gas\nalong the NE-SW direction. An unexpected emission peak appears at 20.5 km/s in\nmost lines of SO and SO2. A study of the spatial distribution of this emission\nfeature shows that it is a new component ~5\" in diameter, which lies ~4\" west\nof IRc2. We suggest the emission from this feature is related to shocks\nassociated to the BN object. The highest column densities for SO and SO2 are\nfound in the high-velocity plateau (a region dominated by shocks) and in the\nhot core. These values are up to three orders of magnitude higher than the\nresults for the ridge components. We also find high column densities for their\nisotopologues in both components. Therefore, we conclude that SO and SO2 are\ngood tracers, not only of regions affected by shocks, but also of regions with\nwarm dense gas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Jun 2013 13:45:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

We\nhere discuss the few points which remain under dispute. First, the inevitable\ndecay of tachyonic scalars really does result in their 2-point functions\nbreaking de Sitter invariance. This is obscured by analytic continuation\ntechniques which produce formal solutions to the propagator equation that are\nnot propagators. Second, Morrison's de Sitter invariant solution for the spin\ntwo sector of the graviton propagator involves derivatives of the scalar\npropagator at $M^2 = 0$, where it is not meromorphic unless de Sitter breaking\nis permitted. Third, de Sitter breaking does not require zero modes. Fourth,\nthe ambiguity Morrison claims in the equation for the spin two structure\nfunction is fixed by requiring it to derive from a mode sum. Fifth, Morrison's\nspin two sector is not \"physically equivalent\" to ours because their\ncoincidence limits differ. Finally, it is only the noninvariant propagator that\ngets the time independence and scale invariance of the tensor power spectrum\ncorrectly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Jun 2013 14:03:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 May 2014 07:43:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-09"}

Explicit formulas for the graded parafermionic partition functions\nare obtained, and the inverse of the graded partition function (IGPPF), turns\nout to be bosonic (fermionic) partition function depending on the parity of the\norder $s$ of the parafermions. It is also shown that these partition functions\nare generating functions of partitions of integers with restrictions. If the\nparity of the order $s$ is even, then mixing a system of parafermions with a\nsystem whose partition function is (IGPPF), results in a system of fermions and\nbosons. On the other hand, if the parity of $s$ is odd, then, the system we\nobtain is still a mixture of fermions and bosons but the corresponding Fock\nspace of states is truncated. It turns out that these partition functions are\ngiven in terms of the Jacobi theta function $\\theta_{4}$, and generate\nsequences in partition theory. Our partition functions coincide with the\noverpartitions, and jagged partitions in conformal field theory.

The different\npartition functions for the Riemann gas that are the counter parts of the Euler\ngas are obtained by a simple change of variables.
