Our\nzero-field muSR spectra clearly reveal coherent two-frequency oscillations at\nlow temperature in x=0, 0.3 and 0.5 samples, which confirms the long-range\nmagnetic ordering of the Ce-moment with TN=27, 26 and 21 K respectively. On the\nother hand the muSR spectra of x=0.8 and x=1 down to 1.4 K and 0.045 K,\nrespectively exhibit a temperature independent Kubo-Toyabe term confirming a\nparamagnetic ground state. The long-range magnetic ordering in x=0.5 below 21 K\nhas been confirmed through the neutron diffraction study. INS measurements of\nx=0 clearly reveal the presence of a sharp inelastic excitation near 8 meV\nbetween 5 K and 26 K, due to an opening of a gap in the spin excitation\nspectrum, which transforms into a broad response at and above 30 K.\nInterestingly, at 4.5 K the spin gap excitation broadens in x=0.3 and exhibits\ntwo clear peaks at 8.4(3) and 12.0(5) meV in x=0.5. In the x=0.8 sample, which\nremains paramagnetic down to 1.2 K, there is a clear signature of a spin gap of\n10-12 meV at 7 K, with a strong Q-dependent intensity. Evidence of a spin gap\nof 12.5(5) meV has also been found in x=1. The observation of a spin gap in the\nparamagnetic samples (x=0.8 and 1) is an interesting finding in this study and\nit challenges our understanding of the origin of the semiconducting gap in\nCeT2Al10 (T=Ru and Os) compounds in terms of hybridization gap opening only a\nsmall part of the Fermi surface, gapped spin waves, or a spin-dimer gap.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Jun 2013 16:04:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

We use the flux-conservative Athena\ncode to conduct a series of experiments on disks having a variety of magnetic\ntopologies to determine what constitutes adequate resolution. We develop and\napply several resolution metrics: Qz and Qphi, the ratio of the grid zone size\nto the characteristic MRI wavelength, alpha_mag, the ratio of the Maxwell\nstress to the magnetic pressure, and the ratio of radial to toroidal magnetic\nfield energy. For the initial conditions considered here, adequate resolution\nis characterized by Qz > 15, Qphi > 20, alpha_mag = 0.45, and a field energy\nratio of 0.2. These values are associated with > 35 zones per scaleheight, a\nresult consistent with shearing box simulations. Numerical algorithm is also\nimportant. Use of the HLLE flux solver or second-order interpolation can\nsignificantly degrade the effective resolution compared to the HLLD flux solver\nand third-order interpolation. Resolution at this standard can be achieved only\nwith large numbers of grid zones, arranged in a fashion that matches the\nsymmetries of the problem and the scientific goals of the simulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Jun 2013 19:22:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

If geographically-nearby users directly adopt WiFi or Bluetooth\ntechnology (i.e., leveraging proximity-based communication) for information\nspreading in MSNets, a portion of mobile traffic can be offloaded from cellular\nnetworks. For many delay-tolerant applications, it is beneficial for traffic\noffloading to pick some seed users as information sources, which help further\nspread the information to others in an epidemic-like manner using\nproximity-based communication. In this paper, we develop a theoretical\nframework to study the issue of choosing only k seed users so as to maximize\nthe mobile traffic offloaded from cellular networks via proximity-based\ncommunication. We introduce a gossip-style social cascade (GSC) model to model\nthe information diffusion process, which captures the epidemic-like nature of\nproximity-based communication and characterizes users' social participation as\nwell. For static networks as a special-case study and mobile networks, we\nestablish an equivalent view and a temporal mapping of the information\ndiffusion process, respectively, leveraging virtual coupon collectors.

The high S/N of our spectra allow us to break various\ndegeneracies that arise from different combinations of models, varying\nmetallicities, and contamination from QSO light. We find that none of the host\nspectra can be modeled by purely old stellar populations and that the majority\nof the hosts (14/15) have a substantial contribution from intermediate-age\npopulations with ages ranging from 0.7 to 2.4 Gyr.

However,\nthe resultant integrands of the PCT tend to become nearly singular when (1) the\naspect ratio of the element is large or (2) the field point is closed to the\nelement boundary; thus a large number of quadrature points are needed to\nachieve a relatively high accuracy. In this paper, the first problem is\ncircumvented by using a conformal transformation so that the geometry of the\ncurved physical element is preserved in the transformed domain. The second\nproblem is alleviated by using a sigmoidal transformation, which makes the\nquadrature points more concentrated around the near singularity.\n  By combining the proposed two transformations with the Guiggiani's method in\n[M.

The interferometric observations\nallow measuring the relative positions of the binary components and their\nrelative brightness. The data collected over the full orbital period allows all\nseven orbital elements to be determined. In addition to the interferometric\nobservations, we analyzed archival spectra obtained at the Calar Alto, Haute\nProvence, Cerro Armazones, and La Silla observatories, as well as new spectra\nobtained at the VLT on Cerro Paranal.

In a swarming session, a file is\ndistributed to all the receivers by having all the nodes in the session\nexchange file chunks. By universal swarming, not only all the nodes in the\nsession, but also some nodes outside the session may participate in the chunk\nexchange to improve the distribution performance. We present a universal\nswarming model where the chunks are distributed along different Steiner trees\nrooted at the source and covering all the receivers. We assume chunks arrive\ndynamically at the sources and focus on finding stable universal swarming\nalgorithms. To achieve the throughput region, universal swarming usually\ninvolves a tree-selection subproblem of finding a min-cost Steiner tree, which\nis NP-hard. We propose a universal swarming scheme that employs an approximate\ntree-selection algorithm.

In this note we examine\nthe prediction of holographic RG in de Sitter space for the flow of double and\ntriple trace couplings in any proposed dual. We show quite generally that the\ncorrect form of the field theory beta functions for the double trace couplings\nis obtained from holography, provided one identifies the scale of the field\ntheory with (i|T|) where T is the `time' in conformal coordinates. For dS(4),\nwe find that with an appropriate choice of operator normalization, it is\npossible to have real n-point correlation functions as well as beta functions\nwith real coefficients. This choice leads to an RG flow with an IR fixed point\nat negative coupling unlike in a unitary theory where the IR fixed point is at\npositive coupling. The proposed correspondence of Sp(N) vector models with de\nSitter Vasiliev gravity provides a specific example of such a phenomenon. For\ndS(d+1) with even d, however, we find that no choice of operator normalization\nexists which ensures reality of coefficients of the beta-functions as well as\nabsence of n-dependent phases for various n-point functions, as long as one\nassumes real coupling constants in the bulk Lagrangian.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Jun 2013 09:14:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 25 Aug 2013 08:16:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

However, it causes different problems such as overuse of oil,\ntraffic jams causing earth pollution, health problems and an inefficient use of\npersonal time. One possible solution to these problems is carpooling, i.e.\nsharing a trip on a private car of a driver with one or more passengers.\nCarpooling would reduce the number of cars on streets hence providing worldwide\nenvironmental, economical and social benefits. The matching of drivers and\npassengers can be facilitated by information and communication technologies.\nTypically, a driver inserts on a web-site the availability of empty seats on\nhis/her car for a planned trip and potential passengers can search for trips\nand contact the drivers. This process is slow and can be appropriate for long\ntrips planned days in advance. We call this static carpooling and we note it is\nnot used frequently by people even if there are already many web-sites offering\nthis service and in fact the only real open challenge is widespread adoption.\nDynamic carpooling, on the other hand, takes advantage of the recent and\nincreasing adoption of Internet-connected geo-aware mobile devices for enabling\nimpromptu trip opportunities. Passengers request trips directly on the street\nand can find a suitable ride in just few minutes. Currently there are no\ndynamic carpooling systems widely used. Every attempt to create and organize\nsuch systems failed. This paper reviews the state of the art of dynamic\ncarpooling. It identifies the most important issues against the adoption of\ndynamic carpooling systems and the proposed solutions for such issues. It\nproposes a first input on solving the problem of mass-adopting dynamic\ncarpooling systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Jun 2013 11:32:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-04"}

The young object HD200775 (MWC361) is a massive spectroscopic\nbinary (separation of ~15.9mas, ~5.0~AU), with uncertain classification\n(early/late Be), that shows a strong and variable Halpha emission. We aim to\nstudy the mechanisms that produce the Halpha line at the AU-scale. Combining\nthe radial velocity measurements and astrometric data available in the\nliterature, we determined new orbital parameters. With the VEGA instrument on\nthe CHARA array, we spatially and spectrally resolved the Halpha emission of\nHD200775, at low and medium spectral resolutions (R~1600 and 5000) over a full\norbital period (~3.6 years). We observe that the Halpha equivalent width varies\nwith the orbital phase, and increases close to periastron, as expected from\ntheoretical models that predict an increase of the mass transfer from the\ncircumbinary disk to the primary disk. In addition, using spectral visibilities\nand differential phases, we find marginal variations of the typical extent of\nthe Halpha emission (at 1 to 2-sigma level) and location (at 1 to 5-sigma\nlevel). The spatial extent of the Halpha emission, as probed by a Gaussian\nFWHM, is minimum at the ascending node (0.67+/-0.20 mas, i.e., 0.22+/-0.06 AU),\nand more than doubles at periastron. In addition, the Gaussian photocenter is\nslightly displaced in the direction opposite to the secondary, ruling out the\nscenario in which all or most of the Halpha emission is due to accretion onto\nthe secondary. These findings, together with the wide Halpha line profile, may\nbe due to a non-spherical wind enhanced at periastron.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Jun 2013 13:09:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

In the InGaAs/GaAs dots this nuclear spin polarization\nmechanism is particularly pronounced, resulting in Overhauser shifts up to ~80\nmicro-eV achieved at optical excitation power ~1000 times smaller than the\npower required to saturate ground state excitons. The Overhauser shifts\nobserved at low-power optical pumping in the interface GaAs/AlGaAs dots are\ngenerally found to be smaller (up to ~40 micro-eV). Furthermore in GaAs/AlGaAs\nwe observe dot-to-dot variation and even sign reversal of the Overhauser shift\nwhich is attributed to dark-bright exciton mixing originating from\nelectron-hole exchange interaction in dots with reduced symmetry. Nuclear spin\npolarization degrees reported in this work under ultra-low power optical\npumping are comparable to those achieved by techniques such as resonant optical\npumping or above-gap pumping with high power circularly polarized light.\nDynamic nuclear polarization via second-order recombination of ''dark''\nexcitons may become a useful tool in single quantum dot applications, where\nmanipulation of the nuclear spin environment or electron spin is required.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Jun 2013 15:48:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-10"}
