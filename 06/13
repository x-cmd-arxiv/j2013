How is the intrinsic\nflexibility required for these motions encoded in their three-dimensional\nstructures? Here, the overall flexibility of a protein is demonstrated to be\ntightly coupled to the total amount of surface area buried within its fold. A\nsimple proxy for this, the relative solvent accessible surface area (Arel),\ntherefore shows excellent agreement with independent measures of global protein\nflexibility derived from various experimental and computational methods.\nApplication of Arel on a large scale demonstrates its utility by revealing\nunique sequence and structural properties associated with intrinsic\nflexibility. In particular, flexibility as measured by Arel shows little\ncorrespondence with intrinsic disorder, but instead tends to be associated with\nmultiple domains and increased {\\alpha}- helical structure. Furthermore, the\napparent flexibility of monomeric proteins is found to be useful for\nidentifying quaternary structure errors in published crystal structures. There\nis also a strong tendency for the crystal structures of more flexible proteins\nto be solved to lower resolutions. Finally, local solvent accessibility is\nshown to be a primary determinant of local residue flexibility. Overall this\nwork provides both fundamental mechanistic insight into the origin of protein\nflexibility and a simple, practical method for predicting flexibility from\nprotein structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Jun 2013 16:02:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Aug 2013 17:09:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-14"}

We present a complete and practical numerical\nalgorithm for solving the dual problem in one-dimensional, slab geometries. The\nclosure is only well-defined on the set of moments that are realizable from a\npositive underlying distribution, and as the boundary of the realizable set is\napproached, the dual problem becomes increasingly difficult to solve due to\nill-conditioning of the Hessian matrix. To improve the condition number of the\nHessian, we advocate the use of a change of polynomial basis, defined using a\nCholesky factorization of the Hessian, that permits solution of problems nearer\nto the boundary of the realizable set. We also advocate a fixed quadrature\nscheme, rather than adaptive quadrature, since the latter introduces\nunnecessary expense and changes the computationally realizable set as the\nquadrature changes. For very ill-conditioned problems, we use regularization to\nmake the optimization algorithm robust. We design a manufactured solution and\ndemonstrate that the adaptive-basis optimization algorithm reduces the need for\nregularization. This is important since we also show that regularization slows,\nand even stalls, convergence of the numerical simulation when refining the\nspace-time mesh. We also simulate two well-known benchmark problems. There we\nfind that our adaptive-basis, fixed-quadrature algorithm uses less\nregularization than alternatives, although differences in the resulting\nnumerical simulations are more sensitive to the regularization strategy than to\nthe choice of basis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Jun 2013 16:28:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

Here\nwe contrast network properties derived from diffusion spectrum imaging data of\nthe human brain with 13 synthetic network models chosen to probe the roles of\nphysical network embedding and temporal network growth. We characterize both\nthe empirical and synthetic networks using familiar diagnostics presented in\nstatistical form, as scatter plots and distributions, to reveal the full range\nof variability of each measure across scales in the network. We focus on the\ndegree distribution, degree assortativity, hierarchy, topological Rentian\nscaling, and topological fractal scaling---in addition to several summary\nstatistics, including the mean clustering coefficient, shortest path length,\nand network diameter. The models are investigated in a progressive, branching\nsequence, aimed at capturing different elements thought to be important in the\nbrain, and range from simple random and regular networks, to models that\nincorporate specific growth rules and constraints. We find that synthetic\nmodels that constrain the network nodes to be embedded in anatomical brain\nregions tend to produce distributions that are similar to those extracted from\nthe brain. We also find that network models hardcoded to display one network\nproperty do not in general also display a second, suggesting that multiple\nneurobiological mechanisms might be at play in the development of human brain\nnetwork architecture. Together, the network models that we develop and employ\nprovide a potentially useful starting point for the statistical inference of\nbrain network structure from neuroimaging data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Jun 2013 16:56:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

A rich absorption complex is detected in the Fe L band, including\ndensity-sensitive lines from Fe XX, XXI, and XXII. Spectral analysis over three\nbands with photoionization models generally requires a gas density of n > 1\nE+17 cm^-3. Assuming a luminosity of L = 1 E+37 erg/s, fits to the 10-14 A band\nconstrain the absorbing gas to lie within r = 3.9(7) E+3 km from the central\nengine, or about r = 520 +/- 90 (M/5 Msun) r_g, where r_g = GM/c^2.

The\noptimized perturbation theory (OPT) is used to obtain results going beyond the\nlarge-N approximation. The free energy and the complete phase diagram of the\nmodel, in terms of temperature, chemical potential and magnetic field are\nobtained and studied in details. By comparing the results from the OPT and the\nlarge-N approximation, we conclude that finite N effects favor the phenomenon\nof inverse magnetic catalysis when the coupling constant is negative. We show\nthat with the OPT the value of the coexistence chemical potential at vanishing\ntemperature always decreases with the magnetic field. This is opposite to what\nis seen in the large-N approximation, where for large magnetic fields the\ncoexistence chemical potential starts again to increase. Likewise, at finite\ntemperature, the value of the chemical potential at the tricritical point also\ndecreases with the magnetic field in the OPT case. Consequently, the shape of\nthe phase diagrams predicted by the OPT and by the large-N approximation look\nvery different in the presence of high magnetic fields. Finally, for small\nvalues of magnetic field and temperature, we identify the presence of possible\nintermediate nonchiral phase transitions when varying the chemical potential.\nWe show that these phenomena are not an artifact of the large-N approximation\nand that they also occur within the OPT framework. These intermediate\ntransitions are interpreted to be a consequence of the de Haas--van Alphen\noscillations.

Several approaches have been proposed to address this issue,\nincluding the recent promising work which incorporate Bayesian Nonparametrics\ninto the $k$-means clustering procedure. This approach shows simplicity in\nimplementation and solidity in theory, while it also provides a feasible way to\ninference in large scale datasets. However, several problems remains unsolved\nin this pioneering work, including the power-law data applicability, mechanism\nto merge centers to avoid the over-fitting problem, clustering order problem,\ne.t.c.. To address these issues, the Pitman-Yor Process based k-means (namely\n\\emph{pyp-means}) is proposed in this paper. Taking advantage of the Pitman-Yor\nProcess, \\emph{pyp-means} treats clusters differently by dynamically and\nadaptively changing the threshold to guarantee the generation of power-law\nclustering results. Also, one center agglomeration procedure is integrated into\nthe implementation to be able to merge small but close clusters and then\nadaptively determine the cluster number. With more discussion on the clustering\norder, the convergence proof, complexity analysis and extension to spectral\nclustering, our approach is compared with traditional clustering algorithm and\nvariational inference methods. The advantages and properties of pyp-means are\nvalidated by experiments on both synthetic datasets and real world datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Jun 2013 01:20:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-14"}

Ionization plays a central role in the gas-phase chemistry of\nmolecular clouds. Since ions are coupled with magnetic fields, which can in\nturn counteract gravitational collapse, it is of paramount importance to\nmeasure their abundance in star-forming regions. Aims. We use spectral line\nobservations of the high-mass star-forming region NGC 6334 I to derive the\nabundance of two of the most abundant molecular ions, HCO+ and N2H+, and\nconsequently, the cosmic ray ionization rate.

This raises questions regarding\nthe optimal investment of this time and money for future surveys. In a previous\nwork, it was shown that a sparse sampling strategy could be a powerful\nsubstitute for the contiguous observations. However, in this previous paper a\nregular sparse sampling was investigated, where the sparse observed patches\nwere regularly distributed on the sky. The regularity of the mask introduces a\nperiodic pattern in the window function, which induces periodic correlations at\nspecific scales. In this paper, we use the Bayesian experimental design to\ninvestigate a random sparse sampling, where the observed patches are randomly\ndistributed over the total sparsely sampled area. We find that, as there is no\npreferred scale in the window function, the induced correlation is evenly\ndistributed amongst all scales. This could be desirable if we are interested in\nspecific scales in the galaxy power spectrum, such as the Baryonic Acoustic\nOscillation (BAO) scales. However, for constraining the overall galaxy power\nspectrum and the cosmological parameters, there is no preference over regular\nor random sampling. Hence any approach that is practically more suitable can be\nchosen and we can relax the regular-grid condition for the distribution of the\nobserved patches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Jun 2013 06:41:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-23"}

We recently reported on a new implementation of CAD in\nMaple which implemented the original algorithm of Collins and the subsequent\nimprovement to projection by McCallum. Our implementation was in contrast to\nMaple's in-built CAD command, based on a quite separate theory. Although\ninitially developed as an investigative tool to compare the algorithms, we\nfound and reported that our code offered functionality not currently available\nin any other existing implementations. One particularly important piece of\nfunctionality is the ability to produce order-invariant CADs. This has allowed\nus to extend the implementation to produce CADs invariant with respect to\neither equational constraints (ECCADs) or the truth-tables of sequences of\nformulae (TTICADs). This new functionality is contained in the second release\nof our code, along with commands to consider problem formulation which can be a\nmajor factor in the tractability of a CAD. In the report we describe the new\nfunctionality and some theoretical discoveries it prompted. We describe how the\nCADs produced using equational constraints are able to take advantage of not\njust improved projection but also improvements in the lifting phase.

We unify these seemingly different theoretical frameworks by\nanalysing the standard model of cosmology from first principles within quantum\nfield theory on curved spacetime: assuming that the universe is homogeneous and\nisotropic on large scales, we specify a class of quantum states whose\nexpectation value of the energy density is qualitatively and quantitatively of\nthe standard perfect fluid form up to potential corrections.

In our work we\nwant to describe the interactions between two groups of different ant species\nwith different war strategies. Our model considers the single ant individuals\nand fighting groups in a way similar to atoms and molecules, respectively,\nconsidering that ant fighting groups remain stable for a relative long time.\nStarting from a system of differential non-linear equations (DE), derived from\nthe chemical reactions, we obtain a mean field description of the system. The\nDE approach is valid when the number of individuals of each species is large in\nthe considered unit, while we consider battles of at most 10 vs. 10\nindividuals, due to the difficulties in following the individual behavior in a\nlarge assembly. Therefore, we also adapt a Gillespie algorithm to reproduce the\nfluctuations around the mean field. The DE scheme is exploited to characterize\nthe stochastic model. The set of parameters of chemical equations, obtained\nusing a minimization algorithm, are used by the Gillespie algorithm to generate\nthe stochastic trajectories. We then fit the stochastic paths with the DE, in\norder to analyze the variability of the parameters and their variance. Finally,\nwe estimate the goodness of the applied methodology and we confirm that the\nstochastic approach must be considered for a correct description of the ant\nfighting dynamics. With respect to other war models, our chemical one considers\nall phases of the battle and not only casualties. Thus, we can count on more\nexperimental data, but we also have more parameters to fit.

We devise novel scheduling schemes in which the\ntradeoff between the users' ergodic capacities and their average amount of\nharvested energy can be controlled. To this end, we modify two fair scheduling\nschemes used in information-only transfer systems. First, proportionally fair\nmaximum normalized signal-to-noise ratio (N-SNR) scheduling is modified by\nscheduling the user having the jth ascendingly ordered (rather than the\nmaximum) N-SNR. We refer to this scheme as order-based N-SNR scheduling.\nSecond, conventional equal-throughput (ET) fair scheduling is modified by\nscheduling the user having the minimum moving average throughput among the set\nof users whose N-SNR orders fall into a certain set of allowed orders Sa\n(rather than the set of all users). We refer to this scheme as order-based ET\nscheduling. The feasibility conditions required for the users to achieve ET\nwith this scheme are also derived. We show that the smaller the selection order\nj for the order-based N-SNR scheme, and the lower the orders in Sa for the\norder-based ET scheme, the higher the average amount of energy harvested by the\nusers at the expense of a reduction in their ergodic capacities. We analyze the\nperformance of the considered scheduling schemes for independent and\nnon-identically distributed (i.n.d.) Ricean fading channels, and provide\nclosed-form results for the special case of i.n.d. Rayleigh fading.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Jun 2013 12:16:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 Sep 2013 15:05:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-01"}

We present the sample and first results from the\nExtended GMRT Radio Halo Survey (EGRHS)- an extension of the GMRT Radio Halo\nSurvey (GRHS, Venturi et al. 2007, 2008). It is a systematic radio survey of\ngalaxy clusters selected from the REFLEX and eBCS X-ray catalogs . Analysis of\nGMRT data at 610/ 235/ 325 MHz on 12 galaxy clusters are presented. We report\nthe detection of a newly discovered mini-halo in the cluster RXJ1532.9+3021 at\n610 MHz. A small scale relic (~200 kpc) is suspected in the cluster Z348. We do\nnot detect cluster-scale diffuse emission in 11 clusters. Robust upper limits\non the detection of radio halo of size of 1 Mpc are determined. We also present\nupper limits on the detections of mini-halos in a sub-sample of cool-core\nclusters. The upper limits for radio halos and mini-halos are plotted in the\nradio power- X-ray luminosity plane and the correlations are discussed. Diffuse\nextended emission, not related to the target clusters, but detected as\nby-products in the sensitive images of two of the cluster fields (A689 and\nRXJ0439.0+0715) are reported. Based on the information about the presence of\nradio halos (or upper limits), available on 48 clusters out of the total sample\nof 67 clusters (EGRHS+GRHS), we find that ~23% of the clusters host radio\nhalos. The radio halo fraction rises to ~31%, when only the clusters with X-ray\nluminosities >8x10^44 erg/s are considered. Mini-halos are found in ~50 % of\ncool-core clusters. A qualitative examination of the X-ray images of the\nclusters with no diffuse radio emission indicates that a majority of these\nclusters do not show extreme dynamical disturbances and supports the idea that\nmergers play an important role in the generation of radio halos/relics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Jun 2013 13:19:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

Among all of\nthem, we chose three on which we contributed personally. Our first example\nrelates Kolmogorov-Smirnov like goodness-of-fit tests, modified in such a way\nthat tail events and core events contribute equally to the test (in the\nstandard Kolmogorov-Smirnov, the tails contribute very little to the measure of\ngoodness-of-fit). We show that this problem can be mapped onto that of a random\nwalk inside moving walls. The second example is the optimal time to sell an\nasset (modelled as a random walk with drift) such that the sell time is as\nclose as possible to the time at which the asset reaches its maximum value.

Also\nknown as Welch-bound-equality sequences, such frames arise in various\napplications, such as waveform design and compressed sensing. At the moment,\nthere are only two known flexible methods for constructing ETFs: harmonic ETFs\nare formed by carefully extracting rows from a discrete Fourier transform;\nSteiner ETFs arise from a tensor-like combination of a combinatorial design and\na regular simplex. These two classes seem very different: the vectors in\nharmonic ETFs have constant amplitude, whereas Steiner ETFs are extremely\nsparse. We show that they are actually intimately connected: a large class of\nSteiner ETFs can be unitarily transformed into constant-amplitude frames,\ndubbed Kirkman ETFs. Moreover, we show that an important class of harmonic ETFs\nis a subset of an important class of Kirkman ETFs. This connection informs the\ndiscussion of both types of frames: some Steiner ETFs can be transformed into\nconstant-amplitude waveforms making them more useful in waveform design; some\nharmonic ETFs have low spark, making them less desirable for compressed\nsensing. We conclude by showing that real-valued constant-amplitude ETFs are\nequivalent to binary codes that achieve the Grey-Rankin bound, and then\nconstruct such codes using Kirkman ETFs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Jun 2013 14:06:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-14"}

By evaluating the time series of local measurements, the local traffic\nstates are assigned to the different traffic phases of Kerner's three-phase\ntraffic theory. For this classification we use the rule-based FOTO-method,\nwhich provides `hard' rules for this assignment. Using this approach, our\nanalysis shows that the model is indeed able to reproduce three qualitatively\ndifferent traffic phases: free flow (F), synchronized traffic (S), and wide\nmoving jams (J). In addition, we investigate the likelihood of transitions\nbetween the three traffic phases. We show that a transition from free flow (F)\nto a wide moving jam (J) often involves an intermediate transition; first from\nfree flow F to synchronized flow S and then from synchronized flow to a wide\nmoving jam. This is supported by the fact that the so called F->S transition\n(from free flow to synchronized traffic) is much more likely than a direct F->J\ntransition.\n  The model under consideration has a functional relation between traffic flow\nand traffic density. The fundamental hypothesis of the three-phase traffic\ntheory, however, postulates that the steady states of synchronized flow occupy\na two-dimensional region in the flow-density plane.

The previously\npublished work is as follows.\n  The optimally natural Higgs-stop sector in the MSSM in light of the 2012\ndiscovery of a Higgs boson is derived, namely that of almost maximal mixing,\nwith the scalar top partners almost as light as can be. The discovery is also\ninterpreted numerically in the NMSSM, with greater emphasis placed on the\nvisibility of the Higgs boson at the observed mass, i.e. on signal strengths. I\ninvestigate the role played by the mediation scale of GMSB: this is found to be\nas a control of the extent to which Yukawa couplings de-tune flavour-blind\nrelations set by gauge couplings. Finally, issues relating to the discovery or\nexclusion of Susy at colliders are discussed. Bounds are derived for the masses\nof new particles from LHC searches for excesses of jets and missing energy\nwithout leptons, and compared to constraints arising from Higgs boson searches,\nfor models of GMSB and the Constrained Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model. I\npresent a novel search strategy for new physics signatures with two neutral,\nstable particles, when such particles are produced by boosted decays. (Susy\nmotivations include models with light gravitinos, pseudo-goldstinos, singlinos\nor new photinos.) The method is shown to produce sharp mass peaks that enhance\nthe visibility of the signal, with mass reconstruction to 5% from O(100)\nevents.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Jun 2013 14:24:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-14"}

In this paper, we study the role of a few\nvigilante players who also defect from a cooperative resource-sharing protocol\nbut only in response to perceived greedy behavior. For a simple model of\nengagement, we demonstrate surprisingly complex dynamics among greedy and\nvigilante players.

To study this property, we\nformulate an exact representation for the greedy player best response function\nin the case when there is one greedy player, one vigilante player and $N-2$\ncooperative players. We use this formulation to show conditions under which a\nNash equilibrium exists.

The theory\naims to simplify and integrate concepts across artificial intelligence,\nmainstream computing and human perception and cognition, with information\ncompression as a unifying theme. It is conceived as a brain-like system that\nreceives 'New' information and stores some or all of it in compressed form as\n'Old' information. It is realised in the form of a computer model -- a first\nversion of the SP machine. The concept of \"multiple alignment\" is a powerful\ncentral idea. Using heuristic techniques, the system builds multiple alignments\nthat are 'good' in terms of information compression. For each multiple\nalignment, probabilities may be calculated. These provide the basis for\ncalculating the probabilities of inferences. The system learns new structures\nfrom partial matches between patterns. Using heuristic techniques, the system\nsearches for sets of structures that are 'good' in terms of information\ncompression. These are normally ones that people judge to be 'natural', in\naccordance with the 'DONSVIC' principle -- the discovery of natural structures\nvia information compression. The SP theory may be applied in several areas\nincluding 'computing', aspects of mathematics and logic, representation of\nknowledge, natural language processing, pattern recognition, several kinds of\nreasoning, information storage and retrieval, planning and problem solving,\ninformation compression, neuroscience, and human perception and cognition.\nExamples include the parsing and production of language including discontinuous\ndependencies in syntax, pattern recognition at multiple levels of abstraction\nand its integration with part-whole relations, nonmonotonic reasoning and\nreasoning with default values, reasoning in Bayesian networks including\n'explaining away', causal diagnosis, and the solving of a geometric analogy\nproblem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Jun 2013 11:51:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Jul 2013 16:31:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 8 Sep 2013 12:16:05 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 7 Jan 2015 11:44:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-08"}
