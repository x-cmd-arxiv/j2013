The problem is\nexacerbated by the difficulty of selecting the proper modulation and coding\nscheme when using orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). This paper\npresents a data-driven approach to link adaptation for multiuser multiple input\nmulitple output (MIMO) OFDM systems. A machine learning classifier is used to\nselect the modulation and coding scheme, taking as input the SNR values in the\ndifferent subcarriers and spatial streams. A new approximation is developed to\nestimate the unknown interuser interference due to the use of limited feedback.\nThis approximation allows to obtain SNR information at the transmitter with a\nminimum communication overhead. A greedy algorithm is used to perform spatial\nmode and user selection with affordable complexity, without resorting to an\nexhaustive search.

This galaxy shows significant\nHCN enhancement with respect to HCO+ and CO in the low-J transitions, which\nseems to be a common characteristic in AGN environments. Using the ALMA data,\nwe study the characteristics of the dense gas around this AGN and search for\nthe mechanism of HCN enhancement. We find a high HCN (J=4-3) to HCO+ (J=4-3)\nline ratio in the nucleus. The upper limit of the brightness temperature ratio\nof HCN (v2=1^{1f}, J=4-3) to HCN (J=4-3) is 0.08, which indicates that IR\npumping does not significantly affect the pure rotational population in this\nnucleus. We also find a higher HCN (J=4-3) to CS (J=7-6) line ratio in NGC 1097\nthan in starburst galaxies, which is more than 12.7 on the brightness\ntemperature scale. Combined from similar observations from other galaxies, we\ntentatively suggest that this ratio appears to be higher in AGN-host galaxies\nthan in pure starburst ones similar to the widely used HCN to HCO+ ratio. LTE\nand non-LTE modeling of the observed HCN and HCO+ lines using J=4-3 and 1-0\ndata from ALMA, and J=3-2 data from SMA, reveals a high HCN to HCO+ abundance\nratio (5 < [HCN]/[HCO+] < 20: non-LTE analysis) in the nucleus, and that the\nhigh-J lines (J=4-3 and 3-2) are emitted from dense (10^{4.5} < n_H2 [/cc] <\n10^6), hot (70 < Tkin [K] < 550) regions.

We here focus on the high-density parts of W43, a molecular cloud\nundergoing an efficient event of formation. The cloud structure is studied with\na column density image derived from Herschel continuum maps obtained at 70,\n160, 250, 350, and 500 micron. We identify two high-column density filamentary\nclouds, quoted as the W43-MM1 and W43-MM2 ridges, which both account for\n1.5x10^4 Msun gas mass above 10^23 cm-2 and within areas of 5 and 14pc^2,\nrespectively. We used the N_2H^+ 1--0 line to confirm that the W43-MM1 and\nW43-MM2 ridges are structures coherent in velocity and gravitationally bound,\ndespite their large velocity dispersion and ~5 kms line widths.

Among these spurious forces is\nelectrostatic attraction between a test mass and its surroundings due to the\npresence of spatially varying surface potential known as the \"patch effect.\" In\norder to make surfaces with small surface potential variation, it is necessary\nto be able to measure it. A Kelvin probe (KP) measures contact potential\ndifference (CPD), using the time-varying capacitance between the sample and a\nvibrating tip that is biased with a backing potential. Assuming that the tip\nremains constant, this measures the sample's surface potential variation. We\nexamine the operation of the KP from the perspective of parameter estimation in\nthe presence of noise. We show that, when the CPD is estimated from\nmeasurements at two separate backing potentials, the standard deviation of the\noptimal estimate depends on the total observing time. Further, the observing\ntime may be unevenly divided between the two backing potentials, provided the\nvalues of those potentials are correspondingly set. We simulate a two-stage KP\ndata analysis, including a sub-optimal estimator with advantages for real-time\noperation. Based on the real-time version, we present a novel approach to\nstabilizing the average distance of the tip from the sample. We also present\nthe results of a series of covariance analyses that validate and bound the\napplicability of the suboptimal estimator, make a comparison with the results\nof an optimal estimator and guide the user.

In particular, with knowledge first of the eavesdropper's channel\nstate information (CSI), we find the optimum waveform and transmit energy that\nminimize the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at the output of\nthe eavesdropper's maximum-SINR linear filter, while at the same time provide\nthe intended receiver with a required pre-specified SINR at the output of its\nown max-SINR filter.

However, CMB constraints are currently derived using a number of\nreasonable but yet un-tested assumptions that could potentially lead to a\nmisestimation of the true bounds. In this paper we examine the potential impact\nof these systematic effects. In particular, we separately study the propagation\nof the secondary particles produced by annihilation in two energy regimes;\nfirst following the shower from the initial particle energy to the keV scale,\nand then tracking the resulting secondary particles from this scale to the\nabsorption of their energy as heat, ionization, or excitation of the medium. We\nimprove both the high and low energy parts of the calculation, in particular\nfinding that our more accurate treatment of losses to sub-10.2 eV photons\nproduced by scattering of high-energy electrons weakens the constraints on\nparticular DM annihilation models by up to a factor of two. On the other hand,\nwe find that the uncertainties we examine for the low energy propagation do not\nsignificantly affect the results for current and upcoming CMB data. We include\nthe evaluation of the precise amount of excitation energy, in the form of\nLyman-alpha photons, produced by the propagation of the shower, and examine the\neffects of varying the Helium fraction and Helium ionization fraction. In the\nrecent literature, simple approximations for the fraction of energy absorbed in\ndifferent channels have often been used to derive CMB constraints: we assess\nthe impact of using accurate versus approximate energy fractions. Finally we\ncheck that the choice of recombination code (between RECFAST v1.5 and\nCOSMOREC), to calculate the evolution of the free electron fraction in the\npresence of dark matter annihilation, introduces negligible differences.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Jun 2013 20:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

Although\nthis matter is initially far from equilibrium, we find that the equilibrium\nexpression for heavy quark energy loss in a homogeneous strongly coupled plasma\nwith the same instantaneous energy density or pressure as that at the location\nof the quark describes many qualitative features of our results. One\ninteresting exception is that there is a time delay after the initial collision\nbefore the heavy quark energy loss becomes significant. At later times, once a\nliquid plasma described by viscous hydrodynamics has formed, expressions based\nupon assuming instantaneous homogeneity and equilibrium provide a\nsemi-quantitative description of our results - as long as the rapidity of the\nheavy quark is not too large. For a heavy quark with large rapidity, the\ngradients in the velocity of the hydrodynamic fluid result in qualitative\nconsequences for the 'drag' force acting on the quark. In certain\ncircumstances, the force required to drag the quark through the plasma can\npoint opposite to the velocity of the quark, meaning that the force that the\nplasma exerts on a quark moving through it acts in the same direction as its\nvelocity. And, generically, the force includes a component perpendicular to the\ndirection of motion of the quark.

Although the timescale for orbital decay is very\nuncertain, it should be faster for systems with larger and more evolved stars.\nIndeed, it is well established that hot Jupiters are found less frequently\naround subgiant stars than around main-sequence stars. However, the\ninterpretation of this finding has been ambiguous, because the subgiants are\nalso thought to be more massive than the F- and G-type stars that dominate the\nmain-sequence sample. Consequently it has been unclear whether the absence of\nhot Jupiters is due to tidal destruction, or inhibited formation of those\nplanets around massive stars. Here we show that the Galactic space motions of\nthe planet-hosting subgiant stars demand that on average they be similar in\nmass to the planet-hosting main-sequence F- and G-type stars. Therefore the two\nsamples are likely to differ only in age, and provide a glimpse of the same\nexoplanet population both before and after tidal evolution. As a result, the\nlack of hot Jupiters orbiting subgiants is clear evidence for their tidal\ndestruction. Questions remain, though, about the interpretation of other\nreported differences between the planet populations around subgiants and\nmain-sequence stars, such as their period and eccentricity distributions and\noverall occurrence rates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Jun 2013 20:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

Pebbles collect at the pressure\nmaximum associated with the transition from a magneto-rotational instability\n(MRI)-inactive (\"dead zone\") region to an inner MRI-active zone. A pebble ring\nbuilds up until it either becomes gravitationally unstable to form an $\\sim 1\\\nM_\\oplus$ planet directly or induces gradual planet formation via core\naccretion. The planet may undergo Type I migration into the active region,\nallowing a new pebble ring and planet to form behind it. Alternatively if\nmigration is inefficient, the planet may continue to accrete from the disk\nuntil it becomes massive enough to isolate itself from the accretion flow. A\nvariety of densities may result depending on the relative importance of\nresidual gas accretion as the planet approaches its isolation mass. The process\ncan repeat with a new pebble ring gathering at the new pressure maximum\nassociated with the retreating dead zone boundary. Our simple analytical model\nfor this scenario of inside-out planet formation yields planetary masses,\nrelative mass scalings with orbital radius, and minimum orbital separations\nconsistent with those seen by Kepler.

We find that, whilst there is a\nsignificant increase in the mass of material scattered into the inner regions\nof the planetary system following an instability, this is a short-lived effect.\nUsing the maximum lifetime of this material, we determine that even if every\nstar has a planetary system that goes unstable, there is a very low probability\nthat we observe more than a maximum of 1% of sun-like stars in the aftermath of\nan instability, and that the fraction of planetary systems currently in the\naftermath of an instability is more likely to be limited to <0.06. This\nprobability increases marginally for younger or higher mass stars. We conclude\nthat the production of warm dust in the aftermath of dynamical instabilities is\ntoo short-lived to be the dominant source of the abundantly observed\nexozodiacal dust.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Jun 2013 21:04:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

At their pre-SN\nstage, these two models have recently been shown to have spectra similar to\nthose of LBV stars and possibly explode as Type IIb SNe. Based on the wind\nproperties before the explosion, we derive the density structure of their\ncircumstellar medium. This structure is used as input for computing the SN\nradio light curve. <Results> We find that the 20Msun model shows radio light\ncurves with episodic luminosity modulations, similar to those observed in some\nType IIb SNe. This occurs because the evolution of the 20Msun model terminates\nin a region of the HR diagram where radiative stellar winds present strong\ndensity variations, caused by the bistability limit.

In this paper, we study the\nproblem of inductive matrix completion in the exact recovery setting. That is,\nwe assume that the ratings matrix is generated by applying feature vectors to a\nlow-rank matrix and the goal is to recover back the underlying matrix.\nFurthermore, we generalize the problem to that of low-rank matrix estimation\nusing rank-1 measurements. We study this generic problem and provide conditions\nthat the set of measurements should satisfy so that the alternating\nminimization method (which otherwise is a non-convex method with no convergence\nguarantees) is able to recover back the {\\em exact} underlying low-rank matrix.\n  In addition to inductive matrix completion, we show that two other low-rank\nestimation problems can be studied in our framework: a) general low-rank matrix\nsensing using rank-1 measurements, and b) multi-label regression with missing\nlabels.

We find that the Doppler shift of the central line depression\ncorrelates strongly with the vertical velocity at optical depth unity, which is\ntypically located less than 200 km below the transition region (TR). By\ncombining the Doppler shifts of the h and the k line we can retrieve the sign\nof the velocity gradient just below the TR. The intensity in the central line\ndepression is anticorrelated with the formation height, especially in subfields\nof a few square Mm. This intensity could thus be used to measure the spatial\nvariation of the height of the transition region. The intensity in the\nline-core emission peaks correlates with the temperature at its formation\nheight, especially for strong emission peaks. The peaks can thus be exploited\nas a temperature diagnostic. The wavelength difference between the blue and red\npeaks provides a diagnostic of the velocity gradients in the upper\nchromosphere.

Based on the\nmicromagnetic simulations presented in this contribution we can attribute this\ndiscrepancy to the influence of distributed disorder which vastly affects the\nvortex domain wall mobility, but is most often not taken into account in the\nmodels adopted to extract the degree of nonadiabaticity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Jun 2013 07:22:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 6 Mar 2014 10:00:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-24"}

In\nthe late gas poor phase, AGN feedback blows the gas away and terminates star\nformation. However, in the gas-rich phase(s), AGN outflows trigger star\nformation by over-compressing cold dense gas and thus provide positive feedback\non their hosts. In this paper we study this AGN-triggered starburst effect. We\nshow that star formation rate in the burst increases until the star formation\nfeedback counteracts locally the AGN outflow compression. Globally, this\npredicts a strong nearly linear statistical correlation between the AGN and\nstarburst bolometric luminosities in disc galaxies, L_* \\propto L_{AGN}^{5/6}.\nThe correlation is statistical only because AGN activity may fluctuate on short\ntime scales (as short as tens of years), and because AGN may turn off but its\neffects on the host may continue to last until the AGN-driven outflow leaves\nthe host, which may be up to 10 times longer than the duration of the AGN\nactivity. The coefficient in front of this relation depends on the clumpiness\nand morphology of the cold gas in the galaxy. A \"maximum starburst\" takes place\nin am azimuthally uniform gas disc, for which we derive an upper limit of L_*\n\\sim 50 times larger than L_{AGN} for typical quasars. For more clumpy and/or\ncompact cold gas distributions, the starburst luminosity decreases. We also\nsuggest that similar AGN-triggerred starbursts are possible in hosts of all\ngeometries, including during galaxy mergers, provided the AGN is activated.\nFinally, we note that due to the short duration of the AGN activity phase the\naccelerating influence of AGN on starbursts may be much more common than\nobservations of simultaneous AGN and starbursts would suggest.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Jun 2013 07:30:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

We construct light curves for 95 of the most frequently\nobserved ICRF2 quasars at both the 2.3 and 8.4 GHz geodetic VLBI observing\nbands. Because the appearance of new quasar components corresponds to an\nincrease in quasar flux density, these light curves alert us to potential\nchanges in source structure before they appear in VLBI images. We test how\nsource position stability depends on three astrophysical parameters: (1) Flux\ndensity variability at X-band; (2) Time lag between flares in S and X-bands;\n(3) Spectral index rms, defined as the variability in the ratio between S and\nX-band flux densities. We find that small time lags between S and X-band light\ncurves, and low spectral index variability, are good indicators of position\nstability. On the other hand, there is no strong dependence of source position\nstability on flux density variability in a single frequency band. These\nfindings can be understood by interpreting the time lag between S and X-band\nlight curves as a measure of the size of the source structure. Monitoring of\nsource flux density at multiple frequencies therefore appears to provide a\nuseful probe of quasar structure on scales important to geodesy.

The dilatonic mode acts as\nthe massive Higgs boson, whose vacuum expectation value determines the gauge\ncouplings. This mechanism requires that the quadratic divergences, or tadpoles\nof the three gauge-theory couplings, unify at a certain scale. We verify this\nstatement, and find that this occurs at \\Lambda_u ~ 4x10^7 GeV. The tadpole\ncancellation condition, together with the dilaton self-energy, fixes the value\nof the unified tadpole coefficient to be 1/[4 ln(\\Lambda_cut/\\Lambda_u)]. The\nobserved values of the coupling constants at \\Lambda_u then implies \\Lambda_cut\n~ 4x10^18 GeV, which is close to the value of the reduced Planck mass\nMR_Pl=M_Pl/sqrt(8 pi)=2.4 x 10^18 GeV. In other words, by assuming a cutoff at\nM_Pl or MR_Pl, we are able to obtain predictions for the gauge couplings which\nagree with the true values to within a few percent. It turns out that this\nsymmetry breaking can only take place if mass is generated with the aid of some\nother means such as electroweak symmetry breaking. Assuming dynamical symmetry\nbreaking originating at MR_Pl, we obtain M_chi ~ 10^9 GeV, which is not\nunreasonable but somewhat higher than \\Lambda_u. The cancellation of an anomaly\nin the dilaton self-energy requires that the number of fermionic generations\nequals three.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Jun 2013 08:50:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-26"}

A generalization of this concept to finite sets of matrices is\nas follows: a set of matrices $\\mathcal M = \\{A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_m \\}$ is\nprimitive if $A_{i_1} A_{i_2} \\ldots A_{i_k}$ is positive for some indices\n$i_1, i_2, ..., i_k$. The concept of primitive sets of matrices comes up in a\nnumber of problems within the study of discrete-time switched systems. In this\npaper, we analyze the computational complexity of deciding if a given set of\nmatrices is primitive and we derive bounds on the length of the shortest\npositive product.\n  We show that while primitivity is algorithmically decidable, unless $P=NP$ it\nis not possible to decide primitivity of a matrix set in polynomial time.\nMoreover, we show that the length of the shortest positive sequence can be\nsuperpolynomial in the dimension of the matrices. On the other hand, defining\n${\\mathcal P}$ to be the set of matrices with no zero rows or columns, we give\na simple combinatorial proof of a previously-known characterization of\nprimitivity for matrices in ${\\mathcal P}$ which can be tested in polynomial\ntime. This latter observation is related to the well-known 1964 conjecture of\nCerny on synchronizing automata; in fact, any bound on the minimal length of a\nsynchronizing word for synchronizing automata immediately translates into a\nbound on the length of the shortest positive product of a primitive set of\nmatrices in ${\\mathcal P}$.

The amplitude information allowed to achieve spatial\nresolutions about a factor of 10 smaller than the pitch and a time resolution\nclose to the theoretical limit imposed by the layout.\n  The PixelGEM central tracking system consisting of five detectors, slightly\nimproved with respect to the prototype, was completely installed in the COMPASS\nspectrometer in spring 2008.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Jun 2013 11:40:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-05"}

The overlap of a transiting planet and a stellar spot, for\ninstance, can produce anomalies in the transit light curves that may lead to\ninaccurate estimation of the transit duration, depth and timing. For instance\nsuch inaccuracies can affect the precise derivation of the planet's radius. In\nthis paper, we present the results of a quantitative study on the effects of\nstellar spots on high precision transit light curves. We show that spot\nanomalies can lead to the estimate of a planet radius that is 4% smaller than\nthe real value. The effects on the transit duration can also be of the order of\n4%, longer or shorter. Depending on the size and distribution of spots,\nanomalies can also produce transit timing variations with significant\namplitudes. For instance, TTVs with signal amplitudes of 200 seconds can be\nproduced when the spot is completely dark and as large as the largest Sun spot.\nOur study also indicates that the minimum size of a stellar spot with\ndetectable affects on the high precision transit light curve is around 0.03\ntime the stellar radius for typical Kepler telescope precision. We also show\nthat the strategy of including more free parameters (such as transit depth and\nduration) in the fitting procedure to measure the transit time of each\nindividual transit will not produce accurate results in the case of active\nstars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Jun 2013 12:16:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 Jul 2013 12:50:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-31"}

We use smooth particle\nhydrodynamical simulations (SPH) with chemo-photometric implementation which\nprovide dynamical and morphological information together with the spectral\nenergy distribution (SED) at each evolutionary stage. As test cases, we\nsimulate the evolution of two such S0s: NGC 1533 and NGC 3626. The merging of\ntwo halos with mass ratio 2:1, initially just composed of dark matter (DM) and\ngas, well match their observed SEDs, their surface brightness profiles and\ntheir overall kinematics. The residual star formation today \"rejuvenating\" the\nring/arm like structures in these S0s is then a mere consequence of a major\nmerger, i.e. this is a phase during the merger episode. The peculiar\nkinematical features, e.g. gas-stars counter rotation in NGC 3626, depends on\nthe halos initial impact parameters. Furthermore, our simulations allow to\nfollow, in a fully consistent way, the transition of these S0s through the\ngreen valley in the NUV-r vs. Mr colour magnitude diagram, which they cross in\nabout 3-5 Gyr, before reaching their current position in the red sequence. We\nconclude that a viable mechanism driving the evolution of S0s in groups is of\ngravitational origin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Jun 2013 13:19:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

Gradually increasing the amount of energy pumped into the system,\nwhich is realized either by strengthening the modulation amplitude or by\nincreasing the excitation time, produces a series of nonequilibrium states,\nwith the growing fraction of atoms for which the gauge symmetry is restored.

While the undercladding\nproblem can be partially addressed by substrate removal techniques, the\ncomplexity of co-integrating photonics with state-of-the-art transistors and\nreal estate competition between electronics and photonics remain problematic.\nWe show here a platform for deposited GHz silicon photonics based on\npolycrystalline silicon with high optical quality suitable for high performance\nelectro-optic devices.

However,\nmass-imbalanced and spin-imbalanced gases are not accessible to MC calculations\ndue to the infamous sign problem. It was recently pointed out that the sign\nproblem, for finite spin imbalance, can be circumvented by resorting to\nimaginary polarizations and analytic continuation. Large parts of the phase\ndiagram spanned by temperature and polarization then become accessible to MC\ncalculations. We propose to apply a similar strategy to the mass-imbalanced\ncase, which opens up the possibility to study the associated phase diagram with\nMC calculations.

The largest diffraction signals are achieved at the longest\nwavelength that supports a given resolution, which should be better than 0.3\nnm. We propose a configuration which combines self-seeding and undulator\ntapering techniques with the emittance-spoiler method in order to increase the\nXFEL output peak power and to shorten the pulse duration up to a level\nsufficient for performing bio-imaging of single protein molecules at the\noptimal photon energy range, i.e. around 4 keV.

Preferential attachment (PA) is considered a common explanation to the\nself organization of evolving networks, suggesting that new nodes prefer to\nattach to more popular nodes. The PA model results in broad degree\ndistributions, found in many networks, but cannot explain other common\nproperties such as: The growth of nodes arriving late and Clustering (community\nstructure). Here we show that when the tendency of networks to adhere to trends\nis incorporated into the PA model, it can produce networks with such\nproperties. Namely, in trending networks, newly arriving nodes may become\ncentral at random, forming new clusters. In particular, we show that when the\nnetwork is young it is more susceptible to trends, but even older networks may\nhave trendy new nodes that become central in their structure. Alternatively,\nnetworks can be seen as composed of two parts: static, governed by a power law\ndegree distribution, and a dynamic part governed by trends, as we show on Wiki\npages. Our results also show that the arrival of trending new nodes not only\ncreates new clusters, but also has an effect on the relative importance and\ncentrality of all other nodes in the network. This can explain a variety of\nreal world networks in economics, social and online networks, and cultural\nnetworks. Products popularity, formed by the network of people's opinions,\nexhibit these properties. Some lines of products are increasingly susceptible\nto trends and hence to shifts in popularity, while others are less trendy and\nhence more stable.

In the past few years, a new perspective has opened in the study of\nfrustration through the creation of artificial frustrated magnetic systems.\nThese materials consist of arrays of lithographically fabricated single-domain\nferromagnetic nanostructures that behave like giant Ising spins.

The\ndegrees of freedom of the material can not only be directly tuned, but also\nindividually observed.

This article explores the interaction between elementary particles\nand a background action field of stochastic character and it is also determined\nthat the standard deviation of the particle-background field interaction is\nessentially the Planck constant, since the expressions of the energy according\nto the Planck postulate and the momentum according to the Louis de Broglie\nthesis follow in a natural way.

In\nthis work, the Lagrangian formulation of a magnetostatic field in three spatial\ndimensions $(D=3)$ described by Kempf algebra is presented in the special case\nof $\\beta'=2\\beta$ up to the first order over $\\beta$. We show that at the\nclassical level there is a similarity between magnetostatics in the presence of\na minimal length scale (modified magnetostatics) and the magnetostatic sector\nof the Abelian Lee-Wick model in three spatial dimensions. The integral form of\nAmpere's law and the energy density of a magnetostatic field in the modified\nmagnetostatics are obtained. Also, the Biot-Savart law in the modified\nmagnetostatics is found. By studying the effect of minimal length corrections\nto the gyromagnetic moment of the muon, we conclude that the upper bound on the\nisotropic minimal length scale in three spatial dimensions is\n$4.42\\times10^{-19}m$. The relationship between magnetostatics with a minimal\nlength and the Gaete-Spallucci non-local magnetostatics (J. Phys.

The present objective is to\ndevelop such a model, usable in finite element programs. The comminution at\nvery high strain rates can dissipate a large portion of the kinetic energy of\nan impacting missile. The spatial derivative of the energy dissipated by\ncomminution gives a force resisting the penetration, which is superposed on the\nnodal forces obtained from the static constitutive model in a finite element\nprogram. The present theory is inspired partly by Grady's model for comminution\ndue to explosion inside a hollow sphere, and partly by analogy with turbulence.\nIn high velocity turbulent flow, the energy dissipation rate is enhanced by the\nformation of micro-vortices (eddies) which dissipate energy by viscous shear\nstress. Similarly, here it is assumed that the energy dissipation at fast\ndeformation of a confined solid gets enhanced by the release of kinetic energy\nof the motion associated with a high-rate shear strain of forming particles.\nFor simplicity, the shape of these particles in the plane of maximum shear rate\nis considered to be regular hexagons. The rate of release of free energy\ndensity consisting of the sum of this energy and the fracture energy of the\ninterface between the forming particle is minimized. The particle sizes are\nassumed to be distributed according to Schuhmann's power law. It is concluded\nthat the minimum particle size is inversely proportional to the (2/3)-power of\nthe shear strain rate, that the kinetic energy release is to proportional to\nthe (2/3)-power, and that the dynamic comminution creates an apparent material\nviscosity inversely proportional to the (1/3)-power of the shear strain rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Jun 2013 09:11:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-06"}

This is about 1000 times faster than the original DBIE used on\nsolar NLFFF modeling. Using the SDO/HMI vector magnetogram as the bottom\nboundary condition, the reconstructed magnetic field lines are compared with\nthe projected EUV loop structures from different views three-dimensionally by\nSDO/AIA and STEREO A/B spacecraft simultaneously for the first time. They show\nvery good agreement so that the topological configurations of the magnetic\nfields can be analyzed, thus its role in the flare process of the active region\ncan be better understood. A quantitative comparison with some stereoscopically\nreconstructed coronal loops shows that the present averaged misalignment angles\nare at the same order as the state-of-the-art results obtained with\nreconstructed coronal loops as prescribed conditions and better than other\nNLFFF methods. It is found that the observed coronal loop structures can be\ngrouped into bundles of closed and open loops with some central bright coronal\nloops around the polarity inversion line (PIL). The reconstructed\nhighly-shearing magnetic field lines agree very well with the low-lying\nS-shaped filament channel along PIL. They are in a pivot position to all other\nsurrounding coronal structures, and a group of electric current lines\nco-aligned with the central bright EUV loops overlying the filament channel is\nalso obtained. This central lower-lying magnetic field loop system must have\nplayed a key role in powering the flare. It should be noted that while a\nstrand-like coronal feature along PIL may be related to the filament, one\ncannot simply attribute all the coronal bright features along PIL to\nmanifestation of the filament without any stereoscopically information. It\nshows that DBIE is rigorous and effective.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Jun 2013 07:56:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}
