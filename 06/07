Beginning with the equations for\nincompressible MHD, an asymptotic analytical solution for the nonlinear\nevolution of these Alfven wave collisions is derived in the weakly nonlinear\nlimit. The resulting qualitative picture of nonlinear energy transfer due to\nthis mechanism involves two steps: first, the primary counterpropagating Alfven\nwaves interact to generate an inherently nonlinear, purely magnetic secondary\nfluctuation with no parallel variation; second, the two primary waves each\ninteract with this secondary fluctuation to transfer energy secularly to two\ntertiary Alfven waves. These tertiary modes are linear Alfven waves with the\nsame parallel wavenumber as the primary waves, indicating the lack of a\nparallel cascade. The amplitude of these tertiary modes increases linearly with\ntime due to the coherent nature of the resonant four-wave interaction\nresponsible for the nonlinear energy transfer.

A variety of models differ primarily in\nthe method by which the deflagration leads to a detonation. A common feature of\nthe models, however, is that all of them involve the propagation of the\ndetonation through a white dwarf that is either expanding or contracting, where\nthe stellar internal velocity profile depends on both time and space. In this\nwork, we investigate the effects of the pre-detonation stellar internal\nvelocity profile and the post-detonation velocity of expansion on the\nproduction of alpha-particle nuclei, including Ni56, which are the primary\nnuclei produced by the detonation wave. We perform one-dimensional hydrodynamic\nsimulations of the explosion phase of the white dwarf for center and off-center\ndetonations with five different stellar velocity profiles at the onset of the\ndetonation. We observe two distinct post-detonation expansion phases:\nrarefaction and bulk expansion. Almost all the burning to Ni56 occurs only in\nthe rarefaction phase, and its expansion time scale is influenced by\npre-existing flow structure in the star, in particular by the pre-detonation\nstellar velocity profile. We find that the mass fractions of the alpha-particle\nnuclei, including Ni56, are tight functions of the empirical physical parameter\nrho_up/v_down, where rho_up is the mass density immediately upstream of the\ndetonation wave front and v_down is the velocity of the flow immediately\ndownstream of the detonation wave front. We also find that v_down depends on\nthe pre-detonation flow velocity. We conclude that the properties of the\npre-existing flow, in particular the internal stellar velocity profile,\ninfluence the final isotopic composition of burned matter produced by the\ndetonation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Jun 2013 17:33:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

The results are\nthen compared to the existing progenitor models of Ibc SNe, where it is\nconcluded that it is highly likely that at least two progenitor channels exist\nfor producing a Ibc SN: most Ibc SNe arise via binary interactions, where the\nmass of the stellar progenitor is less than what is attributed to a Wolf Rayet\nstar.

Our monitoring started\nwith the optical discovery of the nova and extend to day +270, well past the\nend of the super-soft phase in X-rays. The nova displayed very smoothly\nevolving lightcurves. A bifurcation between y and V light-curves took place at\nthe start of the SSS phase, and a knee developed toward the end of the SSS\nphase. The apparent magnitude of the nova at the unobserved optical maximum is\nconstrained to +2.8=<V=<4.2. The appearance, grow in amplitude and then demise\nof a 0.29585 (+/-0.00002) days orbital modulation of the optical brightness was\nfollowed along the nova evolution. The observed modulation has a\nnear-sinusoidal shape and a weak secondary minimum at phase 0.5. We favor an\ninterpretation in terms of super-imposed ellipsoidal distortion of the Roche\nlobe filling companion and irradiation of its side facing the WD. Similar\nlightcurves are typical of symbiotic stars where a Roche lobe filling giant is\nirradiated by a very hot WD. Given the high orbital inclination, mutual\noccultation between the donor star and the accretion disk could contribute to\nthe observed modulation. The optical+infrared spectral energy distribution of\nNova Mon 2012 during the quiescence preceeding the outburst is nicely fitted by\na early K-type main-sequence star (~K3V) at 1.5 kpc distance, reddened by\nE(B-V)=0.38, with a WD companion and an accretion disk contributing to the\nobserved blue excess and moderate Halpha emission. A typical early K-type\nmain-sequence star with a mass of ~0.75 Msun and a radius of ~0.8 Rsun, would\nfill its Roche lobe for a P=0.29585 day orbital period and a more massive WD\ncompanion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Jun 2013 18:29:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

Within certain redshift ranges, and especially at z ~ 6-7, such lines\nmay be strong enough to reduce estimates of the stellar masses and ages of\ngalaxies compared those derived assuming broad-band photometry represents\nstellar light alone. To test this hypothesis at the highest redshifts where\nsuch lines can be probed with ground-based facilities, we examine the\nnear-infrared spectra of a representative sample of 20 3.0 < z < 3.8 Lyman\nbreak galaxies using the newly-commissioned MOSFIRE near-infrared spectrograph\nat the Keck I telescope. We use this data to derive the rest-frame equivalent\nwidths (EW) of [O III] emission and show that these are comparable to estimates\nderived using the SED fitting technique introduced for sources of known\nredshift by Stark et al (2013). Although our current sample is modest, its [O\nIII] EW distribution is consistent with that inferred for H\\alpha\\ based on SED\nfitting of Stark et al's larger sample of 3.8 < z < 5 galaxies.

Reasons for the scaling behavior of landslides are\npoorly known. We investigate the possibility of using the Transient Rainfall\nInfiltration and Grid-Based Regional Slope-Stability analysis code (TRIGRS), a\nconsolidated, physically-based, numerical model that describes the\nstability/instability conditions of natural slopes forced by rainfall, to\ndetermine the frequency statistics of the area of the unstable slopes and the\nrainfall intensity (I) - duration (D) conditions that result in landslides in a\nregion. We apply TRIGRS in a portion of the Upper Tiber River Basin, Central\nItaly. The spatially distributed model predicts the stability/instability\nconditions of individual grid cells, given the local terrain and rainfall\nconditions. We run TRIGRS using multiple, synthetic rainfall histories, and we\ncompare the modeling results with empirical evidences of the area of landslides\nand of the rainfall conditions that have caused landslides in the study area.\nOur findings revealed that TRIGRS is capable of reproducing the frequency of\nthe size of the patches of terrain predicted as unstable by the model, which\nmatch the frequency size statistics of landslides in the study area, and the\nmean rainfall D, I conditions that result in unstable slopes in the study area,\nwhich match rainfall I-D thresholds for possible landslide occurrence. Our\nresults are a step towards understanding the mechanisms that give rise to\nlandslide scaling properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Jun 2013 20:46:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 14 Mar 2014 16:46:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-17"}

At 2.4 Earth radii, Kepler-22b is too large to\nbe considered an Earth-analog, but should the planet host a moon large enough\nto maintain an atmosphere, then the Kepler-22 system may yet possess a telluric\nworld. Aside from being within the habitable-zone, the target is attractive due\nto the availability of previously measured precise radial velocities and low\nintrinsic photometric noise, which has also enabled asteroseismology studies of\nthe star. For these reasons, Kepler-22b was selected as a target-of-opportunity\nby the 'Hunt for Exomoons with Kepler' (HEK) project. In this work, we conduct\na photodynamical search for an exomoon around Kepler-22b leveraging the\ntransits, radial velocities and asteroseismology plus several new tools\ndeveloped by the HEK project to improve exomoon searches. We find no evidence\nfor an exomoon around the planet and exclude moons of mass >0.5 Earth masses to\n95% confidence. By signal injection and blind retrieval, we demonstrate that an\nEarth-like moon is easily detected for this planet even when the\ntime-correlated noise of the data set is taken into account.

In a Monte Carlo simulation we generate more than 800\nspectra, distribute them to 10 different classifiers and study how the\ndifferent simulation parameters affect the appearance of the spectra. SNe IIn\nshowing some structure over the continuum were characterized as SNe IInS. We\ndemonstrate that the flux ratio of the underlying SN to the continuum fv is the\nmost important parameter determining the spectral classification. Thermonuclear\nSNe get progressively classified as Ia-CSM, IInS and IIn as fv decreases. The\ntransition between Ia-CSM and IInS occurs at fv~0.2-0.3. It shown that SNe\nIa-CSM are found at the magnitude range -19.5> M >-21.6, in good agreement with\nobservations, and that the faintest SN IIn that can hide a SN Ia has M = -20.1.\nThe sample of SNe Ia-CSM shows an association with 91T-like SNe Ia. Our\nexperiment does not support that this association is due to a luminosity bias\n(91T-like being brighter than normal Ia). We therefore conclude that this\nassociation has real physical origins and we propose that 91T-like explosions\nresult from single degenerate progenitors. Despite the similarities between SNe\nIbc and SNe Ia, the number of misclassifications between these types was small\nand mostly at low S/N. Combined with the luminosity function needed to\nreproduce the observed SN Ia-CSM luminosities, it is unlikely that SNe Ibc\nconstitute an important contaminant within this sample. We show how Type II\nspectra transition to IIn and how the Ha profiles vary with fv. SNe IIn fainter\nthan M = -17.2 are unable to mask SNe IIP brighter than M = -15. A simulation\nincluding radiative transfer shows that our simplified model is a good first\norder approximation.

For a scalar field on a\nradiation-dominated background we construct the exact solution for the\ntime-evolving wave functional and study properties of the associated field\ntrajectories. It is shown that the time evolution of a field mode on expanding\nspace is mathematically equivalent to that of a standard harmonic oscillator\nwith a 'retarded time' that depends on the wavelength of the mode. In the far\nsuper-Hubble regime the equivalent oscillator evolves over only one Hubble\ntime, yielding a simple mechanism whereby relaxation to the Born rule can be\nsuppressed on very large scales. We present numerical simulations illustrating\nhow the expansion of space can cause a retardation of relaxation in the\nsuper-Hubble regime. Given these results it is natural to expect a suppression\nof quantum noise at super-Hubble wavelengths. Such suppression could have taken\nplace in a pre-inflationary era, resulting in a large-scale power deficit in\nthe cosmic microwave background.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Jun 2013 00:04:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 Sep 2013 02:13:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-19"}

While inherently insensitive to visible spectrum\nillumination changes, IR images introduce specific challenges of their own,\nmost notably sensitivity to factors which affect facial heat emission patterns,\ne.g. emotional state, ambient temperature, and alcohol intake. In addition,\nfacial expression and pose changes are more difficult to correct in IR images\nbecause they are less rich in high frequency detail which is an important cue\nfor fitting any deformable model. We describe a novel method which addresses\nthese challenges. To normalize for pose and facial expression changes we\ngenerate a synthetic frontal image of a face in a canonical, neutral facial\nexpression from an image of the face in an arbitrary pose and facial\nexpression. This is achieved by piecewise affine warping which follows active\nappearance model (AAM) fitting. This is the first publication which explores\nthe use of an AAM on thermal IR images; we propose a pre-processing step which\nenhances detail in thermal images, making AAM convergence faster and more\naccurate. To overcome the problem of thermal IR image sensitivity to the\npattern of facial temperature emissions we describe a representation based on\nreliable anatomical features. In contrast to previous approaches, our\nrepresentation is not binary; rather, our method accounts for the reliability\nof the extracted features. This makes the proposed representation much more\nrobust both to pose and scale changes. The effectiveness of the proposed\napproach is demonstrated on the largest public database of thermal IR images of\nfaces on which it achieved 100% identification, significantly outperforming\nprevious methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Jun 2013 05:03:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-10"}

In the case of\npower-law spectra, I show that it is possible to estimate the difference\nbetween the synchrotron emissivity from a region with such a field and that\nfrom the commonly assumed arrangement where $B$ is constant everywhere, though\nfully tangled, and that this difference is small, though it increases if the\nelectron energy density scales with the field.

Aging open clusters are one\nof the sources of field stars. The disruption rate of open clusters slows down\nwith age but, as an object gets older, the distinction between the remaining\ncluster or open cluster remnant (OCR) and the surrounding field becomes less\nand less obvious. As a result, finding good OCR candidates or confirming the\nOCR nature of some of the best candidates still remains elusive.

The scheme\nSwadloon does not rely on any fingerprints and is very easy to use: a user only\nneeds to shake the phone for a short duration before walking and localization.\nOur Swadloon design exploits a key observation: the relative shift and velocity\nof the phone-shaking movement corresponds to the subtle phase and frequency\nshift of the Doppler effects experienced in the received acoustic signal by the\nphone. A novel method is designed to derive the direction from the phone to the\nacoustic source by combining the velocity calculated from the subtle Doppler\nshift with the one from the inertial sensors of the phone. Then a real-time\nprecise localization and tracking is enabled by using a few anchor speakers\nwith known locations. Major challenges in implementing Swadloon are to measure\nthe frequency shift precisely and to estimate the shaking velocity accurately\nwhen the speed of phone-shaking is low and changes arbitrarily. We propose\nrigorous methods to address these challenges, then design and deploy Swadloon\nin several floors of an indoor building each with area about 2000m^2. Our\nextensive experiments show that the mean error of direction finding is around\n2.1 degree when the acoustic source is within the range of 32m. For indoor\nlocalization, the 90-percentile errors are under 0.92m, while the maximum error\nis 1.73m and the mean is about 0.5m. For real-time tracking, the errors are\nwithin 0.4m for walks of 51m.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Jun 2013 08:30:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-10"}

The pair production occurs through\nW and Z gauge bosons fusion process. In the neutrinophilic model, the vacuum\nexpectation value (VEV) of the second Higgs doublet is small and is\nproportional to the neutrino mass. The smallness of VEV is associated with the\napproximate global U(1) symmetry which is slightly broken. Therefore, there is\na suppression factor for the U(1) charge breaking process. The second Higgs\ndoublet has U(1) charge and its single production from the gauge boson fusion\nviolates the U(1) charge conservation and is suppressed strongly to occur. In\ncontrast to the single production, the pair production of the Higgses conserves\nU(1) charge and the approximate symmetry does not forbid it. To search for the\npair productions in collider experiment,we study the production cross section\nof a pair of the charged Higgs and neutral Higgs bosons in e+ e- collision with\ncenter of energy from 600 (GeV) to 2000 (GeV). The total cross section varies\nfrom 10^{-4}(fb) to 10^{-3}(fb) for degenerate (200 GeV) charged and neutral\nHiggses mass case. The background process to the signal is gauge bosons pair W\n+ Z production and their decays. We show the signal over background ratio is\nabout 2% ~ 3% by combining the cross section ratio with ratios of branching\nfractions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Jun 2013 09:36:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 13 Jul 2013 02:20:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 31 Mar 2014 14:21:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-06"}

We model the light curves produced by exoplanets transiting a\nstar which possesses a Shkadov thruster, and show how the parameters of the\nplanet and the properties of the thruster can be disentangled. provided that\nradial velocity follow-up measurements are possible, and that other obscuring\nphenomena typical to exoplanet transit curves (such as the presence of\nstarspots or intrinsic stellar noise) do not dominate.

We examine the stellar mass-size relation for a sample of\nisolated galaxies interpreted as stellar systems where evolution has been\nmainly governed by internal processes. Effects of environment on the stellar\nmass-size relation are evaluated by comparing our results with samples of less\nisolated early- and late-type galaxies, as well as, for the first time,\ndifferent spiral subtypes. We find no difference in the stellar mass-size\nrelation for very isolated and less isolated early-type galaxies. We find that\nlate-type isolated galaxies are ~1.2 times larger than less isolated objects\nwith similar mass. Isolated galaxies and comparison samples were divided into 6\nmorphological ranges (E/S0, Spirals, Sb, Sbc, Sc, and Scd-Sdm) and 5 stellar\nmass bins between log(M*)=[9,11.5]. In all cases the relation is better defined\nand has less scatter for the isolated galaxies. We find that as the\nmorphological type becomes later the galaxy size (for a fixed stellar mass)\nbecomes larger. For the lowest stellar mass bins log(M*)=[9,10] we find good\nagreement between sizes of AMIGA and comparison spirals. The isolated spiral\ngalaxies in the high stellar mass bins log(M*)=[10,11] tend to be larger than\nless isolated galaxies. This difference in size is found for all spiral\nsubtypes and becomes larger when we compare fully isolated galaxies with\ngalaxies having 2 or more satellites (neighbors within 3 magnitudes of\ndifference at a distance less than 250 kpc from the galaxy). Our results\nsuggest that massive spiral galaxies located in low density environments, both\nin terms of major companions and satellites, have larger sizes than samples of\nless isolated galaxies.

To reach these goals, several kinds of spin chains have\nbeen suggested, which differ in the degree of fine-tuning, or engineering, of\nthe system parameters. In this work we present a systematic study of two\nimportant classes of such chains. In one class only the spin couplings at the\nends of the chain have to be adjusted to a value different from the bulk\ncoupling constant, while in the other class every coupling has to have a\nspecific value.

Near the Mott transition, a strongly correlated\nmetal exhibiting bad metal features and strong orbital selectivity is\nstabilized due to the interplay of Hund's coupling and orbital-degeneracy\nbreaking. Particularly for the alkaline iron selenides, the ordered vacancies\neffectively reduce the kinetic energy, thereby pushing the system further into\nthe Mott-insulating regime; in the metallic state, there exists an\norbital-selective Mott phase in which the iron 3d xy orbital is Mott localized\nwhile the other 3d orbitals are still itinerant.

We select four candidate\nSculptor-like galaxies from the satellite galaxy catalogue generated by\nimplementation of a version of the Munich semi-analytic model for galaxy\nformation on the level 2 Aquarius dark matter simulations. We follow explicitly\nthe evolution of several chemical elements, both in the cold gas out of which\nthe stars form and in the hot medium residing in the halo. We take into account\nin detail the lifetimes of stars of different initial masses, the distribution\nof the delay times for type Ia supernova explosions and the dependency of the\nstellar yields from the initial metallicity of the stars. We allow large\nfractions of metals to be deposited into the hot phase, either directly as\nstars die or through reheated gas flows powered by supernova explosions. In\norder to reproduce both the observed metallicity distribution function and the\nobserved abundance ratios of long-lived stars of Sculptor, large fractions of\nthe reheated metals must never re-enter regions of active star formation. Our\nanalysis sets further constraints on the semi-analytical models and, at large,\non possible metal enrichment scenarios for the Sculptor dwarf spheroidal\ngalaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Jun 2013 13:36:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

Straightforward implementations using a double loop over particle\npairs have traditionally worked well, especially since compilers usually do a\ngood job of unrolling the inner loop. In order to reach high performance on\nmodern CPU and accelerator architectures, single-instruction multiple-data\n(SIMD) parallelization has become essential. Avoiding memory bottlenecks is\nalso increasingly important and requires reducing the ratio of memory to\narithmetic operations. Moreover, when pairs only interact within a certain\ncut-off distance, good SIMD utilization can only be achieved by reordering\ninput and output data, which quickly becomes a limiting factor. Here we present\nan algorithm for SIMD parallelization based on grouping a fixed number of\nparticles, e.g. 2, 4, or 8, into spatial clusters. Calculating all interactions\nbetween particles in a pair of such clusters improves data reuse compared to\nthe traditional scheme and results in a more efficient SIMD parallelization.\nAdjusting the cluster size allows the algorithm to map to SIMD units of various\nwidths. This flexibility not only enables fast and efficient implementation on\ncurrent CPUs and accelerator architectures like GPUs or Intel MIC, but it also\nmakes the algorithm future-proof.

The work considers a broad setting where communication takes place\nin the presence of a random fading process, and in the presence of a feedback\nprocess that, at any point in time, may provide CSIT estimates - of some\narbitrary accuracy - for any past, current or future channel realization. This\nfeedback quality may fluctuate in time across all ranges of CSIT accuracy and\ntimeliness, ranging from perfectly accurate and instantaneously available\nestimates, to delayed estimates of minimal accuracy. Under standard\nassumptions, the work derives the degrees-of-freedom (DoF) region, which is\ntight for a large range of CSIT quality. This derived DoF region concisely\ncaptures the effect of channel correlations, the accuracy of predicted,\ncurrent, and delayed-CSIT, and generally captures the effect of the quality of\nCSIT offered at any time, about any channel.\n  The work also introduces novel schemes which - in the context of imperfect\nand delayed CSIT - employ encoding and decoding with a phase-Markov structure.\nThe results hold for a large class of block and non-block fading channel\nmodels, and they unify and extend many prior attempts to capture the effect of\nimperfect and delayed feedback.

While inherently insensitive to visible spectrum\nillumination changes, IR data introduces specific challenges of its own, most\nnotably sensitivity to factors which affect facial heat emission patterns, e.g.\nemotional state, ambient temperature, and alcohol intake. In addition, facial\nexpression and pose changes are more difficult to correct in IR images because\nthey are less rich in high frequency detail which is an important cue for\nfitting any deformable model. In this paper we describe a novel method which\naddresses these major challenges. Specifically, when comparing two thermal IR\nimages of faces, we mutually normalize their poses and facial expressions by\nusing an active appearance model (AAM) to generate synthetic images of the two\nfaces with a neutral facial expression and in the same view (the average of the\ntwo input views). This is achieved by piecewise affine warping which follows\nAAM fitting. A major contribution of our work is the use of an AAM ensemble in\nwhich each AAM is specialized to a particular range of poses and a particular\nregion of the thermal IR face space. Combined with the contributions from our\nprevious work which addressed the problem of reliable AAM fitting in the\nthermal IR spectrum, and the development of a person-specific representation\nrobust to transient changes in the pattern of facial temperature emissions, the\nproposed ensemble framework accurately matches faces across the full range of\nyaw from frontal to profile, even in the presence of scale variation (e.g. due\nto the varying distance of a subject from the camera).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Jun 2013 04:17:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-11"}

The\nmetaphysical underpinning of science includes statements about the process of\nscience itself, and the nature of both the philosophical and material objects\ninvolved in a scientific investigation. By developing a formalism for an\nabstract mathematical description of inherently non-mathematical (physical)\nobjects, an attempt is made to clarify the mechanisms and implications of the\nphilosophical tool of Ansatz. Outcomes of this style of analysis include a\npossible explanation for the philosophical issue of the 'unreasonable\neffectiveness' of mathematics as raised by Wigner, and an investigation into\nformal definitions of the terms: 'principles', 'evidence', 'existence' and\n'universes', that are consistent with the conventions used in physics.\n  It is found that the formalism places restrictions on the mathematical\nproperties of objects that represent the tools and terms mentioned above. This\nallows one to make testable predictions regarding physics itself (where the\nnature of the tools of investigation is now entirely abstract) just as\nscientific theories make predictions about the universe at hand. That is, the\nmathematical structure of objects defined within the new formalism has\nphilosophical consequences (via logical arguments) that lead to profound\ninsights into the nature of the universe, which may serve to guide the course\nof future investigations in science and philosophy, and precipitate inspiring\nnew avenues of integrated research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Jun 2013 01:26:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Nov 2022 06:12:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-17"}
