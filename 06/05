The targets have been selected to sample the two BSS\nsequences discovered, with 7 BSSs along the blue sequence and 8 along the red\none. No difference in the kinematical properties of the two groups of BSSs has\nbeen found. In particular, almost all the observed BSSs have projected\nrotational velocity lower than ~30 km/s, with only one (blue) fast rotating BSS\n(>90 km/s), identified as a W UMa binary. This rotational velocity distribution\nis similar to those obtained in 47 Tucanae and NGC 6397, while M4 remains the\nonly GC studied so far harboring a large fraction of fast rotating BSSs. All\nstars hotter than ~7800 K (regardless of the parent BSS sequence) show iron\nabundances larger than those measured from normal cluster stars, with a\nclearcut trend with the effective temperature. This behaviour suggests that\nparticle trasport mechanisms driven by radiative levitation occur in the\nphotosphere of these stars, as already observed for the BSSs in NGC 6397.\nFinally, 4 BSSs belonging to the red sequence (not affected by radiative\nlevitation) show a strong depletion of [O/Fe], with respect to the abundance\nmeasured in Red Giant Branch and Horizontal Branch stars. This O-depletion is\ncompatible with the chemical signature expected in BSSs formed by mass transfer\nprocesses in binary systems, in agreement with the mechanism proposed for the\nformation of BSSs in the red sequence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Jun 2013 16:00:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

The sample includes 21 quasars (= broad line radio\ngalaxies) and 17 narrow line radio galaxies (NLRGs) with matched 178 MHz radio\nluminosity (log L_R ~ 44-45). The quasars have high radio core-fraction, high\nX-ray luminosities (log L_X ~ 45-46) and soft X-ray hardness ratios (HR ~ -0.5)\nindicating low obscuration. The NLRGs have lower core-fraction, lower apparent\nX-ray luminosities (log L_X ~ 43-45) and mostly hard X-ray hardness ratios\n(HR>0) indicating obscuration (log N_H ~ 22-24 cm^-2). These properties and the\ncorrelation between obscuration and radio core-fraction are consistent with\norientation-dependent obscuration as in Unification models. About half the\nNLRGs have soft X-ray hardness ratios and/or high [OIII] emission line to X-ray\nluminosity ratio suggesting obscuration by Compton thick (CT) material so that\nscattered nuclear or extended X-ray emission dominates (as in NGC1068).

In the presence of\nergodic fading, communicating the channel state information (CSI) from the BSs\nto the CU may require a sizable part of the backhaul capacity. In a prior work,\nthis aspect was studied by assuming a Compress-Forward-Estimate (CFE) approach,\nwhereby the BSs compress the training signal and CSI estimation takes place at\nthe CU. In this work, instead, an Estimate-Compress-Forward (ECF) approach is\ninvestigated, whereby the BSs perform CSI estimation and forward a compressed\nversion of the CSI to the CU. This choice is motivated by the information\ntheoretic optimality of separate estimation and compression. Various ECF\nstrategies are proposed that perform either separate or joint compression of\nestimated CSI and received signal. Moreover, the proposed strategies are\ncombined with distributed source coding when considering multiple BSs.\n\"Semi-coherent\" strategies are also proposed that do not convey any CSI or\ntraining information on the backhaul links. Via numerical results, it is shown\nthat a proper design of ECF strategies based on joint received signal and\nestimated CSI compression or of semi-coherent schemes leads to substantial\nperformance gains compared to more conventional approaches based on\nnon-coherent transmission or the CFE approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Jun 2013 18:08:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Oct 2013 11:01:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-24"}

He remarks that changing the sign of the self-force\neliminates the runaway solutions and gives `reasonable behaviour'. Dirac\nrejects such a change and proceeds with an ad hoc modification to the solutions\nof the initial value problem that is not consistent with the principle of\ncausality. We argue that his reasons for rejecting the change of sign are\ninvalid on both physical and mathematical grounds.\n  The conceptual shift is to treat the physical particle as a composite of the\nsource particle and the energy-momentum that is reversibly generated in its\nself-field by its motion. The reversibly generated energy in the self-field is\ninterpreted as kinetic energy, and the changes that follow result in Dirac's\nchange of sign. Several exact solutions to the new equation of motion and its\nlinearisation are given. For a particle in orbital motion the self-force\nenables the applied force to generate radiation and kinetic energy in the\nself-field that results in an outward spiral motion.

Currently used classical\ndigital signature schemes rely on public key encryption techniques, where the\ncomplexity of so-called \"one-way\" mathematical functions is used to provide\nsecurity over sufficiently long timescales. No mathematical proofs are known\nfor the long-term security of such techniques. Quantum digital signatures offer\na means of sending a message which cannot be forged or repudiated, with\nsecurity verified by information-theoretical limits and quantum mechanics. Here\nwe demonstrate an experimental system which distributes quantum signatures from\none sender to two receivers and enables message sending ensured against forging\nand repudiation. Additionally, we analyse the security of the system in some\ntypical scenarios. The system is based on the interference of phase encoded\ncoherent states of light and our implementation utilises polarisation\nmaintaining optical fibre and photons with a wavelength of 850 nm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Jun 2013 19:03:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-05"}

GRB 110918A gave rise to a luminous afterglow\nwith an intrinsic spectral slope of b=0.70, which probed a sight-line with\nlittle extinction (A_V=0.16 mag) typical of the established distributions of\nafterglow properties.

The purpose of this study is to build a predictor to realize\npredictions of ozone and PM10 at horizon d+1 in Corsica in order to be able to\nanticipate pollution peak formation and to take appropriated prevention\nmeasures. Specific meteorological conditions are known to lead to particular\npollution event in Corsica (e.g. Saharan dust event). Therefore, several ANN\nmodels will be used, for meteorological conditions clustering and for\noperational forecasting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Jun 2013 18:42:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-06"}

In this work, we explore the hitherto neglected effects of cosmic ray\nmodulation by both stellar winds and magnetic field structures and study how\nthese processes act to reduce disk ionization rates. We construct a\ntwo-dimensional protoplanetary disk model of a T-Tauri star system, focusing on\nionization from stellar and interstellar FUV, stellar X-ray photons, and cosmic\nrays.

We\npresent Chandra observations for four new GALEX-selected LBAs. Including\npreviously studied LBAs, Haro 11 and VV 114, we find that LBAs demonstrate\nL_X/SFR ratios that are elevated by ~1.5sigma compared to local galaxies,\nsimilar to the ratios found for stacked LBGs in the early Universe (z>2).

Since both LBAs and LBGs have lower dust attenuations and\nmetallicities compared to similar samples of more typical local galaxies, we\ninvestigate the effects of dust extinction and metallicity on the L_X/SFR for\nthe broader population of galaxies with high sSFRs (>10^{-10}/yr).

The jet of the central AGN is therefore either precessing or\nsloshing-induced motions have caused the outflows to change directions. There\nare also hints of an X-ray depression to the north aligned with the 325 MHz\njet-like structure, which might represent the highest redshift ghost cavity\ndiscovered to date.

The common location of the cold front with the edge of the\nradio mini-halo supports the idea that the latter originates from electrons\nbeing reaccelerated due to sloshing induced turbulence. Alternatively, its\ncoexistence with the edge of the X-ray cavity may be due to cool gas being\ndragged out by the outburst.

Data from CR observations are yet inconclusive\nabout their exact location or distribution, but provide a measure for the\naverage local density of these emitters. Due to the discreteness of the\nemitters the flux is expected to show ensemble fluctuations on top of the\nstatistical variations, a reflection of the cosmic variance. This effect is\nstrongest for the most energetic cosmic rays due to the limited propagation\ndistance in the cosmic radiation background and is hence a local phenomenon. In\nthis work we study the sensitivity of the JEM-EUSO space mission to ensemble\nfluctuations on the assumption of uniform distribution of sources, with local\nsource density \\sim 10^{-5} Mpc^{-3}. We show that in 3 years of observation\nJEM-EUSO will be able to probe ensemble fluctuations if the nearest sources are\nat 3 Mpc, and that after 10 years orbiting the Earth, this pathfinder mission\nwill become sensitive to ensemble fluctuations if the nearest sources are 10\nMpc away. The study of spectral fluctuations from the local source\ndistributions are complementary to but independent of cosmic ray anisotropy\nstudies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Jun 2013 20:01:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-06"}

We review the current observational and theoretical status of these\n\"small scale controversies.\" Cosmological simulations that incorporate only\ngravity and collisionless CDM predict halos with abundant substructure and\ncentral densities that are too high to match constraints from galaxy dynamics.\nThe solution could lie in baryonic physics: recent numerical simulations and\nanalytic models suggest that gravitational potential fluctuations tied to\nefficient supernova feedback can flatten the central cusps of halos in massive\ngalaxies, and a combination of feedback and low star-formation efficiency could\nexplain why most of the dark matter subhalos orbiting the Milky Way do not host\nvisible galaxies. However, it is not clear that this solution can work in the\nlowest mass galaxies where discrepancies are observed. Alternatively, the\nsmall-scale conflicts could be evidence of more complex physics in the dark\nsector itself. For example, elastic scattering from strong dark matter\nself-interactions can alter predicted halo mass profiles, leading to good\nagreement with observations across a wide range of galaxy mass. Gravitational\nlensing and dynamical perturbations of tidal streams in the stellar halo\nprovide evidence for an abundant population of low mass subhalos in accord with\nCDM predictions. These observational approaches will get more powerful over the\nnext few years.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Jun 2013 20:03:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-07"}

This is called the three-level ansatz and is the only\nunproven assumption in the theory of fundamental limits. All calculations that\nare based on direct solution of the Schrodinger equation yield intrinsic\nhyperpolarizabilities less than 0.709 and intrinsic second\nhyperpolarizabilities less than 0.6. In this work, we show that relaxing the\nthree-level ansatz and allowing an arbitrary number of states to contribute\nleads to divergence of the optimized intrinsic hyperpolarizability in the limit\nof an infinite number of states - what we call the many-state catastrophe. This\nis not surprising given that the divergent systems are most likely not\nderivable from the Schrodinger equation, yet obey the sum rules. The sums rules\nare the second ingredient in limit theory, and apply also to systems with more\ngeneral Hamiltonians. These exotic Hamiltonians may not model any real systems\nfound in nature. Indeed, a class of transition moments and energies that come\nform the sum rules do not have a corresponding Hamiltonian that is expressible\nin differential form. In this work, we show that the three-level ansatz acts as\na constraint that excludes many of the nonphysical Hamiltonians and prevents\nthe intrinsic hyperpolarizability from diverging. We argue that this implies\nthat the true fundamental limit is smaller than previously calculated. Since\nthe three-level ansatz does not lead to the largest possible nonlinear\nresponse, contrary to its assertion, we propose the intriguing possibility that\nthe three-level ansatz is true for any system that obeys the Schrodinger\nequation, yet this assertion may be unprovable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Jun 2013 22:23:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-04"}

The empirical findings present an industry in\ntransformation.In the first place, we observe a decline of the total number of\npublications by large firms. Second, we show a relative increase of their\nexternal collaborations suggesting a tendency to outsource, and a\ndiversification of the disciplinary base, in particular towards computation,\nhealth services and more clinical approaches. Also evident is a more pronounced\ndecline in publications by both R&D laboratories located in Europe and by firms\nwith European headquarters. Finally, while publications by Big Pharma in\nemerging economies sharply increase, they remain extremely low compared with\nthose in developed countries. In summary, the trend in this transformation is\none of a gradual decrease in internal research efforts and increasing reliance\non external research. These empirical insights support the view that large\npharmaceutical firms are increasingly becoming networks integrators rather than\nthe prime locus of drug discovery.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Jun 2013 00:02:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-06"}

The main aim of this\nstudy is to examine chemical similarities and differences among metal-poor\nstars belonging to these old Galactic components as a clue to determine their\nearly chemodynamical evolution. In our previous paper, we obtained abundances\nof alpha elements by performing a one-dimensional LTE abundance analysis based\non the high-resolution (R~50000) spectra obtained with the Subaru/HDS. In this\npaper, a similar analysis is performed to determine abundances of an additional\n17 elements. We show that, in metallicities below [Fe/H]~-2, the abundance\nratios of many elements in the thick disk, inner halo, and outer halo\nsubsamples are largely similar. In contrast, in higher metallicities\n([Fe/H]>-1.5), differences in some of the abundance ratios among the three\nsubsamples are identified. Specifically, the [Na/Fe], [Ni/Fe], [Cu/Fe], and\n[Zn/Fe] ratios in the inner and outer halo subsamples are found to be lower\nthan those in the thick disk subsample. In contrast to what was observed for\n[Mg/Fe] in our previous paper, [Eu/Fe] ratios are more enhanced in the two halo\nsubsamples rather than in the thick disk subsample. The observed distinct\nchemical abundances of some elements between the thick disk and inner/outer\nhalo subsamples with [Fe/H]>-1.5 support the hypothesis that these components\nformed through different mechanisms. In particular, our results favor the\nscenario that the inner and outer halo components formed through an assembly of\nmultiple progenitor systems that experienced various degrees of chemical\nenrichments, while the thick disk formed through rapid star formation with an\nefficient mixing of chemical elements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Jun 2013 01:23:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

The star Fomalhaut harbors a cold debris belt at 140 AU as\nwell as evidence of a warm dust component, which is suspected of being a bright\nanalog to the solar system's zodiacal dust.\n  Interferometric observations obtained with the VLTI and the KIN have\nidentified near- and mid-infrared excesses attributed to hot and warm\nexozodiacal dust in the inner few AU of the star.\n  We performed parametric modeling of the exozodiacal disk using the GRaTeR\nradiative transfer code to reproduce the interferometric data, complemented by\nmid- to far-infrared measurements. A detailed treatment of sublimation\ntemperatures was introduced to explore the hot population at the sublimation\nrim. We then used an analytical approach to successively testing several source\nmechanisms.\n  A good fit to the data is found by two distinct dust populations: (1) very\nsmall, hence unbound, hot dust grains confined in a narrow region at the\nsublimation rim of carbonaceous material; (2) bound grains at 2 AU that are\nprotected from sublimation and have a higher mass despite their fainter flux\nlevel. We propose that the hot dust is produced by the release of small carbon\ngrains following the disruption of aggregates that originate from the warm\ncomponent. A mechanism, such as gas braking, is required to further confine the\nsmall grains for a long enough time. In situ dust production could hardly be\nensured for the age of the star, so the observed amount of dust must be\ntriggered by intense dynamical activity.\n  Fomalhaut may be representative of exozodis that are currently being surveyed\nworldwide. We propose a framework for reconciling the hot exozodi phenomenon\nwith theoretical constraints: the hot component of Fomalhaut is likely the tip\nof the iceberg since it could originate from a warm counterpart residing near\nthe ice line.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Jun 2013 01:28:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

To meet the\npractical requirement that energy receivers (ERs) operate with much higher\nreceived power than information receivers (IRs), ERs need to be deployed closer\nto the transmitter than IRs. However, due to the broadcast nature of wireless\nchannels, one critical issue is that the messages sent to IRs cannot be\neavesdropped by ERs, which possess better channels from the transmitter. In\nthis paper, we address this new secrecy communication problem in a multiuser\nmultiple-input single-output (MISO) SWIPT system where a multi-antenna\ntransmitter sends information and energy simultaneously to one IR and multiple\nERs, each with a single antenna. By optimizing transmit beamforming vectors and\ntheir power allocation, we maximize the weighted sum-energy transferred to ERs\nsubject to a secrecy rate constraint for the information sent to the IR. We\nsolve this non-convex problem optimally by reformulating it into a two-stage\nproblem. First, we fix the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at\nthe IR and obtain the optimal beamforming solution by applying the technique of\nsemidefinite relaxation (SDR). Then the original problem is solved by a\none-dimension search over the optimal SINR value for the IR. Furthermore, two\nsuboptimal low-complexity beamforming schemes are proposed, and their\nachievable (secrecy) rate-energy (R-E) regions are compared against that by the\noptimal scheme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Jun 2013 03:07:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Jul 2013 09:50:46 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 31 Jul 2013 02:07:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

In this paper, we formulate this task as a\nBayesian inference problem and propose a distributed inference framework in\nwhich the posterior distribution of labeling variable corresponding to each\nobservation, conditioned on all history appearance and spatio-temporal evidence\nmade in the whole networks, is calculated based solely on local information\nprocessing on each camera and mutual information exchanging between neighboring\ncameras.

This feature makes our method very flexible and competitive when\nobserving condition undergoes large changes across camera views. To cope with\nthe problem of missing detection, which is critical for distributed inference,\nwe consider an enlarged neighborhood of each camera during inference and use a\nmixture model to describe the higher order spatio-temporal constraints.

Several works suggest that\nthis dynamical instability occurred `late', long after all the planets had\nformed and the solar nebula had dissipated. Assuming that the terrestrial\nplanets had already formed, then their orbits would have been affected by the\nmigration of the giant planets. As a result, how did the orbits of the\nterrestrial planets change? And can we use this migration to obtain information\non the primordial orbits of the terrestrial planets?

We show that the\ncoefficients of the logarithms coming from different boundary conditions can be\nreduced to just two different universal coefficients. We also study the effect\nof the mass and temperature on the entanglement entropy of the system in\ndifferent situations. The universality of our results is also confirmed by\nchanging different parameters in the coupled harmonic oscillators. We also show\nthat more general interactions coming from general singular Toeplitz matrices\ncan be decomposed to our long-range harmonic oscillators. Despite the\nlong-range nature of the couplings we show that the area law is valid in two\ndimensions and the universal logarithmic terms appear if we consider subregions\nwith sharp corners. Finally we study analytically different aspects of the\nmutual information such as its logarithmic dependence to the subsystem, effect\nof mass and influence of the boundary. We also generalize our results in this\ncase to general singular Toeplitz matrices and higher dimensions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Jun 2013 04:54:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 Jul 2013 14:09:05 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 18 Jul 2013 04:27:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-19"}

This, in addition to the absorption at the host redshift\nand the other two intervening absorbers, takes the total to four (possibly\nfive). The previous maximum number of 21-cm absorbers detected along a single\nsight-line is two and so we suspect that this number of gas-rich absorbers is\nin some way related to the very red colour of the background source. Despite\nthis, no molecular gas (through OH absorption) has yet been detected at any of\nthe 21-cm redshifts, although, from the population of 21-cm absorbers as a\nwhole, there is evidence for a weak correlation between the atomic line\nstrength and the optical--near-infrared colour. In either case, the fact that\nso many gas-rich galaxies (likely to be damped Lyman-alpha absorption systems)\nhave been found along a single sight-line towards a highly obscured source may\nhave far reaching implications for the population of faint galaxies not\ndetected in optical surveys, a possibility which could be addressed through\nfuture wide-field absorption line surveys with the Square Kilometre Array.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Jun 2013 05:07:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

By constructing the\nfractional deviation maps at various positions in the space of microlensing\nparameters, we find that the pattern of the fractional deviation depends on the\nratio of the source radius to the caustic size, and the ratio satisfying the\nobservational threshold varies with the star-planet separation.

It is shown that this relation further leads one to a\nsimple analytic condition for the star-planet separation to detect the\nboundness of wide-separation planets as a function of the mass ratio and the\nsource radius. For example, when 5% of the detection threshold is assumed, for\na source star with the radius of ~1 R_sun, an Earth-mass planet and a\nJupiter-mass planet can be recognized of its boundness when it is within the\nseparation range of ~10 AU and ~30 AU, respectively.

To do so, we generalise differential privacy to arbitrary dataset\nmetrics, outcome spaces and distribution families. This allows us to also deal\nwith non-i.i.d or non-tabular datasets.

However, this assumption seems invalid in BLR models that\nconsists of an accretion disk and its wind. The disk is likely Keplerian and\ntherefore virialized. However, the wind material must, beyond a certain point,\nbe dominated by an outward force that is stronger than gravity. Here, we\nanalyze hydrodynamic simulations of four different disk winds: an isothermal\nwind, a thermal wind from an X-ray heated disk, and two line-driven winds, one\nwith and the other without X-ray heating and cooling. For each model, we check\nwhether gravity governs the flow properties, by computing and analyzing the\nvolume-integrated quantities that appear in the virial theorem: internal,\nkinetic, and gravitational energies, We find that in the first two models, the\nwinds are non-virialized whereas the two line-driven disk winds are virialized\nup to a relatively large distance. The line-driven winds are virialized because\nthey accelerate slowly so that the rotational velocity is dominant and the wind\nbase is very dense. For the two virialized winds, the so-called projected\nvirial factor scales with inclination angle as $1/ \\sin^2{i}$. Finally, we\ndemonstrate that an outflow from a Keplerian disk becomes unvirialized more\nslowly when it conserves the gas specific angular momentum -- as in the models\nconsidered here, than when it conserves the angular velocity -- as in the\nso-called magneto-centrifugal winds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Jun 2013 13:00:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 29 Sep 2013 22:07:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

The circumstellar disks ejected by many rapidly rotating B stars\n(so-called Be stars) offer the rare opportunity of studying the structure and\ndynamics of gaseous disks at high spectral as well as angular resolution.

Methods. The origin of this effect (dubbed\ncentral quasi-emission phase signature, CQE-PS) lies in the velocity-dependent\nline absorption of photospheric radiation by the circumstellar disk. At high\nspectral and marginal interferometric resolution, photocenter displacements\nbetween star and isovelocity regions in the Keplerian disk reveal themselves\nthrough small interferometric phase shifts. To investigate the diagnostic\npotential of this effect, a series of models are presented, based on detailed\nradiative transfer calculations in a viscous decretion disk. Results. Amplitude\nand detailed shape of the CQE-PS depend sensitively on disk density and size\nand on the radial distribution of the material with characteristic shapes in\ndifferential phase diagrams. In addition, useful lower limits to the angular\nsize of the central stars can be derived even when the system is almost\nunresolved. Conclusions. The full power of this diagnostic tool can be expected\nif it can be applied to observations over a full life-cycle of a disk from\nfirst ejection through final dispersal, over a full cycle of disk oscillations,\nor over a full orbital period in a binary system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Jun 2013 13:37:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-06"}

In contrast with the standard\nsuperfield approach in which unbroken supersymmetry plays the leading role, we\nhave shifted the attention to the spontaneously broken supersymmetry. It turns\nout that in the theories in which half of supersymmetries is spontaneously\nbroken, all physical fermions are just the fermions of the nonlinear\nrealization. Moreover, the transformation properties of these fermions with\nrespect to the broken supersymmetry are the same as in the famous Volkov-Akulov\nmodel. Just this fact completely fixed all possible appearances of the fermions\nin the component action: they can enter the action through the determinant of\nthe vielbein (to compensate the transformation of the volume form) and the\ncovariant derivatives, only. It is very important that in our parametrization\nof the coset the rest of physical components, i.e. all bosonic components,\ntransform as ``matter fields'' with respect to the broken supersymmetry.\nClearly, in such a situation the component action acquires the form of the\nVolkov-Akulov action for these ``matter fields''. The complete form of the\naction can be further fixed by two additional requirements: a) to reproduce the\nbosonic limit, which is explicitly known in many interesting cases, and b) to\nhave a proper linearized form, which has to be invariant with respect to the\nlinearized unbroken supersymmetry. We supply the general consideration by a\ndetailed example of the component action of $N=1$ supermembrane in $D=4$\nconstructed within our procedure. In this case we provide the exact proof of\nthe invariance of the constructed component action with respect to both, broken\nand unbroken supersymmetries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Jun 2013 14:22:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

The\ndetection of these LBGs in the FIR indicates that they have a dust content high\nenough so that its emission can be directly detected. According to a spectral\nenergy distribution (SED) fitting with stellar population templates to their\nUV-to-near-IR observed photometry, PACS-detected LBGs tend to be bigger, more\nmassive, dustier, redder in the UV continuum, and UV-brighter than\nPACS-undetected LBGs. PACS-detected LBGs at z ~ 1 are mostly disk-like galaxies\nand are located over the green-valley and red sequence of the color-magnitude\ndiagram of galaxies at their redshift. By using their UV and IR emission, we\nfind that PACS-detected LBGs tend to be less dusty and have slightly higher\ntotal star-formation rates (SFRs) than other PACS-detected UV-selected galaxies\nwithin their same redshift range. As a consequence of the selection effect due\nto the depth of the FIR observations employed, all our PACS-detected LBGs are\nLIRGs. However, none of them are in the ULIRG regime, where the FIR\nobservations are complete. The finding of ULIRGs-LBGs at higher redshifts\nsuggests an evolution of the FIR emission of LBGs with cosmic time. In an\nIRX-$\\beta$ diagram, PACS-detected LBGs at z ~ 1 tend to be located around the\nrelation for local starburst similarly to other UV-selected PACS-detected\ngalaxies at their same redshift. Consequently, the dust-correction factors\nobtained with their UV continuum slope allow to determine their total SFR,\nunlike at higher redshifts. However, the dust attenuation derived from UV to\nNIR SED fitting overestimates the total SFR for most of our PACS-detected LBGs\nin age-dependent way: the overestimation factor is higher in younger galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Jun 2013 14:40:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 Jul 2013 08:38:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

Based primarily on the SINFONI kinematics,\nten black hole masses occupying the high-mass regime of the M_BH-sigma relation\nare derived using three-integral Schwarzschild models. The effect of dark\nmatter inclusion on the black hole mass is explored. The omission of a dark\nmatter halo in the model results in a higher stellar mass-to-light ratio,\nespecially when extensive kinematic data are used in the model. However, when\nthe diameter of the sphere of influence -- computed using the black hole mass\nderived without a dark halo -- is at least 10 times the PSF FWHM during the\nobservations, it is safe to exclude a dark matter component in the dynamical\nmodeling, i.e. the change in black hole mass is negligible.

This freely-available code is called epi_int, and\nit is distinct from other such codes in its use of streamlines to calculate the\neffects of ring self-gravity. The great advantage of this approach is that the\nperturbing forces arise from smooth wires of ring matter rather than discreet\nparticles, so there is very little gravitational scattering and so only a\nmodest number of particles are needed to simulate, say, the scalloped edge of a\nresonantly confined ring or the propagation of spiral density waves.\n  The code is applied to the outer edge of Saturn's B ring, and a comparison of\nCassini measurements of the ring's forced response to simulations of Mimas'\nresonant perturbations reveals that the B ring's surface density at its outer\nedge is 195+-60 gm/cm^2 which, if the same everywhere across the ring would\nmean that the B ring's mass is about 90% of Mimas' mass.\n  Cassini observations show that the B ring-edge has several free normal modes,\nwhich are long-lived disturbances of the ring-edge that are not driven by any\nknown satellite resonances. Although the mechanism that excites or sustains\nthese normal modes is unknown, we can plant such a disturbance at a simulated\nring's edge, and find that these modes persist without any damping for more\nthan ~10^5 orbits or ~100 yrs despite the simulated ring's viscosity of 100\ncm^2/sec. These simulations also indicate that impulsive disturbances at a ring\ncan excite long-lived normal modes, which suggests that an impact in the recent\npast by perhaps a cloud of cometary debris might have excited these\ndisturbances which are quite common to many of Saturn's sharp-edged rings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Jun 2013 15:13:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 6 Jun 2013 02:56:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

Everything is proven\nexplicitly in a very elementary level step by step approach. The paper is thus\nintended to serve as reference material, providing a number of details, which\nare usually skipped in more advanced discussions of the subject matter. The\narrangement of the material closely follows {chapter 2 of D. Hestenes, G.\nSobczyk, Clifford Algebra to Geometric Calculus, Kluwer, Dordrecht, 1999}.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Jun 2013 01:17:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-11"}

Rev. A, 49, 678, 1994), and then by Rueda and Haisch following a\ntotally different and more satisfactory approach (Found. Phys., 28, 1057, 1998;\nPhys. Letters A, 240, 115, 1998; Annalen der Physik, 10 (5), 393, 2001). In the\npresent paper, the approach taken by Rueda and Haisch will be followed, but the\nanalysis will be done within a formulation that uses nonrelativistic quantum\nelectrodynamics with the creation and annihilation operators rather than the\napproach of Rueda and Haisch using stochastic electrodynamics. We analyze the\ninteraction between the zero-point field and an object under hyperbolic motion\n(constant proper acceleration), and find that there arises a reaction force\nwhich is proportional in magnitude, and opposite in direction, to the\nacceleration. This is suggestive of what we know as inertia. We also point out\nthat the equivalence principle -- that inertial mass and gravitational mass\nhave the same values -- follows naturally using this approach. Inertial mass\nand gravitational mass are not merely equal, they are the identical thing\nviewed from two complementary perspectives (Annalen der Physik, 14 (8), 479,\n2005). In the first case an object accelerating through the electromagnetic\nzero-point field experiences resistance from the field. In the case of an\nobject held fixed in a gravitational field, the electromagnetic zero-point\nfield propagates on curved geodesics, in effect accelerating with respect to\nthe fixed object, thereby generating weight. Hence, the equivalence principle\ndoes not need to be independently postulated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Jun 2013 17:01:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-26"}

He has adopted the mathematical approach\nfrom his experience at solving the Navier Stokes equations in fluid mechanics\nusing invariance of an arbitrary function under a group of conformal\ntransformations. However, this esoteric approach resulted in a sound\nmathematical formulation for the modelling philosophy of his theorem which is\nthat since the fundamental characteristic of the universe is motion and motion\ncan only be provided by force, then the universe could be viewed as a large\nforce field. He then represented the conservation of this large force field at\na given space time point in the universe by a set of generic equations from\nwhich he obtained his generic solutions whose specific applications depend on\nthe initial/boundary conditions and other physical constraint conditions. An\nimportant achievement of the theorem methodology is that modelling with it is\nreduced to algebraic operations rather than differential equations for the most\nparts in previous methodologies. With this understanding from pedagogically\nstudying the modelling philosophy and mathematics of the theorem, we have been\nable to recover from it simple standard equations such as in the Fermat\nprinciple for geometric optics. This is encouraging and therefore supports the\npossibility to recover more results and also to provide new ones, thereby\nsupporting the theorem as a potential candidate for a grand unification theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Jun 2013 01:23:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-04"}

By using the\nlanguage of mathematics and logic, we define what we call everlasting\nsocieties. Everlasting societies never age: persons never age, and the goods of\nthe society are indestructible. The infinite history of an everlasting society\nunfolds by following deterministic and probabilistic laws that do their best to\nsatisfy the free will of all the persons of the society.\n  We define three possible kinds of histories for everlasting societies:\nprimitive histories, good histories, and golden histories. In primitive\nhistories, persons are inherently selfish, and they use their free will to\nobtain the personal ownerships of all the goods of the society. In good\nhistories, persons are inherently good, and they use their free will to\ndistribute the goods of the society. In good histories, a person is not only\nable to desire the personal ownership of goods, but is also able to desire that\na good be owned by another person. In golden histories, free will is bound by\nthe ethic of reciprocity, which states that \"you should wish upon others as you\nwould like others to wish upon yourself\". In golden societies, the ethic of\nreciprocity becomes a law that partially binds free will, and that must be\nabided at all times. In other words, the verb \"should\" becomes the verb \"must\".\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Jun 2013 10:27:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-05"}
