Four types of negative electrodes with equal\narea (0.09 cm2) but different shape (round, oval, square, and triangular) are\nevaluated with respect to short-circuit current density, open-circuit voltage,\nfill factor, and power conversion efficiency of PSCs. The results show that the\ndevice with round electrodes gives the best photovoltaic performance; in\ncontrast, the device with triangular electrodes reveals the worst properties.\nMaximum almost twice increase in PCE with round electrode is obtained in the\ndevices compared with that of the triangular electrode. As a conclusion, the\nelectrode boundary curvature has a strong influence on the performance of PSCs.\nThe larger curvature, i.e. the sharper electrodes edge, maybe is a negative\neffector on exciton separation and carrier transport in PSC system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Jun 2013 16:10:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 Jul 2013 07:50:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

In this paper we unclose the observed deviations of the\nprecessing radio jets of SS\\,433, within a few arcseconds from a jets source,\nfrom the ballistic track, described by the kinematic model, as a signature of\nthe deceleration which, on other hand, issues from the jets colliding with\nambient medium.

We have found that to fit observed\nlocus the radio jets should be decelerated and twisted, additionally to the\nprecession twist, mostly within the first one-fifth of precession period, and\nfurther they extend imitating ballistic jets. The fitted physical parameters of\nthe jet model turned out to be physically reliable and characteristic for\nSS\\,433 jets that unlikely to be occasional.

Alternatively, in \"gradual\" SEP\nevents, shock waves, driven out from the Sun by coronal mass ejections (CMEs),\nmore democratically sample ion abundances that are even used to measure the\ncoronal abundances of the elements. Sometimes residual impulsive suprathermal\nions contribute to the seed population for shock acceleration, complicating the\nabundance picture, but this process has now been modeled theoretically.\nInitially, impulsive events define a point source on the Sun, selectively\nfilling few magnetic flux tubes, while gradual events show broad acceleration\nthat can fill half of the inner heliosphere, beginning when the shock reaches\n~2 solar radii. Shock acceleration occurs as ions are scattered back and forth\nacross the shock by resonant Alfven waves amplified by the accelerated protons\nthemselves. These waves also can produce a streaming-limited maximum SEP\nintensity and plateau region upstream of the shock. Behind the shock lies the\nlarge expanse of the \"reservoir\", a spatially extensive trapped volume of\nuniform SEP intensities with invariant energy-spectral shapes where overall\nintensities decrease with time as the enclosing \"magnetic bottle\" expands\nadiabatically. These reservoirs now explain the slow intensity decrease that\ndefines gradual events, once erroneously attributed solely to slow outward\ndiffusion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Jun 2013 21:44:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-18"}

No significant excesses are\nfound for nitrogen and neutron-capture elements (the latter of which place it\nin the CEMP-no class of stars). Other elements that we measure exhibit\nabundance patterns that are typical for non-CEMP extremely metal-poor stars. No\nevidence for variations of radial velocity have been found for this star.

Blue\nMesa Reservoir contains recreationally important populations of lake trout\n(Salvelinus namaycush), kokanee salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka), rainbow trout\n(Onocorhynchus mykiss), and brown trout (Salmo trutta). A management challenge\nin recent years has been the overpopulation of lake trout, which has led to a\nsteep decline in abundance of kokanee salmon (a preferred food source) followed\nby a steep decline in body condition of the lake trout. Relative weight, Wr, is\ncommonly used to assess body condition and prey availability of fish in a\nvariety of ecosystems, but its seasonal variability has not been well\ndocumented in cold water species. Relative weight is 100 times the actual\nweight of a fish divided by expected weight (or standard weight) of that\nspecies at the measured total length. The present study uses multi-year,\nmulti-season length and weight data provided by the Colorado Department of\nParks and Wildlife to quantify seasonal variations in mean relative weight in\nthese four species. It is found that lake trout consistently lose significant\nbody condition between the spring and the fall of a given year, with a mean\nloss in relative weight of 11.7 +/- 2.4.

In interpreting\nthese measurements, the simplifying assumption that waves propagate through a\ntemporally stationary medium is almost universally invoked. However, the Sun is\nin a constant state of evolution, on a broad range of spatio-temporal scales.\nAt the zero wavelength limit, i.e., when the wavelength is much shorter than\nthe scale over which the medium varies, the WKBJ (ray) approximation may be\napplied. Here, we address the other asymptotic end of the spectrum, the\ninfinite wavelength limit, using the technique of homogenization. We apply\nhomogenization to scenarios where waves are propagating through rapidly varying\nmedia (spatially and temporally), and derive effective models for the media.\nOne consequence is that a scalar sound speed becomes a tensorial wavespeed in\nthe effective model and anisotropies can be induced depending on the nature of\nthe perturbation. The second term in this asymptotic two-scale expansion, the\nso-called corrector, contains contributions due to higher-order scattering,\nleading to the decoherence of the wavefield. This decoherence may be causally\nlinked to the observed wave attenuation in the Sun. Although the examples we\nconsider here consist of periodic arrays of perturbations to the background,\nhomogenization may be extended to ergodic and stationary random media. This\nmethod may have broad implications for the manner in which we interpret seismic\nmeasurements in the Sun and for modeling the effects of granulation on the\nscattering of waves and distortion of normal-mode eigenfunctions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Jun 2013 02:40:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

For a 2D harmonic trap, the order of fluctuations is\n$n^{-1/2}(\\log n)^{1/2}$, which is larger than $n^{-1/2}$ but the limiting\ndistribution is still normal. All of these results come as easy consequences of\na general theorem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Jun 2013 04:37:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 Jul 2013 00:20:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 19 Aug 2013 17:42:06 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 14 Jan 2014 18:52:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-05"}

The richer\ninformation content of Betti numbers goes along the availability of fast\nalgorithms to compute them.\n  For continuous density fields, we determine the scale-dependence of Betti\nnumbers by invoking the cosmologically familiar filtration of sublevel or\nsuperlevel sets defined by density thresholds. For the discrete galaxy\ndistribution, however, the analysis is based on the alpha shapes of the\nparticles. These simplicial complexes constitute an ordered sequence of nested\nsubsets of the Delaunay tessellation, a filtration defined by the scale\nparameter, $\\alpha$. As they are homotopy equivalent to the sublevel sets of\nthe distance field, they are an excellent tool for assessing the topological\nstructure of a discrete point distribution. In order to develop an intuitive\nunderstanding for the behavior of Betti numbers as a function of $\\alpha$, and\ntheir relation to the morphological patterns in the Cosmic Web, we first study\nthem within the context of simple heuristic Voronoi clustering models.\n  Subsequently, we address the topology of structures emerging in the standard\nLCDM scenario and in cosmological scenarios with alternative dark energy\ncontent. The evolution and scale-dependence of the Betti numbers is shown to\nreflect the hierarchical evolution of the Cosmic Web and yields a promising\nmeasure of cosmological parameters.

We are required to decide\nwhether there exists a \\emph{plan} -- an assignment of tasks to authorized\nusers -- such that all constraints are satisfied. Several bespoke algorithms\nhave been constructed for solving the WSP, optimised to deal with constraints\n(business rules) of particular types.\n  It is natural to see the WSP as a subclass of the {\\em Constraint\nSatisfaction Problem (CSP)} in which the variables are tasks and the domain is\nthe set of users. What makes the WSP distinctive as a CSP is that we can assume\nthat the number of tasks is very small compared to the number of users. This is\nin sharp contrast with traditional CSP models where the domain is small and the\nnumber of variables is very large. As such, it is appropriate to ask for which\nconstraint languages the WSP is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT), parameterized\nby the number of tasks. We have identified a new FPT constraint language,\nuser-independent constraint, that includes many of the constraints of interest\nin business processing systems.

On\nan example circuit, the computational cost measured in T gates executed by the\nclient is 97 times more than performing the original computation directly,\nwithout using the server, even before applying error correction. (The client\nstill benefits due to drastically reduced memory requirements.) Broadbent et\nal. proposed running error correction over blind computation, but our first\nprotocol applies one layer of Steane's [[7,1,3]] code underneath instead. This\nprotocol has better fault tolerance, but still results in a substantial\noverhead. We propose another protocol to reduce the client's computational load\nby transferring the qubit preparation to the server. For each logical qubit\nused in the computation, the client is only required to receive eight logical\nqubits via teleportation then buffer two logical qubits before returning one.\nThis protocol also protects the client's fault-tolerant preparation of logical\nqubits from a side-channel attack.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Jun 2013 14:22:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-23"}

This is achieved by utilizing the time-ergodicity, rather\nthan the sampling- (or ensemble-) ergodicity, of physical systems.\n  We introduce the formalism through a study of the Rabi model (a two level\nsystem coupled to an oscillator) and show that our semi-classical version\nexhibits, both qualitatively and quantitatively, many features of state\ntruncation and equilibration \\cite {AllahverdyanBN}. We then study the time\nevolution of two qubits in interaction with a bosonic environment, such that\nthe energy scale of one qubit is much larger, and that of the other much\nsmaller than the environment's energy scale. The small energy qubit decoheres\nto a mixture, while the high energy qubit is protected through the adiabatic\ntheorem. However, an inter-qubit coupling generates an overall decoherence and\nleads for some values of the coupling to long term revivals in the state\noccupations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Jun 2013 10:49:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-11"}

The periodic variations may be interpreted by a light-time\neffect caused by a low-mass star ($M_3\\ge0.09M_\\odot$).
