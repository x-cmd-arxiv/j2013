In most of the discussed models the interior of the disc is assumed to\nhave a turbulent viscosity and magnetic diffusivity (as described by two\n``alpha'' parameters), whereas the coronal region outside of the disc is\ntreated using ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD).\n  Extensive MHD simulations have established the occurrence of long-lasting\noutflows in both the cases of slowly and rapidly rotating stars. In the case of\n{\\it slowly rotating stars}, a new type of outflow, {\\it a conical wind}, is\nfound and studied in simulations. The conical winds appear in cases where the\nmagnetic flux of the star is bunched up by the inward motion of the accretion\ndisc. Near their region of origin, the winds have the shape of a thin conical\nshell with a half-opening angle of $ \\sim 30^\\circ$. At large distances these\noutflows become magnetically collimated by their toroidal magnetic field and\nform matter dominated jets. That is, the jets are current carrying. The\npredominant driving force for the conical winds is the magnetic force\nproportional to the negative gradient of the square of the toroidal magnetic\nfield and not the centrifugal force. In the case of {\\it rapidly rotating\nstars} in the ``propeller regime,'' a two-component outflow is observed. The\nfirst component is similar to the matter dominated conical winds. A large\nfraction of the disc matter may be ejected into the winds in this regime. The\nsecond component is a high-velocity, low-density magnetically dominated {\\it\naxial jet} where matter flows along the opened polar field lines of the star.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Jun 2013 16:14:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-06"}

However, it is still not\nwell-understood; for example, existence of solutions to the conformal equations\nfor zero or negative Yamabe metrics is still unknown without the so-called\n``CMC'' or ``near-CMC'' assumptions. The first existence results without such\nassumptions, termed the ``far-from-CMC'' case, were obtained by Holst, Nagy,\nand Tsogtgerel in 2008 for positive Yamabe metrics. However, their results are\nbased on topological arguments, and as a result solution uniqueness is not\nknown. Indeed, Maxwell gave evidence in 2011 that far-from-CMC solutions are\nnot unique in certain cases. In this article, we provide further insight by\nestablishing a type of alternative theorem for general far-from-CMC solutions.\nFor a given manifold M that admits a metric of positive scalar curvature and\nscalar flat metric g(0) with no conformal Killing fields, we first prove\nexistence of an analytic, one-parameter family of metrics g(z) through g(0)\nsuch that R(g(z)) = z. Using this family of metrics and given data\n(tau,sigma,rho,j), we form a one-parameter family of operators F((phi,w),z)\nwhose zeros satisfy the conformal equations. Applying Liapnuov-Schmidt\nreduction, we determine an analytic solution curve for F((phi,w),z) = 0 through\na critical point where the linearization of F((phi,w),z) vanishes. The\nregularity of this curve, the definition of F((phi,w),z), and the earlier\nfar-from-CMC results of Holst et al. allow us to then prove the following\nalternative theorem for far-from-CMC solutions: either (1) there exists a z_1\n>0 such that (positive Yamabe) solutions to the z_1-parameterized conformal\nequations are non-unique; or (2) there exists z_2 < 0 such that (negative\nYamabe) solutions to the z_2-parameterized conformal equations exist.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Jun 2013 19:12:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-10"}

We present a multi-wavelengths and multi-phase set of\nbenchmark values for the polarization signal of the integrated light from the\nplanet Earth derived from new polarimetric observations of the earthshine\nback-scattered from the Moon's dark side. Using a new, specially designed wide\nfield polarimeter we measured the fractional polarization of the earthshine in\nthe B, V, R and I filters for Earth phase angles alpha between 30{\\deg} and\n110{\\deg}. The phase dependence of the earthshine polarization is fitted by a\nfunction p x sin(alpha)^2. To determine the polarization of the planet Earth we\ncorrect our earthshine measurements by a polarization efficiency function for\nthe lunar surface derived from measurements of lunar samples from the\nliterature. The polarization of the earthshine decreases towards longer\nwavelengths and is about a factor 1.3 lower for the higher albedo highlands.\nFor mare regions the measured maximum polarization is about 13 % at quadrature\nin the B band. The resulting fractional polarizations for Earth are 24.6 % for\nthe B band, 19.1 % for the V band, 13.5 % for the R band, and 8.3 % for the I\nband. Together with literature values for the spectral reflectivity of Earth we\nobtain a contrast between the polarized flux of the Earth and the (total) flux\nof the Sun with an uncertainty of less than 20 % and we find that the best\nphase to detect an Earth twin is around an Earth phase alpha=65{\\deg}.

This information is accessible only through\ncomplex higher order moments or, in the worst case, becomes inaccessible to the\nhierarchy. The focus of this work is to investigate these transformations in\nthe framework of Fisher information using cosmological perturbation theory of\nthe matter field with Gaussian initial conditions.

This polynomial can be interpreted as the\nTaylor expansion of the maximally efficient \"sufficient\" observable in the\nnon-linear regime.

Remarkably, this optimal transform is essentially\nthe simple power transform with an exponent related to the slope of the power\nspectrum; when this is -1, it is indistinguishable from the logarithmic\ntransform. This transform Gaussianizes the distribution, and recovers the\nlinear density contrast. Thus a direct connection is revealed between undoing\nof the non-linear dynamics and the efficient capture of Fisher information.

Consequently,\nthey exhibit the Adler-Bell-Jackiw anomaly, which in this condensed matter\nrealization implies that application of parallel electric ($\\mathbf{E}$) and\nmagnetic ($\\mathbf{B}$) fields pumps electrons between nodes of opposite\nchirality at a rate proportional to $\\mathbf{E}\\cdot\\mathbf{B}$. We argue that\nthis pumping is measurable via nonlocal transport experiments, in the limit of\nweak internode scattering. Specifically, we show that as a consequence of the\nanomaly, applying a local magnetic field parallel to an injected current\ninduces a valley imbalance that diffuses over long distances. A probe magnetic\nfield can then convert this imbalance into a measurable voltage drop far from\nsource and drain.

One aspect of\nthis investigation involves identifying galaxies with disturbed morphologies\n(e.g., merging galaxies). This is often done by summarizing galaxy images\nusing, e.g., the CAS and Gini-M20 statistics of Conselice (2003) and Lotz et\nal.

We introduce three statistics that enhance detection of disturbed\nmorphologies at high-redshift (z ~ 2): the multi-mode (M), intensity (I), and\ndeviation (D) statistics. We show their effectiveness by training a\nmachine-learning classifier, random forest, using 1,639 galaxies observed in\nthe H band by the Hubble Space Telescope WFC3, galaxies that had been\npreviously classified by eye by the CANDELS collaboration (Grogin et al. 2011,\nKoekemoer et al. 2011). We find that the MID statistics (and the A statistic of\nConselice 2003) are the most useful for identifying disturbed morphologies.\n  We also explore whether human annotators are useful for identifying disturbed\nmorphologies. We demonstrate that they show limited ability to detect\ndisturbance at high redshift, and that increasing their number beyond\napproximately 10 does not provably yield better classification performance. We\npropose a simulation-based model-fitting algorithm that mitigates these issues\nby bypassing annotation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Jun 2013 20:02:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

These two symmetries are connected by fermionic\nsupercharges. The system includes an internal gauge connection 1-form $A$, a\nspin-1/2 Dirac spinor $\\psi$, the Lorentz connection $\\omega$, and the vielbein\n$e$. The connection one-form is in the adjoint representation of G, while\n$\\psi$ is in the fundamental. In contrast to standard supergravity, the metric\nis not a fundamental field and is in the center of the superalgebra: it is not\nonly invariant under the internal gauge group and under Lorentz\ntransformations, but is also invariant under supersymmetry. The features of\nthis theory that mark the difference with standard supersymmetry are: A) The\nnumber of fermionic and bosonic states is not necessarily the same; B) There\nare no superpartners with equal mass, \"bosoninos\", sleptons and squarks are\nabsent; C) Although this supersymmetry originates in a local gauge theory and\ngravity is included, there is no gravitino; D) Fermions acquire mass from their\ncoupling to the background or from self-couplings, while bosons remain\nmassless.

In 4D, the construction follows the Townsend - Mac\nDowell-Mansouri approach. Due to the absence of osp(4|2)-invariant traces in\nfour dimensions, the resulting Lagrangian is only invariant under [U(1) x\nSO(3,1)], and includes a Nambu--Jona-Lasinio term. In this case, the Lagrangian\ndepends on a single dimensionful parameter that fixes Newton's constant, the\ncosmological constant and the NJL coupling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Jun 2013 21:13:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 4 Jul 2014 03:39:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-07"}

The physical processes in which the structure is measured, i.e.\nelectron-meson scattering and semileptonic weak decays, are treated in a\nPoincar\\'e invariant way by making use of the point-form of relativistic\nquantum mechanics. The electromagnetic and weak meson currents are extracted\nfrom the 1-photon or 1-W-exchange amplitudes that result from a\nBakamjian-Thomas type mass operator for the respective systems. The covariant\ndecomposition of these currents provides the electromagnetic and weak\n(transition) form factors. The formalism is first applied to the study of\nheavy-light systems. Problems with cluster separability, which are inherent in\nthe Bakamjian-Thomas construction, are discussed and it is shown how to keep\nthem under control. It is proved that the heavy-quark limit of the electroweak\nform factors leads to one universal function, the Isgur-Wise function,\nconfirming that the requirements of heavy-quark symmetry are satisfied. These\nresults are discussed and compared with analogous calculations in the front\nform of dynamics.

The problem of how to\ntake into account retardation effects in the particle-exchange potential is\nformulated and it is shown how they affect the binding energy and wave-function\nsolution for a dynamical model of the deuteron.

As a result charged particles quickly lose their\nenergy developing an exponentially decaying energy distribution, which\nsuppresses the emission of high energy photons, thus reducing the number of\nelectron-positron pairs being generated. Therefore, this type of interaction\nsuppresses the development of the electromagnetic avalanche-type discharge,\ni.e., the exponential growth of the number of electrons, positrons, and photons\ndoes not occur in the course of interaction.

This paper\nintends to extend that work and aims to estimate the magnitude and significance\nof the aberration in proper motions of stars, especially in the region near the\nGalactic center. We adopt two models for the Galactic rotation curve to\nevaluate the aberrational effect on the Galactic plane. Based on the\ntheoretical developments, we show that the effect of aberration in proper\nmotions depends on the galactocentric distance of stars; it is dominated by the\nacceleration of stars in the central region of the Galaxy. Within 200 pc from\nthe Galactic center, the systematic proper motion can reach an amplitude larger\nthan 1000 uas/yr by applying a flat rotation curve. With a more realistic\nrotation curve which is linearly rising in the core region of the Galaxy, the\naberrational proper motions are limited up to about 150 uas/yr. Then we\ninvestigate the applicability of the theoretical expressions concerning the\naberrational proper motions, especially for those stars with short period\norbits. If the orbital period of stars is only a fraction of the light time\nfrom the star to the SSB, the expression proposed by Kovalevsky is not\nappropriate. With a more suitable formulation, we found that the aberration has\nno effect on the determination of the stellar orbits on the celestial sphere.\nThe aberrational effect under consideration is small but not negligible with\nhigh-accurate astrometry in the future, particularly in constructing the Gaia\ncelestial reference system realized by Galactic stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Jun 2013 02:41:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

In this paper, we\nsift through various capacity-impacting parameters and present a simple\nrelationship that can be used to estimate the capacity of both static and\nmobile networks.

Our result is valid for both finite networks and asymptotically\ninfinite networks. We then use this result to explain and better understand the\ninsights of some existing results on the capacity of static networks, mobile\nnetworks and hybrid networks and the multicast capacity. The capacity analysis\nusing the aforementioned relationship often becomes simpler.

However,\nthe use of very large antenna arrays brings new issues, such as the\nsignificantly increased hardware cost and signal processing cost and\ncomplexity. In order to reap the enormous gain of massive MIMO and yet reduce\nits cost to an affordable level, this paper proposes a novel system design by\nintegrating an electromagnetic (EM) lens with the large antenna array, termed\n\\emph{electromagnetic lens antenna} (ELA). An ELA has the capability of\nfocusing the power of any incident plane wave passing through the EM lens to a\nsmall subset of the antenna array, while the location of focal area is\ndependent on the angle of arrival (AoA) of the wave. As compared to\nconventional antenna arrays without the EM lens, the proposed system can\nsubstantially reduce the number of required radio frequency (RF) chains at the\nreceiver and hence, the implementation costs. In this paper, we investigate the\nproposed system under a simplified single-user uplink transmission setup, by\ncharacterizing the power distribution of the ELA as well as the resulting\nchannel model. Furthermore, by assuming antenna selection used at the receiver,\nwe show the throughput gains of the proposed system over conventional antenna\narrays given the same number of selected antennas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Jun 2013 06:51:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-07"}

The method works with\nthe adiabatic states and transforms the Hamiltonian to a form in which the\nterms responsible for decoherence and population relaxation are separated out.\nDecoherence is then accounted for non-perturbatively, and population relaxation\nusing a Markovian master equation. Analytical results can be obtained for the\nseven level system and the calculations are very simple for systems with more\nlevels. We apply the treatment to the seven level system and the results are in\nexcellent agreement with the exact numerical results of Nalbach et al. (P.\nNalbach, D. Braun, and M. Thorwart, Physical Review E, 84, 041926 (2011)). Our\napproach is able to account for decoherence and population relaxation\nseparately. It is found that decoherence only causes damping of oscillations,\nand does not lead to transfer to the reaction centre. Population relaxation is\nnecessary for efficient transfer to the reaction centre, in agreement with\nearlier findings. Our results show that the transformation to the adiabatic\nbasis followed by a Redfield type of approach leads to results in good\nagreement with exact simulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Jun 2013 07:11:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-07"}

The fate of the gainer once it reaches this\ncritical value is unclear. We investigate the orbital and stellar spin\nevolution in semi-detached binary systems, specifically for systems with\nrapidly rotating accretors. Our aim is to better distinguish between the\ndifferent spin-down mechanisms proposed which can consistently explain the slow\nrotation observed in Algols' final states and assess the degree of\nnon-conservatism due to the formation of a hotspot. We use our state-of-the-art\nbinary evolution code, Binstar, which incorporates a detailed treatment of the\norbital and stellar spin, including all torques due to mass transfer, the\ninteractions between a star and its accretion disc, tidal effects and magnetic\nbraking. We also present a new prescription for mass loss due to the formation\nof a hotspot based on energy conservation. The coupling between the star and\nthe disc via the boundary layer prevents the gainer from exceeding the critical\nrotation. Magnetic-field effects, although operating, are not the dominant\nspin-down mechanism for sensible field strengths. Spin down owing to tides is\n2-4 orders of magnitudes too weak to compensate the spinning-up torque due to\nmass accretion. Moreover, we find that the final separation strongly depends on\nthe spin-down mechanism. The formation of a hotspot leads to a large event of\nmass loss during the rapid phase of mass transfer. The degree of conservatism\nstrongly depends on the opacity of the impacted material. A statistical study\nas well as new observational constraints are needed to find the optimal set of\nparameters (magnetic-field strength, hotspot geometry,...) to reproduce Algol\nevolutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Jun 2013 09:19:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 Jul 2013 06:56:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

There are natural properties that require many queries to test,\nbut can be partitioned into a small number of subsets for which they are\npartially testable with very few queries.\n  We prove the existence of a property $P$ such that the only subsets $P'$ for\nwhich $P$ is $P'$-partially testable are very small. To prove this we introduce\nnew techniques for proving property testing lower bounds. In addition to\nobtaining some broad-brush criteria for non-testability, this implies a lower\nbound on the possibility of PCPPs with a sublinear proof. This also implies\nlower bounds on MAPs, a notion newly defined by Gur and Rothblum.\n  The new techniques rely on analyzing a proposed partial tester. We show that\nthe queries performed by a tester must, with high probability, query indexes\nwhere a uniformly random member of the sub-property has low entropy. We then\nshow how one can aggregate the \"entropy loss\" to deduce that a random choice in\nthe sub-property must have low entropy, and therefore the sub-property must be\nsmall.\n  We develop two techniques for aggregating the entropy loss. A simpler\ntechnique that applies to non-adaptive testers is based on partitioning the\ninput bits into high query probability parts and parts where there is an\nentropy loss when conditioned on the high probability parts. Against adaptive\ntesters we develop a technique based on constructing a decision tree. The\nroot-to-leaf paths in this tree rearrange the input into parts where each\nexhibits entropy loss when conditioned on the path prefix. This decision tree\nis constructed by combining carefully selected decision trees from those used\nby the adaptive testing algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Jun 2013 09:52:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-07"}

The dust\ncontent of local star-forming galaxies is set by the competition between the\nphysical processes of dust production and dust loss in our model. The dust loss\nrate is proportional to the dust opacity and star formation rate. Observations\nof the relation between stellar mass and star formation rate at several epochs\nimply that the majority of local star-forming galaxies are best characterized\nas having continuous star formation histories. Dust loss is a consequence of\nsustained interaction of dust with the radiation field generated by continuous\nstar formation.

By comparing our model results with the observed relation between\nstellar mass, dust extinction and star formation rate in local star-forming\ngalaxies we are able to constrain the timescale and magnitude of dust loss. The\ntimescale of dust loss is long and therefore dust is effluxed in a \"Slow Flow\".\nDust loss is modest in low mass galaxies but massive galaxies may lose up to\n70~80% of their dust over their lifetime.

This is due to many factors which\nchange the CME kinematics, like interaction of two or more CMEs or the\ninteraction of CMEs with the pervading solar wind. In order to understand the\npropagation of CMEs, we have used the 3D triangulation method on SECCHI\ncoronagraph (COR2) images, and geometric triangulation on the J-maps\nconstructed from Heliospheric Imagers HI1 and HI2 images for eight\nEarth-directed CMEs observed during 2008-2010.

The two most important\nsources of X-ray photons in the Universe are active galactic nuclei (AGN) and\nX-ray binaries (XRBs). In this Letter we use results from detailed, large scale\npopulation synthesis simulations to study the energy feedback of XRBs, from the\nfirst galaxies (z~ 20) until today. We estimate that X-ray emission from XRBs\ndominates over AGN at z>6-8. The shape of the spectral energy distribution of\nthe emission from XRBs shows little change with redshift, in contrast to its\nnormalization which evolves by ~4 orders of magnitude, primarily due to the\nevolution of the cosmic star-formation rate. However, the metallicity and the\nmean stellar age of a given XRB population affect significantly its X-ray\noutput. Specifically, the X-ray luminosity from high-mass XRBs per unit of\nstar-formation rate varies an order of magnitude going from solar metallicity\nto less than 10% solar, and the X-ray luminosity from low-mass XRBs per unit of\nstellar mass peaks at an age of ~300 Myr and then decreases gradually at later\ntimes, showing little variation for mean stellar ages > 3 Gyr. Finally, we\nprovide analytical and tabulated prescriptions for the energy output of XRBs,\nthat can be directly incorporated in cosmological simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Jun 2013 13:30:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 Sep 2013 10:07:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

Spectro-microscopy techniques, finite element method simulations\nand ab initio calculations are used to investigate the strain state of\nlaterally confined Ge-rich SiGe nano-stripes. Strain information is obtained by\ntip enhanced Raman spectroscopy with an unprecedented lateral resolution of ~\n30 nm. The nano-stripes exhibit a large tensile hydrostatic strain component,\nwhich is maximum at the center of the top free surface, and becomes very small\nat the edges. The maximum lattice deformation is larger than the typical values\nof thermally relaxed Ge/Si(001) layers. This strain enhancement originates from\na frustrated relaxation in the out-of-plane direction, resulting from the\ncombination of the lateral confinement induced by the substrate side walls and\nthe plastic relaxation of the misfit strain in the (001) plane at the SiGe/Si\ninterface.

The\napplication of Penrouse approach in spinor representation of space-time\ncombined with the proposed approach further leads us to chirality of\ninteractions and absence of right neutrino and left spinors in singleton state.\nWe also show the obtained model is consistent with general theory of relativity\nand SU(3) for distances larger than Planck length.

In this paper, we have shown how to\napply fuzzy logic in text mining in order to perform document clustering. We\ntook an example of document clustering where the documents had to be clustered\ninto two categories. The method involved cleaning up the text and stemming of\nwords. Then, we chose m number of features which differ significantly in their\nword frequencies (WF), normalized by document length, between documents\nbelonging to these two clusters. The documents to be clustered were represented\nas a collection of m normalized WF values. Fuzzy c-means (FCM) algorithm was\nused to cluster these documents into two clusters. After the FCM execution\nfinished, the documents in the two clusters were analysed for the values of\ntheir respective m features. It was known that documents belonging to a\ndocument type, say X, tend to have higher WF values for some particular\nfeatures. If the documents belonging to a cluster had higher WF values for\nthose same features, then that cluster was said to represent X. By fuzzy logic,\nwe not only get the cluster name, but also the degree to which a document\nbelongs to a cluster.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Jun 2013 07:35:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-20"}
