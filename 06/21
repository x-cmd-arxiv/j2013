The eventual fate of the\nself-gravitating gas clumps born in the disc is currently not understood,\nalthough the range of uncertainty is well known. If clumps migrate inward\nrapidly, they are tidally disrupted, which may leave behind giant or\nterrestrial like planets. On the other hand, if clumps migrate less rapidly,\nthey tend to accrete gas, becoming proto brown dwarfs or low mass companions to\nthe parent star. Here we argue that radiative feedback of contracting clumps\n(protoplanets) on their discs is an important effect that has been overlooked\nin previous calculations. We show analytically that temperature in clump's\nvicinity may be high enough to support a quasi-static atmosphere if the clump\nmass is below a critical value, $M_{\\rm cr} \\sim 6$ Jupiter masses ($M_J$).\nThis may arrest further gas accretion onto the clump and thus promote formation\nof planets rather than low mass companions. We use numerical simulations to\nevaluate these analytical conclusions by studying migration and accretion of\ngas clumps as a function of their initial mass, $M_i$. Simulations neglecting\nthe radiative preheating effect show that gas clumps with mass less than $\\sim\n2 M_J$ migrate inward rapidly; more massive clumps result in low mass\ncompanions. In contrast, simulations that include radiative preheating from the\nclump show that clumps as massive as $8 M_J$ migrate inward rapidly and end up\ntidally disrupted in the inner disc. We conclude that, with other parameters\nbeing equal, previous simulations neglecting radiative feedback from\nself-gravitating clumps over-estimated the population of brown dwarfs and low\nmass stellar companions and under-estimated the population of planets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Jun 2013 16:03:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

The\nformer can be explained by invoking some energetic process -- most likely AGN\nor star formation feedback -- which expels to infinity a significant fraction\nof the gas initially present in the proto-galaxy, while the latter problem is\nusually explained by star formation feedback inside the dwarf or tidal and ram\npressure stripping of the gas from the satellite galaxy by its parent.

The\nrate at which the follower agents converge to their desired states, as well as\nthe errors in the follower agent states prior to convergence, are determined by\nthe choice of leader agents. In this paper, we study leader selection in order\nto minimize convergence errors experienced by the follower agents, which we\ndefine as a norm of the distance between the follower agents' intermediate\nstates and the convex hull of the leader agent states. By introducing a novel\nconnection to random walks on the network graph, we show that the convergence\nerror has an inherent supermodular structure as a function of the leader set.\nSupermodularity enables development of efficient discrete optimization\nalgorithms that directly approximate the optimal leader set, provide provable\nperformance guarantees, and do not rely on continuous relaxations.

The low redshift of the lens\n(z_lens=0.035) results in arcs being formed at a small fraction of the\neffective radius, (R_Ein ~ R_Eff/4). At such small radii, stars dominate the\nlensing mass, so that lensing provides a direct probe of the stellar\nmass-to-light ratio, with only small corrections needed for dark matter. The\nredshift of the galaxy lensed by ESO325-G004 was unknown until now, so the\nlensing mass was not securely determined. Using X-SHOOTER, we measure a secure\nsource redshift of z_src=2.141. Combined with the lensing configuration, this\nyields a total mass inside the Einstein radius of (1.50+/-0.06) 10^11 M_sun. We\nestimate the range of possible contribution of dark matter to the lensing mass,\nusing statistics from cosmological N-body simulations. Subtracting this\ncomponent yields a stellar M/L ratio for the lens of 3.14^+0.24_-0.42 (M/L)_sun\n(in F814W band). Using VIMOS, we have also obtained very high-S/N spectroscopy\nfor the lens galaxy. The VIMOS data confirm that ESO325-G004 has a very old\nstellar population. For a Kroupa IMF, the stellar population fit yields a\npredicted stellar M/L ratio of 3.01+/-0.25 (M/L)_sun. Hence the mass\nattributable to stars with this IMF is consistent with the lensing estimate. By\ncontrast, a Salpeter or heavier IMF is disfavoured at the 99.8% confidence\nlevel. A \"heavyweight\" IMF, with a mass twice as large as the Kroupa case, is\nfirmly excluded. Such an IMF has been proposed for more distant elliptical\nlenses, and also to explain strong dwarf-star spectral features, in particular\nthe NaI 8200-Ang doublet. A FORS2 far-red spectrum shows that this feature is\nas strong in ESO325-G004 as it is in other high-sigma ellipticals, suggesting\ntension between dwarf-star indicators and lensing-mass constraints for this\ngalaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Jun 2013 20:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

They are typically formed when the\nnormal component of motional (convective) electric field points toward the\nembedded current sheet on at least one of its sides. The core region of an HFA\ncontains hot and highly deflected ion flows and rather low and turbulent\nmagnetic field. In this paper, we report first observations of HFA-like events\nat Mercury identified over a course of two planetary years. Using data from the\norbital phase of the MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and\nRanging (MESSENGER) mission, we identify a representative ensemble of active\ncurrent sheets magnetically connected to Mercury's bow shock. We show that some\nof these events exhibit unambiguous magnetic and particle signatures of HFAs\nsimilar to those observed earlier at other planets, and present their key\nphysical characteristics. Our analysis suggests that Mercury's bow shock does\nnot only mediate the flow of supersonic solar wind plasma but also provides\nconditions for local particle acceleration and heating as predicted by previous\nnumerical simulations. Together with earlier observations of HFA activity at\nEarth, Venus and Saturn, our results confirm that hot flow anomalies are a\ncommon property of planetary bow shocks, and show that the characteristic size\nof these events is of the order of one planetary radius.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Jun 2013 20:57:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

A call for endpoints $\\{u,v\\}$ is routed directly onto the link\nbetween the two nodes if there is spare capacity; otherwise $d$ two-link paths\nbetween $u$ and $v$ are considered, and the call is routed along a path with\nlowest maximum load, if possible. The duration of each call is an exponential\nrandom variable with unit mean. In the case $d=1$, it was suggested by Gibbens,\nHunt and Kelly in 1990 that the equilibrium of this process is related to the\nfixed points of a certain equation.

The Signal-passing Tile\nAssembly Model (STAM) is an extension of the 2HAM in which the tiles are\ndynamically changing components which are able to alter their binding domains\nas they bind together. For our first result, we demonstrate useful techniques\nand transformations for converting an arbitrarily complex STAM$^+$ tile set\ninto an STAM$^+$ tile set where every tile has a constant, low amount of\ncomplexity, in terms of the number and types of ``signals'' they can send, with\na trade off in scale factor.\n  Using these simplifications, we prove that for each temperature $\\tau>1$\nthere exists a 3D tile set in the 2HAM which is intrinsically universal for the\nclass of all 2D STAM$^+$ systems at temperature $\\tau$ (where the STAM$^+$ does\nnot make use of the STAM's power of glue deactivation and assembly breaking, as\nthe tile components of the 2HAM are static and unable to change or break\nbonds). This means that there is a single tile set $U$ in the 3D 2HAM which\ncan, for an arbitrarily complex STAM$^+$ system $S$, be configured with a\nsingle input configuration which causes $U$ to exactly simulate $S$ at a scale\nfactor dependent upon $S$. Furthermore, this simulation uses only two planes of\nthe third dimension. This implies that there exists a 3D tile set at\ntemperature $2$ in the 2HAM which is intrinsically universal for the class of\nall 2D STAM$^+$ systems at temperature $1$.

Through a control-theoretic lens, we\nobserve that the problem is a minimalist example of what is called the \"triple\nrole\" of control actions. We show that a dirty-paper-coding strategy achieves\nthe optimal rate for perfect recovery of the modified host and the message for\nany message rate. For imperfect recovery of the modified host, by deriving\nbounds on the minimum mean-square error (MMSE) in recovering the modified host\nsignal, we show that DPC-based strategies are guaranteed to attain within a\nuniform constant factor of 16 of the optimal weighted sum of power required in\nhost signal modification and the MMSE in the modified host signal\nreconstruction for all weights and all message rates.

One challenge in using radio transmittable apertures is keeping\nthe detectors cool. This is because transparency to thermal radiation above the\nradio frequency range increases the thermal load. A technology that maintains\ncold conditions while allowing larger apertures has been long-awaited. We\npropose radio-transparent multi-layer insulation (RT-MLI), composed from a set\nof stacked insulating layers. The insulator is transparent to radio\nfrequencies, but not transparent to infrared radiation. The basic idea for\ncooling is similar to conventional multi-layer insulation. It leads to a\nreduction in thermal radiation while maintaining a uniform surface temperature.\nThe advantage of this technique over other filter types is that no thermal\nlinks are required. As insulator material, we used foamed polystyrene; its low\nindex of refraction makes an anti-reflection coating unnecessary. We measured\nthe basic performance of RT-MLI to confirm that thermal loads are lowered with\nmore layers. We also confirmed that our RT-MLI has high transmittance to\nradiowaves, but blocks infrared radiation. For example, RT-MLI with 12 layers\nhas a transmittance greater than 95% (lower than 1%) below 200 GHz (above 4\nTHz). We demonstrated its effects in a system with absorptive-type filters,\nwhere aperture diameters were 200 mm. Low temperatures were successfully\nmaintained for the filters.

Models of composite\nsearch can generate predictions about how optimal foragers should behave in\neach search mode, and how they should determine when to switch between search\nmodes. Most of these models assume that foragers use resource encounters to\ndecide when to switch between search modes. Empirical observations indicate\nthat a variety of organisms use non-directional sensory cues to identify areas\nthat warrant intensive search. These cues are not precise enough to allow a\nforager to directly orient itself to a resource, but can be used as a criterion\nto determine the appropriate search mode. As a potential example, a forager\nmight use olfactory information, which could help it determine if an area is\nworth searching carefully. We developed a model of composite search based on\nnon-directional sensory cues. With simulations, we compared the search\nefficiencies of composite foragers that use resource encounters as their\nmode-switching criterion with those that use non-directional sensory cues. We\nidentified optimal search patterns and mode-switching criteria on a variety of\nresource distributions, characterized by different levels of resource\naggregation and density. On all resource distributions, foraging strategies\nbased on the non-directional sensory criterion were more efficient than those\nbased on the resource encounter criterion. Strategies based on the\nnon-directional sensory criterion were also more robust to changes in resource\ndistribution. Our results suggest that current assumptions about the role of\nresource encounters in models of optimal composite search should be\nre-examined. The search strategies predicted by our model can help bridge the\ngap between random search theory and traditional patch-use foraging theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Jun 2013 05:21:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 Feb 2015 21:16:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-26"}

Monte Carlo (MC) simulations\nwith BEAMnrc and DOSXYZnrc codes have been performed to evaluate the\nfeasibility of this approach. The dose distributions in water for open 6MV\nbeams were simulated using Varian 21EX linac head model, which will be called\nflattening filter (FF) model. Flattening filter has then been removed from FF\nmodel, and MC simulations were performed using (1) 6 MeV electrons incident on\nthe target, (2) 6 MeV electron beam with electron angular distributions\noptimized to provide as flat dose profiles as possible.

Calculated profiles demonstrated improved\nflatness of the FFF beams. In fact, up to field sizes within the circle of 35\ncm diameter the flatness of F4 beam at dmax was better or comparable to that of\nFF beam. At 20 cm off-axis the dose increased from 52% for FFF to 92% for F4\nbeam. Also, profiles of F4 beams did not change considerably with depth, and\nfor large fields out-of-field dose was reduced by about a factor of two\ncompared to FF beam. PDDs from F4 beams were similar to those of FFF beam. The\nDR for the largest modeled (44 cm diameter) F4 beam was higher than the DR from\nFF beam by a factor of 1.25. It was shown that the DR can be increased while\nmaintaining beam flatness, but at the cost of reduced field size.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Jun 2013 05:39:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

The\nposterior probability derived from such a likelihood deviates considerably from\nthe exact posterior on the largest scales probed by any survey, where the\ncentral limit theorem does not apply. We show that various forms of Gaussian\nlikelihoods can have a significant impact on the estimation of the primordial\nnon-Gaussianity parameter f_NL from the galaxy angular power spectrum. The\nGaussian plus log-normal likelihood, which has been applied successfully in\nanalyses of the cosmic microwave background, outperforms the Gaussian\nlikelihoods. Nevertheless, even if the exact likelihood of the power spectrum\nis used, the estimated parameters may be still biased. As such, the likelihoods\nand estimators need to be thoroughly examined for potential systematic errors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Jun 2013 07:18:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Sep 2013 02:00:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

Occurance of defect tunneling\ndespite their coupling to phonons is viewed as a hallmark of weak defect-phonon\ncoupling. This is since strong coupling to phonons results in significant\nphonon dressing and suppresses tunneling in two-level tunneling defects\neffectively. Here we determine the dynamics of a crystalline tunnelling defect\nstrongly coupled to phonons incorporating the full 3D geometry in our\ndescription. We find that inversion symmetric tunnelling is not dressed by\nphonons whereas other tunnelling pathways are dressed by phonons and, thus, are\nsuppressed by strong defect-phonon coupling. We provide the linear acoustic and\ndielectric response functions for a crystalline tunnelling defect for strong\ndefect-phonon coupling. This allows direct experimental determination of the\ndefect-phonon coupling. The singling out of inversion-symmetric tunneling\nstates in single tunneling defects is complementary to their dominance of the\nlow energy excitations in strongly disordered solids as a result of\ninter-defect interactions for large defect concentrations. This suggests that\ninversion symmetric two-level systems play a unique role in the low energy\nproperties of disordered solids.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Jun 2013 08:22:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 12 Feb 2017 16:51:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 6 Jul 2017 21:00:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-10"}

Signals with long-range\ntemporal correlations are typically defined as having a power law decay in\ntheir autocorrelation function. The output of DFA is an exponent, which is the\nslope obtained by linear regression of a log-log fluctuation plot against\nwindow size. However, if this fluctuation plot is not linear, then the\nunderlying signal is not self-similar, and the exponent has no meaning. There\nis currently no method for assessing the linearity of a DFA fluctuation plot.\nHere we present such a technique, called ML-DFA. We scale the DFA fluctuation\nplot to construct a likelihood function for a set of alternative models\nincluding polynomial, root, exponential, logarithmic and spline functions. We\nuse this likelihood function to determine the maximum likelihood and thus to\ncalculate values of the Akaike and Bayesian information criteria, which\nidentify the best fit model when the number of parameters involved is taken\ninto account and over-fitting is penalised. This ensures that, of the models\nthat fit well, the least complicated is selected as the best fit. We apply\nML-DFA to synthetic data from FARIMA processes and sine curves with DFA\nfluctuation plots whose form has been analytically determined, and to\nexperimentally collected neurophysiological data. ML-DFA assesses whether the\nhypothesis of a linear fluctuation plot should be rejected, and thus whether\nthe exponent can be considered meaningful.

The signature of the signal is a monoenergetic peak at 2039 keV, the\nQ-value of the decay, Q_bb. To avoid bias in the signal search, the present\nanalysis does not consider all those events, that fall in a 40 keV wide region\ncentered around Q_bb. The main parameters needed for the neutrinoless double\nbeta decay analysis are described. A background model was developed to describe\nthe observed energy spectrum. The model contains several contributions, that\nare expected on the basis of material screening or that are established by the\nobservation of characteristic structures in the energy spectrum. The model\npredicts a flat energy spectrum for the blinding window around Q_bb with a\nbackground index ranging from 17.6 to 23.8*10^{-3} counts/(keV kg yr). A part\nof the data not considered before has been used to test if the predictions of\nthe background model are consistent. The observed number of events in this\nenergy region is consistent with the background model. The background at Q-bb\nis dominated by close sources, mainly due to 42K, 214Bi, 228Th, 60Co and alpha\nemitting isotopes from the 226Ra decay chain. The individual fractions depend\non the assumed locations of the contaminants. It is shown, that after removal\nof the known gamma peaks, the energy spectrum can be fitted in an energy range\nof 200 kev around Q_bb with a constant background. This gives a background\nindex consistent with the full model and uncertainties of the same size.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Jun 2013 09:38:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Apr 2014 15:36:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-11"}

In the light of the users' demand and our\nactual conditions, the self-seeding scheme is adopted for this proposal.\nFirstly, we attempt fixing the electron energy and only changing the undulator\ngap to varying the radiation wavelength, but the analysis implies that it is\ndifficult because of the great difference of the power gain length and FEL\nefficiency at different wavelength. Therefore, dividing the wavelength range\ninto three subareas is considered.

As descendants of the exclusively carnivorous\nwolves, they are subjected to the evolutionary load of a physiological demand\nfor proteins. To meet their protein needs they resort to a thumb rule, if it\nsmells like meat, eat it. Pups face high competition from group and non group\nmembers and are in a phase of rapid growth with high protein demands.

However, if the\nmother supplements their diet with protein rich regurgitates and milk, then the\npups can benefit by being generalists. Using a choice test in the field we show\nthat while adults have a clear preference for meat, pups have no such\npreference, and they even eat degraded protein eagerly. Thus the thumb rule\nused by adult dogs for efficient scavenging is not innate, and needs to be\nlearned.

However, existing methods for ARG inference are computationally\nintensive, highly approximate, or limited to small numbers of sequences, and,\nas a consequence, explicit ARG inference is rarely used in applied population\ngenomics. Here, we introduce a new algorithm for ARG inference that is\nefficient enough to apply to dozens of complete mammalian genomes. The key idea\nof our approach is to sample an ARG of n chromosomes conditional on an ARG of\nn-1 chromosomes, an operation we call \"threading.\" Using techniques based on\nhidden Markov models, we can perform this threading operation exactly, up to\nthe assumptions of the sequentially Markov coalescent and a discretization of\ntime. An extension allows for threading of subtrees instead of individual\nsequences. Repeated application of these threading operations results in highly\nefficient Markov chain Monte Carlo samplers for ARGs. We have implemented these\nmethods in a computer program called ARGweaver. Experiments with simulated data\nindicate that ARGweaver converges rapidly to the true posterior distribution\nand is effective in recovering various features of the ARG for dozens of\nsequences generated under realistic parameters for human populations. In\napplications of ARGweaver to 54 human genome sequences from Complete Genomics,\nwe find clear signatures of natural selection, including regions of unusually\nancient ancestry associated with balancing selection and reductions in allele\nage in sites under directional selection.

Type IIP supernova 2008in is another\nwell-observed event for which a detailed hydrodynamic modeling can be used to\nderive the supernova parameters. Hydrodynamic modeling was employed to describe\nthe bolometric light curve and the expansion velocities at the photosphere\nlevel. A time-dependent model for hydrogen ionization and excitation was\napplied to model the Halpha and Hbeta line profiles. We found an ejecta mass of\n13.6 Msun, an explosion energy of 5.05x10^50 erg, a presupernova radius of 570\nRsun, and a radioactive Ni-56 mass of 0.015 Msun. The estimated progenitor mass\nis 15.5 Msun. We uncovered a problem of the Halpha and Hbeta description at the\nearly phase, which cannot be resolved within a spherically symmetric model. The\npresupernova of SN 2008in was a normal red supergiant with the minimum mass of\nthe progenitor among eight type IIP supernovae explored by means of the\nhydrodynamic modeling. The problem of the absence of type IIP supernovae with\nthe progenitor masses <15 Msun in this sample remains open.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Jun 2013 13:09:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

There\nis now a growing number of experimental indications that the pseudo-gap phase\nactually corresponds to a symmetry breaking state. In his theory for cuprates,\nC. M. Varma proposes that the pseudo-gap is a new state of matter associated\nwith the spontaneous appearance of circulating current loops within $\\rm CuO_2$\nunit cell. This intra-unit-cell order breaks time reversal symmetry, but\npreserves lattice translation invariance. Polarized elastic neutron scattering\nmeasurements provide evidence for an intra-unit-cell magnetic order inside the\npseudo-gap state. This order could be produced by the orbital-like magnetic\nmoments induced by the circulating current loops.

Each new data release has refined further our\nknowledge of quantities -- such as the matter density parameter \\Omega_M --\nthat are imprinted on the dark matter halo mass function (HMF), a powerful\nprobe of dark matter and dark energy models. In this letter we trace how\nchanges in the cosmological parameters over the last decade have influenced\nuncertainty in our knowledge of the HMF. We show that this uncertainty has\nreduced significantly since the 3rd WMAP data release, but the rate of this\nreduction is slowing. This is limited by uncertainty in the normalisation\n\\sigma_8, whose influence is most pronounced at the high mass end of the mass\nfunction. Interestingly, we find that the accuracy with which we can constrain\nthe HMF in terms of the cosmological parameters has now reached the point at\nwhich it is comparable to the scatter in HMF fitting functions. This suggests\nthat the power of the HMF as a precision probe of dark matter and dark energy\nhinges on more accurate determination of the theoretical HMF. Finally, we\nassess prospects of using the HMF to differentiate between Cold and Warm Dark\nMatter models based on ongoing improvements in measurements of \\Omega_M, and we\ncomment briefly on optimal survey strategies for constraining dark matter and\ndark energy models using the HMF.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Jun 2013 13:49:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

Our position is\nthat accessibility and ease of use must be treated as security properties. Even\nif a cryptographic system is technically highly qualified, securing user\nprivacy is not achieved without addressing the problem of accessibility. Our\ngoal is to investigate the feasibility of implementing cryptographic systems in\nhighly accessible mediums, and to address the technical and social challenges\nof making encrypted instant messaging accessible and portable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Jun 2013 14:42:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-24"}

Many important graph-theoretic\nstructures can be represented as list M-partitions, such as graph colourings,\nsplit graphs and homogeneous sets and pairs, which arise in the proofs of the\nweak and strong perfect graph conjectures. There has been quite a bit of work\non determining for which matrices M computations involving list M-partitions\nare tractable.

Similar to our own Uranus and Neptune,\ninefficient accretion of nebular gas is expected produce hot Neptunes whose\nmasses are dominated by elements heavier than hydrogen and helium. At high\natmospheric metallicities of 10-10,000x solar, hot Neptunes will exhibit an\ninteresting continuum of atmospheric compositions, ranging from more\nNeptune-like, H2-dominated atmospheres to more Venus-like, CO2-dominated\natmospheres. We explore the predicted equilibrium and disequilibrium chemistry\nof generic hot Neptunes and find that the atmospheric composition varies\nstrongly as a function of temperature and bulk atmospheric properties such as\nmetallicity and the C/O ratio. Relatively exotic H2O, CO, CO2, and even\nO2-dominated atmospheres are possible for hot Neptunes. We apply our models to\nthe case of GJ 436b, where we find that a CO-rich, CH4-poor atmosphere can be a\nnatural consequence of a very high atmospheric metallicity. From comparisons of\nour results with Spitzer eclipse data for GJ 436b, we conclude that although\nthe spectral fit from the high-metallicity forward models is not quite as good\nas the fit obtained from pure retrieval methods, the atmospheric composition\npredicted by these forward models is more physically and chemically plausible.\nHigh-metallicity atmospheres (orders of magnitude in excess of solar) should\ntherefore be considered as a possibility for GJ 436b and other hot Neptunes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Jun 2013 15:48:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

Permanent \"Stay alive\" signals from their neighbours\nseem to prevent them from dying. In a previous paper (Wang et al. 2013) we gave\nevidence for a density effect for ants. In this paper we examine whether there\nis a similar effect in human demography. We find that although there is no\nobservable relationship between population density and overall death rates,\nthere is a clear relationship between density and the death rates of young\nage-groups. Basically their death rates decrease with increasing density.\nHowever, this relationship breaks down around 300 inhabitants per square\nkilometre. Above this threshold the death rates remains fairly constant. The\nsame density effect is observed in Canada, France, Japan and the United States.\nWe also observe a striking parallel between the density effect and the\nso-called marital status effect in the sense that they both lead to higher\nsuicide rates and are both enhanced for younger age-groups. However, it should\nbe noted that the strength of the density effect is only a fraction of the\nstrength of the marital status effect. In spite of the fact that this parallel\ndoes not give us an explanation by itself, it invites us to focus on\nexplanations that apply to both effects. In this light the \"Stay alive\"\nparadigm set forth by Prof. Martin Raff appears as a natural interpretation. It\ncan be seen as an extension of the \"social ties\" framework proposed at the end\nof the 19th century by the sociologist Emile Durkheim in his study about\nsuicide.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Jun 2013 15:48:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-24"}

Here\nwe study the interaction of a single localized electron with a Bose-Einstein\ncondensate (BEC) and show that it can excite phonons and eventually set the\nwhole condensate into a collective oscillation.

The extended\npermutohedron R(G) on a graph G, and the extended permutohedron Reg(S) on a\njoin-semilattice S, are both defined as lattices of regular closed sets of\nsuitable closure spaces. While the lattice of regular closed sets is, in the\nsemilattice context, always the Dedekind Mac-Neille completion of the poset of\nclopen sets, this does not always hold in the graph context, although it always\ndoes so for finite block graphs and for cycles. Furthermore, both R(G) and\nReg(S) are bounded homomorphic images of free lattices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Jun 2013 06:15:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-08"}

The typical spectrum of the detected\nchemical elements and their isotopes in the AU1500 iodine air filter, which was\nexposed to the bremsstrahlung gamma quantum irradiation, produced by the\naccelerating electrons in the tantalum target, are obtained. The spatial\ndistributions of the detected chemical element 127I and some other chemical\nelements and their isotopes in the layer of absorber, which was made of the\ncylindrical coal granules of the type of SKT3, in the AU1500 iodine air filter\nare also researched. The possible influences by the standing acoustic wave of\nair pressure in the iodine air filter on the spatial distribution of the\nchemical elements and their isotopes in the iodine air filter are discussed.\nThe comprehensive analysis of obtained research results on the distribution of\nthe adsorbed chemical elements and their isotopes in the absorber of iodine air\nfilter is performed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Jun 2013 11:49:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-12"}
