These\nmodels, however, are not effectively capable of representing problems involving\nindividual localisation, memory and emerging properties, which are common\ncharacteristics of cells and molecules of the immune system. Agent-based\nmodelling and simulation is an alternative paradigm to ODE models that\novercomes these limitations. In this paper we investigate the potential\ncontribution of agent-based modelling and simulation when compared to ODE\nmodelling and simulation. We seek answers to the following questions: Is it\npossible to obtain an equivalent agent-based model from the ODE formulation? Do\nthe outcomes differ? Are there any benefits of using one method compared to the\nother? To answer these questions, we have considered three case studies using\nestablished mathematical models of immune interactions with early-stage cancer.\nThese case studies were re-conceptualised under an agent-based perspective and\nthe simulation results were then compared with those from the ODE models. Our\nresults show that it is possible to obtain equivalent agent-based models (i.e.\nimplementing the same mechanisms); the simulation output of both types of\nmodels however might differ depending on the attributes of the system to be\nmodelled. In some cases, additional insight from using agent-based modelling\nwas obtained. Overall, we can confirm that agent-based modelling is a useful\naddition to the tool set of immunologists, as it has extra features that allow\nfor simulations with characteristics that are closer to the biological\nphenomena.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 May 2013 16:09:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-03"}

The scope and objective of this paper is to analyze, evaluate and\ninvestigate the insider threat in cloud security in sensitive infrastructures\nas well as to propose two proactive socio-technical solutions for securing\ncommercial and governmental cloud infrastructures. Firstly, it proposes\nactionable framework, techniques and practices in order to ensure that such\ndisruptions through human threats are infrequent, of minimal duration,\nmanageable, and cause the least damage possible. Secondly, it aims for extreme\nsecurity measures to analyze and evaluate human threats related assessment\nmethods for employee screening in certain high-risk situations using cognitive\nanalysis technology, in particular functional magnetic Resonance Imaging\n(fMRI). The significance of this research is also to counter human rights and\nethical dilemmas by presenting a set of ethical and professional guidelines.\nThe main objective of this work is to analyze related risks, identify\ncountermeasures and present recommendations to develop a security awareness\nculture that will allow cloud providers to utilize effectively the benefits of\nthis advanced techniques without sacrificing system security.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 May 2013 16:59:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-19"}

It is known that for a bipartite system of\nparticles $1,2$ with a Hilbert space $\\mathbb{C}^{d_1}\\otimes\\mathbb{C}^{d_2}$,\na UE exists when $\\min{(d_1,d_2)}\\geq 3$ and $(d_1,d_2)\\neq (3,3)$. It is also\nknown that whenever a UE exists, almost all unitaries are UEs; however to\nverify whether a given unitary is a UE is very difficult since solving a\nquadratic system of equations is NP-hard in general. This work examines the\nexistence and construction of UEs of bipartite bosonic/fermionic systems whose\nwave functions sit in the symmetric/antisymmetric subspace of\n$\\mathbb{C}^{d}\\otimes\\mathbb{C}^{d}$. The development of a theory of UEs for\nthese types of systems needs considerably different approaches from that used\nfor UEs of distinguishable systems. This is because the general entanglement of\nidentical particle systems cannot be discussed in the usual way due to the\neffect of (anti)-symmetrization which introduces \"pseudo entanglement\" that is\ninaccessible in practice. We show that, unlike the distinguishable particle\ncase, UEs exist for bosonic/fermionic systems with Hilbert spaces which are\nsymmetric (resp. antisymmetric) subspaces of\n$\\mathbb{C}^{d}\\otimes\\mathbb{C}^{d}$ if and only if $d\\geq 3$ (resp. $d\\geq\n8$). To prove this we employ algebraic geometry to reason about the different\nalgebraic structures of the bosonic/fermionic systems. Additionally, due to the\nrelatively simple coherent state form of unentangled bosonic states, we are\nable to give the explicit constructions of two bosonic UEs. Our investigation\nprovides insight into the entanglement properties of systems of\nindisitinguishable particles, and in particular underscores the difference\nbetween the entanglement structures of bosonic, fermionic and distinguishable\nparticle systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 May 2013 17:03:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-03"}

Magnetization and\npolarization-resolved reflectivity measurements have been performed down to 2K\nand up to 7T for x = 0.2%. Optical transitions originating from all three free\nexcitons A, B and C, specific to the wurtzite structure, have been observed and\ntheir evolution with the magnetic field determined.

A series of model calculations shows that the\nquantitative inaccuracy of MCD originates from a substantial influence of the\nmagnetization-dependent exchange interactions not only on the spin splittings\nof excitons but also upon their linewidth and oscillator strength. At the same\ntime, a method is proposed that allows to evaluate the field and temperature\ndependencies of the magnetization from MCD spectra.

This\nconsists of two gas giant planets (c and d) with msin i = 0.65 MJup and 0.53\nMJup orbiting with periods 975 and 2468 days, respectively. The two planets\nappear to be in a 5:2 mean motion resonance, as this is required for the system\nto be dynamically stable. A third planet with mass m_b sin i = 0.023 MJup\norbits close to the star with orbital period 9.37 days. Each planet orbit is\nsignificantly eccentric, with current values estimated to be e_b = 0.39, e_c =\n0.27 and e_d = 0.47. In this paper we assess different scenarios that may\nexplain the origin of these eccentric orbits, with particular focus on the\ninnermost body, noting that the large eccentricity of planet b cannot be\nexplained through secular interaction with the outer pair. We consider a\nscenario in which the system previously contained an additional giant planet\nthat was ejected during a period of dynamical instability among the planets.\nN-body simulations are presented that demonstrate that during scattering and\nejection among the outer planets a close encounter between a giant and the\ninner body can raise e_b to its observed value. We consider the possibility\nthat an undetected planet in the system increases the secular forcing of planet\nb by the exterior giant planets, but we find that the resulting eccentricity is\nnot large enough to agree with the observed one. We also consider a scenario in\nwhich the spin-down of the central star causes the system to pass through\nsecular resonance. Spin-down rates below the critical value lead to longterm\ncapture of planet b in secular resonance, driving the eccentricity toward\nunity. If additional short-period low mass planets are present in the system,\nhowever, we find that mutual scattering can release planet b from the secular\nresonance, leading to a system with orbital parameters similar to those\nobserved today.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 May 2013 19:06:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

This limit\ndepends only on the WDM halo mass function and, unlike previous constraints on\nm_x, is independent of any astrophysical modeling. The forthcoming HST Frontier\nFields can significantly tighten these constraints.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 May 2013 20:00:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 Jul 2013 12:40:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-15"}

We use a combination of explicit Godunov methods to advance\nthe gas and radiation variables including the non-stiff source terms, and a\nlocal implicit method to integrate the stiff source terms. We adopt the M1\nclosure relation and include all leading source terms. We employ the reduced\nspeed of light approximation (RSLA) with subcycling of the radiation variables\nin order to reduce computational costs. Our code is dimensionally unsplit in\none, two, and three space dimensions and is parallelized using MPI. The\nstreaming and diffusion limits are well-described by the M1 closure model, and\nour implementation shows excellent behavior for a problem with a concentrated\nradiation source containing both regimes simultaneously. Our operator-split\nmethod is ideally suited for problems with a slowly varying radiation field and\ndynamical gas flows, in which the effect of the RSLA is minimal. We present an\nanalysis of the dispersion relation of RHD linear waves highlighting the\nconditions of applicability for the RSLA. To demonstrate the accuracy of our\nmethod, we utilize a suite of radiation and RHD tests covering a broad range of\nregimes, including RHD waves, shocks, and equilibria, which show second-order\nconvergence in most cases. As an application, we investigate radiation-driven\nejection of a dusty, optically thick shell in the interstellar medium (ISM).\nFinally, we compare the timing of our method with other well-known iterative\nschemes for the RHD equations. Our code implementation, Hyperion, is suitable\nfor a wide variety of astrophysical applications and will be made freely\navailable on the Web.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 May 2013 20:00:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-06"}

Consequently, Spitzer 3.6 and 4.5 um period-magnitude\nand period-color diagrams were re-examined via robust routines, thus providing\nthe reader an alternative interpretation to consider. The relations (nearly\nmean-magnitude) appear non-linear over an extensive baseline (0.45< logPo\n<2.0), particularly the period-color trend, which to first-order follows\nconstant (3.6-4.5) color for shorter-period Cepheids and may transition into a\nbluer convex trough at longer-periods. The period-magnitude functions can be\ndescribed by polynomials (e.g., [3.6 um]=Ko-(3.071+-0.059)\nlogPo-(0.120+-0.032)logPo^2), and Cepheid distances computed using 3.6 and 4.5\num relations agree and the latter provides a first-order consistency check (CO\nsampled at 4.5 um does not seriously compromise those distances). The\nperiod-magnitude relations appear relatively insensitive to metallicity\nvariations ([Fe/H]~0 to -0.75), a conclusion inferred partly from comparing\ngalaxy distances established from those relations and NED-D (n>700), yet a\nsolid conclusion awaits comprehensive mid-infrared observations for metal-poor\nCepheids in IC 1613 ([Fe/H] -1).

Based on the\ncomplete sample of bright long GRBs observed by Swift (BAT6), we propose a new\nscenario for which precursors are explained by assuming that the central GRB\nengine is a newly born magnetar. In this model the precursor and the prompt\nemission arise from accretion of matter onto the surface of the magnetar.

These filaments\nconnect the main nodes of this so-called 'Cosmic Web', which are clusters of\ngalaxies. Although its large-scale distribution is clearly characterized by\nnumerical simulations, constraining the dark matter content of the cosmic web\nin reality turns out to be difficult. The natural method of choice is\ngravitational lensing. However, the direct detection and mapping of the elusive\nfilament signal is challenging and in this work we present two\nmethods,specifically tailored to achieve this task. A linear matched filter\naims at the detection of the smooth mass component of filaments and is\noptimized to perform a shear decomposition that follows the anisotropic\ncomponent of the lensing signal. Filaments clearly inherit this property due to\ntheir morphology. At the same time, the contamination arising from the central\nmassive cluster is controlled in a natural way. The filament 1 {\\sigma}\ndetection is of about {\\kappa} ~ 0.01-0.005 according to the filter's template\nwidth and length, enabling the detection of structures out of reach with other\napproaches. The second, complementary method seeks to detect the clumpy\ncomponent of filaments. The detection is determined by the number density of\nsub-clump identifications in an area enclosing the potential filament, as it\nwas found within the observed field with the filter approach. We test both\nmethods against Mock observations based on realistic N-Body simulations of\nfilamentary structure and prove the feasibility of detecting filaments with\nground-based data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 May 2013 20:00:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

The approach involves the transgenic\nexpression of a misfolded mutant of human preproinsulin, hINSC96Y, which is a\ncause of the disease. When expressed in fly imaginal discs, hINSC96Y causes a\nreduction of adult structures, including the eye, wing and notum. Eye imaginal\ndiscs exhibit defects in both the structure and arrangement of ommatidia. In\nthe wing, expression of hINSC96Y leads to ectopic expression of veins and\nmechano-sensory organs, indicating disruption of wild type signaling processes\nregulating cell fates. These readily measurable disease phenotypes are\nsensitive to temperature, gene dose and sex. Mutant (but not wild type)\nproinsulin expression in the eye imaginal disc induces IRE1-mediated Xbp1\nalternative splicing, a signal for endoplasmic reticulum stress response\nactivation, and produces global change in gene expression. Mutant hINS\ntransgene tester strains, when crossed to stocks from the Drosophila Genetic\nReference Panel produces F1 adults with a continuous range of disease\nphenotypes and large broad-sense heritability. Surprisingly, the severity of\nmutant hINS-induced disease in the eye is not correlated with that in the notum\nin these crosses, nor with eye reduction phenotypes caused by the expression of\ntwo dominant eye mutants acting in two different eye development pathways, Drop\n(Dr) or Lobe (L) when crossed into the same genetic backgrounds. The tissue\nspecificity of genetic variability for mutant hINS-induced disease thus has its\nown distinct signature. The genetic dominance of disease-specific phenotypic\nvariability makes this approach amenable to genome-wide association study\n(GWAS) in a simple F1 screen of natural variation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 May 2013 20:55:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-04"}

High-cadence\nphotometric and spectroscopic observations from the GeV to the radio band\nobtained from a variety of ground-based and space facilities (including the\nVLA, Swift, Fermi, HST and XMM) constrain SN2009ip to be a low energy (E~ 10^50\nerg for an ejecta mass ~ 0.5 Msun) and likely asymmetric explosion in a complex\nmedium shaped by multiple eruptions of the restless progenitor star. Most of\nthe energy is radiated as a result of the shock breaking out through a dense\nshell of material located at 5x10^14 cm with M~0.1 Msun, ejected by the\nprecursor outburst ~40 days before the major explosion. We interpret the NIR\nexcess of emission as signature of dust vaporization of material located\nfurther out (R>4x 10^15 cm), the origin of which has to be connected with\ndocumented mass loss episodes in the previous years. Our modeling predicts\nbright neutrino emission associated with the shock break-out if the cosmic ray\nenergy is comparable to the radiated energy. We connect this phenomenology with\nthe explosive ejection of the outer layers of the massive progenitor star, that\nlater interacted with material deposited in the surroundings by previous\neruptions. Future observations will reveal if the luminous blue variable (LBV)\nprogenitor star survived.

The dust clumps are associated with molecular gas and they\nhave the following average properties: size of 1.6 pc, mass of 3.2x10^3 Msun,\nmolecular hydrogen density of 3.7x10^4 cm^{-3}, dust temperature of 32 K, and\nintegrated luminosity of 5.7x10^5 Lsun, consistent with values found toward\nother massive star forming dust clumps. The CS and 13CO spectra show the\npresence of two velocity components: a high-velocity component at ~ -89 km\ns^{-1}, seen toward four of the clumps, and a low-velocity component at ~ -101\nkm s^{-1} seen toward the other two clumps. Radio continuum emission is present\ntoward four of the molecular clumps, with spectral index estimated for two of\nthem of 0.8+-0.2 and 1.2+-0.2. A high-velocity molecular outflow is found at\nthe center of the brightest clump, with a line width of 26 km s^{-1} (FWHM) in\nCS (J=7-6). Observations of SiO (J=7-6 and J=8-7), and SO (J_K=8_8-7_7 and\nJ_K=8_7-7_6) lines provide estimates of the gas rotational temperature toward\nthis outflow >120 K and >75 K, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 May 2013 22:01:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

Using the\nfact that the mutation matrix in the case of a permutation invariant fitness\nlandscape has a special tridiagonal form, a change of the basis is suggested\nsuch that in the new coordinates a number of analytical results can be\nobtained. In particular, using the eigenvectors of the mutation matrix as the\nnew basis, we show that the quasispecies distribution approaches a binomial one\nand give simple estimates for the speed of convergence. Another consequence of\nthe suggested approach is a parametric solution to the system of equations\ndetermining the quasispecies. Using this parametric solution we show that our\napproach leads to exact asymptotic results in some cases, which are not covered\nby the existing methods. In particular, we are able to present not only the\nlimit behavior of the leading eigenvalue (mean population fitness), but also\nthe exact formulas for the limit quasispecies eigenvector for special cases.\nFor instance, this eigenvector has a geometric distribution in the case of the\nclassical single peaked fitness landscape. On the biological side, we propose a\nmathematical definition, based on the closeness of the quasispecies to the\nbinomial distribution, which can be used as an operational definition of the\nnotorious error threshold.

We reach this conclusion by comparing the\nglobal structure of clustering in real networks with that in maximally random\nand in maximally ordered clustered graphs.

We consider certain Lorentzian\nmanifolds with Abelian holonomy, which are locally modelled by the so called\npp-waves, and which, in general, do not satisfy any of the above conditions.\n%the condition that their curvature sends vectors that are orthogonal to the\nvector field to a multiple of the vector field. We show that compact pp-waves\nare universally covered by a vector space, determine the metric on the\nuniversal cover, and prove that they are geodesically complete. Using this, we\nshow that every Ricci-flat compact pp-wave is a plane wave.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Jun 2013 15:16:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Jul 2013 08:02:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 28 May 2015 04:37:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-12"}

While it is difficult to know what\nthe best approach to such a large classification task would be, it is possible\nto single out some promising directions and preliminary problems. This paper\ndiscusses them and hints at a possible path, still loosely defined, to arrive\nat a classification. It mainly relies on recent progress concerning integrable\nsystems with only non-hyperbolic and non-degenerate singularities.\n  This work originated in an attempt to develop a theory aimed at answering\nsome questions in quantum spectroscopy. Even though quantum integrable systems\ndate back to the early days of quantum mechanics, such as the work of Bohr,\nSommerfeld and Einstein, the theory did not blossom at the time. The\ndevelopment of semiclassical analysis with microlocal techniques in the last\nforty years now permits a constant interplay between spectral theory and\nsymplectic geometry. A main goal of this paper is to emphasize the symplectic\nissues that are relevant to quantum mechanical integrable systems, and to\npropose a strategy to solve them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Jun 2013 15:30:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-04"}
