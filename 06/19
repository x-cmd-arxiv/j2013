It specifies a unique way in which the reward from\ncooperation can be \"fairly\" divided among players. While it has a wide range of\nreal world applications, its use is in many cases hampered by the hardness of\nits computation. A number of researchers have tackled this problem by (i)\nfocusing on classes of games where the Shapley value can be computed\nefficiently, or (ii) proposing representation formalisms that facilitate such\nefficient computation, or (iii) approximating the Shapley value in certain\nclasses of games. For the classical \\textit{characteristic function}\nrepresentation, the only attempt to approximate the Shapley value for the\ngeneral class of games is due to Castro \\textit{et al.} \\cite{castro}. While\nthis algorithm provides a bound on the approximation error, this bound is\n\\textit{asymptotic}, meaning that it only holds when the number of samples\nincreases to infinity. On the other hand, when a finite number of samples is\ndrawn, an unquantifiable error is introduced, meaning that the bound no longer\nholds. With this in mind, we provide non-asymptotic bounds on the estimation\nerror for two cases: where (i) the \\textit{variance}, and (ii) the\n\\textit{range}, of the players' marginal contributions is known. Furthermore,\nfor the second case, we show that when the range is significantly large\nrelative to the Shapley value, the bound can be improved (from $O(\\frac{r}{m})$\nto $O(\\sqrt{\\frac{r}{m}})$).

Further [OIII]5007A longslit\nspectra were obtained with the Ultraviolet and Visual Echelle Spectrograph on\nthe Very Large Telescope (VLT-UVES). These data were used to develop a\nspatio-kinematical model for the [OIII]5007A emission from Abell 65. A\n\"best-fit\" model was found by comparing synthetic spectra and images rendered\nfrom the model to the data. The model comprises an outer shell and an inner\nshell, with kinematical ages of 15000 +/- 5000 yr kpc^-1 and 8000 +/- 3000 yr\nkpc^-1, respectively. Both shells have peanut-shaped bipolar structures with\nsymmetry axes at inclinations of 55 +/- 10 deg (to the line-of-sight) for the\nouter shell and 68 +/- 10 deg for the inner shell. The near-alignment between\nthe nebular shells and the binary orbital inclination (of 68 +/- 2 deg) is\nstrongly indicative that the binary is responsible for shaping the nebula.\nAbell 65 is one of a growing number of planetary nebulae (seven to date,\nincluding Abell 65 itself) for which observations and modelling support the\nshaping influence of a central binary.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Jun 2013 17:24:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 Jun 2013 07:41:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 28 Jun 2013 08:30:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-01"}

The mid-IR emission is characterized by a strong elongation toward\nposition angle PA -52 deg, closely aligned with the polar axis (PA -45 deg). We\ndetermine half-light radii along the major and minor axes at 12.5 {\\mu}m of\n(4.23 +/- 0.63) pc x (1.42 +/- 0.21) pc, which corresponds to\nintrinsically-scaled sizes of (69.4 +/- 10.8) rin x (23.3 +/- 3.5) rin for the\ninner dust radius of rin = 0.061 pc as inferred from near-IR reverberation\nmapping. This implies an axis ratio of 3:1, with about 60-90% of the 8-13\n{\\mu}m emission associated with the polar-elongated component. These\nobservations are difficult to reconcile with the standard interpretation that\nmost of the parsec-scale mid-IR emission in AGN originates from the torus and\nchallenges the justification of using simple torus models to model the\nbroad-band IR emission. It is quite likely that the hot-dust emission in NGC\n3783 as recently resolved by near-IR interferometry is misaligned with the\nmid-IR emitting source, which also finds a correspondence in the two distinct\n3-5 {\\mu}m and 20 {\\mu}m bumps seen in the high-angular resolution spectral\nenergy distribution (SED).

There are also\nstrong theoretical arguments that feedback from supermassive black holes plays\nan important role in shaping the high mass end of the galaxy mass function,\nhence to accurately model galaxies we also need to model the black holes. We\npresent a comparison of two black hole growth models implemented within a\nlarge-scale, cosmological SPH simulation including star formation and feedback.\nOne model is a modified Bondi-Hoyle prescription that grows black holes based\non the smooth density of local gas, while the other is the recently proposed\nAccretion Disc Particle (ADP) method. This model swallows baryonic particles\nthat pass within an accretion radius of the black hole and adds them to a\nsubgrid accretion disc. Black holes are then grown by material from this disc.\nWe find that both models can reproduce local scaling relations, although the\nADP model is offset from the observed relations at high black hole masses. The\ntotal black hole mass density agrees between models to within a factor of\nthree, but both struggle to reproduce the black hole mass function.

Then, we simulate the disc's dynamics by using a 1D model developed\nin a companion paper, such that the warp propagates into the disc as a bending\nwave, which is expected to be the case for protostellar discs. The validity of\nsuch an approach has been confirmed by comparing its results with full 3D SPH\nsimulations on extended discs.

A closed-loop\nscenario is assumed, for which a practical capacity-approaching scheme is\ndeveloped. By applying judiciously chosen unitary operations at the transmit\nand receive nodes, the channel matrices are triangularized so that the\nresulting matrices have equal diagonals, up to a possible multiplicative scalar\nfactor. This, along with the utilization of successive interference\ncancellation, reduces the coding and decoding tasks to those of coding and\ndecoding over the single-antenna additive white Gaussian noise channel. Over\nthe resulting effective channel, any off-the-shelf code may be used. For the\ntwo-user case, it was recently shown that such joint unitary triangularization\nis always possible. In this paper, it is shown that for more than two users, it\nis necessary to carry out the unitary linear processing jointly over multiple\nchannel uses, i.e., space-time processing is employed. It is further shown that\nexact triangularization, where all resulting diagonals are equal, is still not\nalways possible, and appropriate conditions for the existence of such are\nestablished for certain cases. When exact triangularization is not possible, an\nasymptotic construction is proposed, that achieves the desired property of\nequal diagonals up to edge effects that can be made arbitrarily small, at the\nprice of processing a sufficiently large number of channel uses together.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Jun 2013 20:54:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Jun 2016 04:38:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

However, little is known about the social\nnetworks within these online games, or how they evolve over time. Understanding\nhuman social dynamics within massive online games can shed new light on social\ninteractions in general and inform the development of more engaging systems.\nHere, we study a novel, large friendship network, inferred from nearly 18\nbillion social interactions over 44 weeks between 17 million individuals in the\npopular online game Halo: Reach. This network is one of the largest, most\ndetailed temporal interaction networks studied to date, and provides a novel\nperspective on the dynamics of online friendship networks, as opposed to mere\ninteraction graphs. Initially, this network exhibits strong structural turnover\nand decays rapidly from a peak size. In the following period, however, both\nnetwork size and turnover stabilize, producing a dynamic structural\nequilibrium. In contrast to other studies, we find that the Halo friendship\nnetwork is non-densifying: both the mean degree and the average pairwise\ndistance are stable, suggesting that densification cannot occur when\nmaintaining friendships is costly. Finally, players with greater long-term\nengagement exhibit stronger local clustering, suggesting a group-level social\nengagement process.

Correlations\nbetween the power of radio halos and the thermal properties of the hosting\nclusters were established in the last decade, including the connection between\nthe presence of a halo and cluster mergers. The X-ray luminosity and redshift\nlimited Extended GMRT Radio Halo Survey provides a rich and unique dataset for\nstatistical studies of the halos. We uniformly analyze the radio and X-ray data\nfor the GMRT cluster sample, and use the new Planck SZ catalog, to revisit the\ncorrelations between the power of halos and the thermal properties of galaxy\nclusters. We find that the radio power of halos at 1.4 GHz scales with the\ncluster X-ray (0.1--2.4 keV) luminosity computed within R_500 as P_1.4\nL_500^2.0. Our bigger and more homogenous sample confirms that the X-ray\nluminous (L_500 > 5x10^44 erg/s) clusters branch into two populations --- radio\nhalos lie on the correlation, while clusters with upper limits to radio-halo\nemission are well below that correlation. This bimodality remains if we excise\ncool cores from the X-ray luminosities. Correlating with Planck data, we find\nthat P_1.4 scales with the cluster integrated SZ signal within R_500 as P_1.4\nY_500^2.1, in line with previous findings. However, contrary to previous\nstudies that were limited by incompleteness and small sample size, we find that\nthe \"SZ-luminous\" Y_500 > 6x10^-5 Mpc^2 clusters show a bimodal behavior\nsimilar to that in the radio-X-ray diagram. Bimodality of both correlations can\nbe traced to clusters dynamics, with radio halos found exclusively in merging\nclusters. These results confirm the key role of mergers for the origin of giant\nradio halos, suggesting that they trigger the relativistic particle\nacceleration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Jun 2013 22:30:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Oct 2013 22:47:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

This type of wave can be used to invert for near seafloor shear wave\nvelocity structure that is important information for multi-component P-S\nseismic imaging. Three different approaches are taken to understand excitation\nof Scholte waves and numerical aspects of modeling Scholte waves, including\nanalytical Cagniard-de Hoop analysis, the boundary integral method and a\nstaggered grid finite difference method. For simple media for which the Green's\nfunction can be easily computed, the boundary element method produces accurate\nresults. The finite difference method shows strong numerical artifacts and\nstagnant artificial waves can be seen in the vicinity of topography at the\nfluid-solid interface even when using fine computational grids. However, the\namplitude of these artificial waves decays away from the seafloor. It is\nsensible to place receivers away from the fluid-solid interface for seismic\nmodeling. To investigate Scholte wave generation, one needs to correctly\nimplement the fluid-solid boundary condition. It is also shown through\nnumerical examples including using a seafloor profile from the recent SEG\nAdvanced Modeling (SEAM) Project that even mild topographic features can\ngenerate Scholte waves and these waves can be used to constrain near seafloor S\nwave velocity by dispersion analysis of interface Scholte waves. The\nimplication to the full waveform inversion is that, although low frequency data\nare crucial for convergence, seafloor topography may have a large effect on low\nfrequency seismic waves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Jun 2013 22:42:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-20"}

However,\nwe find a higher metallicity cut of $Z=0.52Z_{\\odot}$ than was seen in previous\nstudies, which suggested that LGRBs occur preferentially in metal poor\nenvironments, i.e., $Z\\sim0.1-0.3Z_{\\odot}$. We use a simple power-law\napproximation to the high-\\emph{z} ($\\ga 3.8$) SFH, i.e., $R_{\\rm\nSF}\\propto[(1+z)/4.8]^{\\alpha}$, to examine how the high-\\emph{z} SFR may be\nimpacted by a possible abundance evolution in the Swift GRB sample. For an\nexpansion history consistent with $\\Lambda$CDM, we find that the Swift redshift\nand luminosity distributions can be reproduced with reasonable accuracy if\n$\\alpha=-2.41_{-2.09}^{+1.87}$. For the $R_{\\rm h}=ct$ Universe, the GRB rate\nis slightly different from that in $\\Lambda$CDM, but also requires an extra\nevolutionary effect, with a metallicity cut of $Z=0.44Z_{\\odot}$. Assuming that\nthe SFR and GRB rate are related via an evolving metallicity, we find that the\nGRB data constrain the slope of the high-\\emph{z} SFR in $R_{\\rm h}=ct$ to be\n$\\alpha=-3.60_{-2.45}^{+2.45}$. Both cosmologies fit the GRB/SFR data rather\nwell.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Jun 2013 03:14:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Jan 2014 02:26:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

The most successful computational approach, also called\ntemplate-based modeling, identifies templates with solved crystal structures\nfor the query proteins and constructs three dimensional models based on\nsequence/structure alignments. Although substantial effort has been made to\nimprove protein sequence alignment, the accuracy of alignments between\ndistantly related proteins is still unsatisfactory. In this thesis, I will\nintroduce a number of statistical machine learning methods to build accurate\nalignments between a protein sequence and its template structures, especially\nfor proteins having only distantly related templates. For a protein with only\none good template, we develop a regression-tree based Conditional Random Fields\n(CRF) model for pairwise protein sequence/structure alignment. By learning a\nnonlinear threading scoring function, we are able to leverage the correlation\namong different sequence and structural features. We also introduce an\ninformation-theoretic measure to guide the learning algorithm to better exploit\nthe structural features for low-homology proteins with little evolutionary\ninformation in their sequence profile. For a protein with multiple good\ntemplates, we design a probabilistic consistency approach to thread the protein\nto all templates simultaneously. By minimizing the discordance between the\npairwise alignments of the protein and templates, we are able to construct a\nmultiple sequence/structure alignment, which leads to better structure\npredictions than any single-template based prediction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Jun 2013 04:42:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-20"}

Most\nrealistic astrophysical systems, however, are not isolated - instead they are\nunder the influence of an external field such as the tidal field due to a\nneighbour. Here we do a linear perturbation analysis for a system in an\nexternal field, and obtain a generalized dispersion relation that depends on\nthe wavenumber, the sound speed, and also the magnitude of the tidal field. A\ntypical, disruptive tidal field is shown to make the system more stable against\nperturbations, and results in a higher effective Jeans wavelength. The minimum\nmass that can become unstable is then higher (super-Jeans) than the usual Jeans\nmass. Conversely, in a compressive tidal field, perturbations can grow even\nwhen the mass is lower (sub-Jeans). This approach involving the inclusion of\ntidal field opens up a new way of looking at instabilities in gravitating\nsystems. The treatment is general and the simple analytical form of the\nmodified Jeans criterion obtained makes it easily accessible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Jun 2013 05:20:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

Although it is well established that the UV/optical\nextinction law varies significantly among the different lines of sight, it is\nnot clear how the IR extinction varies among various environments. In this\nwork, using the color-excess method and taking red giants as the extinction\ntracer, we determine the interstellar extinction Alambda in the four\nSpitzer/IRAC bands of the Coalsack nebula, a nearby starless dark cloud, based\non the data obtained from the 2MASS and Spitzer/GLIMPSE surveys. We select five\nindividual regions across the nebula that span a wide variety of physical\nconditions, ranging from diffuse, translucent to dense environments, as traced\nby the visual extinction, the Spitzer/MIPS 24micron emission, and CO emission.\nWe find that Alambda/AKs, the mid-IR extinction relative to AKs, decreases from\ndiffuse to dense environments, which may be explained in terms of ineffective\ndust growth in dense regions. The mean extinction (relative to AKs) is\ncalculated for the four IRAC bands as well, which exhibits a flat mid-IR\nextinction law, consistent with previous determinations for other regions. The\nextinction in the IRAC 4.5micron band is anomalously high, much higher than\nthat of the other three IRAC bands. It cannot be explained in terms of CO and\nCO2 ices. The mid-IR extinction in the four IRAC bands have also been derived\nfor four representative regions in the Coalsack Globule 2 which respectively\nexhibit strong ice absorption, moderate or weak ice absorption, and very weak\nor no ice absorption.

Percentiles are based on an ordered set of citation counts in\na reference set, whereby the fraction of papers at or below the citation counts\nof a focal paper is used as an indicator for its relative citation impact in\nthe set. In this study, we pursue two related objectives: (1) although\ndifferent percentile-based approaches have been developed, an approach is\nhitherto missing that satisfies a number of criteria such as scaling of the\npercentile ranks from zero (all other papers perform better) to 100 (all other\npapers perform worse), and solving the problem with tied citation ranks\nunambiguously. We introduce a new citation-rank approach having these\nproperties, namely P100. (2) We compare the reliability of P100 empirically\nwith other percentile-based approaches, such as the approaches developed by the\nSCImago group, the Centre for Science and Technology Studies (CWTS), and\nThomson Reuters (InCites), using all papers published in 1980 in Thomson\nReuters Web of Science (WoS). How accurately can the different approaches\npredict the long-term citation impact in 2010 (in year 31) using citation\nimpact measured in previous time windows (years 1 to 30)? The comparison of the\napproaches shows that the method used by InCites overestimates citation impact\n(because of using the highest percentile rank when papers are assigned to more\nthan a single subject category) whereas the SCImago indicator shows higher\npower in predicting the long-term citation impact on the basis of citation\nrates in early years. Since the results show a disadvantage in this predictive\nability for P100 against the other approaches, there is still room for further\nimprovements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Jun 2013 08:43:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Sep 2013 12:18:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-18"}

We investigate the possibility of detection of neutral\ninterstellar deuterium at 1 AU from the Sun by direct sampling by the\nInterstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX). We simulate the flux of neutral\ninterstellar D at IBEX for the actual measurement conditions. We assess the\nnumber of interstellar D atom counts expected during the first three years of\nIBEX operation. We also simulate observations expected during an epoch of high\nsolar activity. In addition, we calculate the expected counts of D atoms from\nthe thin terrestrial water layer, sputtered from the IBEX-Lo conversion surface\nby neutral interstellar He atoms. Most D counts registered by IBEX-Lo are\nexpected to originate from the water layer, exceeding the interstellar signal\nby 2 orders of magnitude. However, the sputtering should stop once the Earth\nleaves the portion of orbit traversed by interstellar He atoms. We identify\nseasons during the year when mostly the genuine interstellar D atoms are\nexpected in the signal. During the first 3 years of IBEX operations about 2\ndetectable interstellar D atoms are expected. This number is comparable with\nthe expected number of sputtered D atoms registered during the same time\nintervals. The most favorable conditions for the detection occur during low\nsolar activity, in an interval including March and April each year. The\ndetection chances could be improved by extending the instrument duty cycle,\ne.g., by making observations in the special deuterium mode of IBEX-Lo.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Jun 2013 09:59:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

Since the field\nequations cannot be solved for an arbitrary value of the critical exponent $z$,\nwe obtain a conserved quantity along the $r$ coordinate that enables us to\nrelate the parameters of the metric at the horizon and at infinity. Then, we\ncalculate the energy density of the Lifshitz black brane through the use of the\ncounterterm method generalized for the asymptotic Lifshitz spacetimes. Finally,\nwe present a relation between the energy density and the thermodynamical\nquantities, electric potential, charge density, temperature and entropy\ndensity. This relation is the generalization of Smarr formula for anti-de\nSitter black branes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Jun 2013 11:36:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

These unexpected chemical properties are an\nadditional confirmation of the chemical inhomogeneities already found in\nseveral GC, and probably caused by the first generations of stars formed in\nthese systems. The aim of this article is to complement our understanding of\nthe F-behaviour in GC stars and to look for new constraints on the formation\nhistories of their multiple stellar populations. We have collected near-IR\nspectra of 15 RGB stars belonging to GC spanning a wide range of metallicity:\n47 Tuc, M4, NGC6397 and M30. F, Na and Fe abundances have been estimated by\nspectral synthesis. No anticorrelation between F and Na abundances are found\nfor the most metal-rich cluster of the sample (47 Tuc). In this GC, RGB stars\nindeed exhibit rather small differences in [F/Fe] unlike the larger ones found\nfor the [Na/Fe] ratios. This reveals a rather inhomogeneous stellar system and\na complex chemical evolution history for 47 Tuc . In M4, one star of our study\nconfirms the previous Na-F distribution reported by another group in 2005. For\nthe two very metal-poor GC (NGC6397 and M30), only upper limits of F abundances\nhave been derived. We show that F abundances could be estimated in such\nmetal-poor GC with current telescopes and spectrographs only if unexpected\nF-rich giants are found and/or exceptional observational conditions are met.\nThe distribution of the F and Na abundances in GC reveal that their RGB members\nseem to belong to two well-separated regions. All the RGB stars analysed so far\nin the different GC are indeed found to be either F-rich Na-poor or F-poor\nNa-rich. Such well-separated bimodal regimes are consistent with the separate\nformation episodes suspected in most galactic GC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Jun 2013 13:03:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

We show that (i)\nharmonic whistlers are exact non-linear solutions; (ii) co-linear whistlers do\nnot interact (including counter-propagating); (iii) waves with the same value\nof the wave vector, $k_1=k_2$, do not interact; (iv) whistler modes have a\ndispersion that allows a three-wave decay, including into a zero frequency\nmode; (v) the three-wave interaction effectively couples modes with highly\ndifferent wave numbers and propagation angles. In addition, linear interaction\nof a whistler with a single zero-mode can lead to spatially divergent\nstructures via parametric instability. All these properties are drastically\ndifferent from MHD, so that the qualitative properties of the Alfven turbulence\ncannot be transferred to the EMHD turbulence.\n  We derive the Hamiltonian formulation of EMHD, and using Bogolyubov\ntransformation reduce it to the canonical form; we calculate the matrix\nelements for the three-wave interaction of whistlers.

To improve the debugging process efficiency, some effort was already\nmade to automatically assist the detection and location of software faults.\nThis led to the creation of statistical debugging tools such as Tarantula,\nZoltar and GZoltar. These tools use information gathered from code coverage\ndata and the result of test executions to return a list of potential faulty\nlocations. Although helpful, fault localization tools have some scaling\nproblems because of the fine-grained coverage data they need to perform the\nfault localization analysis. Instrumentation overhead, which in some cases can\nbe as high as 50% is the main cause for their inefficiency. This thesis\nproposes a new approach to this problem, avoiding as much as possible the high\nlevel of coverage detail, while still using the proven techniques these fault\nlocalization tools employ. This approach, named DCC, consists of using a\ncoarser initial instrumentation, obtaining only coverage traces for large\ncomponents. Then, the instrumentation detail of certain components is\nprogressively increased, based on the intermediate results provided by the same\ntechniques employed in current fault localization tools. To assess the validity\nof our proposed approach, an empirical evaluation was performed, injecting\nfaults in four real-world software projects. The empirical evaluation\ndemonstrates that the DCC approach reduces the execution overhead that exists\nin spectrum-based fault localization, and even presents a more concise\npotential fault ranking to the user. We have observed execution time reductions\nof 27% on average and diagnostic report size reductions of 63% on average.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Jun 2013 13:40:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-20"}

The protoplanet has at most a few million years to reach\nrunaway gas accretion, as young stars lose their gas disks after 10 million\nyears at the latest. Yet gas accretion also brings small dust grains entrained\nin the gas into the planetary atmosphere. Dust accretion creates an optically\nthick protoplanetary atmosphere that cannot efficiently radiate away the\nkinetic energy deposited by incoming planetesimals. A dust-rich atmosphere\nseverely slows down atmospheric cooling, contraction, and inflow of new gas, in\ncontradiction to the observed timescales of planet formation.

Even after the primordial accretion disk has been\ncleared out, the star's high-energy radiation continues to affect the formation\nand evolution of dust, planetesimals, and large planets. Young stars with\ndebris disks are thus ideal environments for studying the earliest stages of\nnon-accretion-driven coronae. In this paper we simulate the corona of AU Mic, a\nnearby active M dwarf with an edge-on debris disk. We apply a self-consistent\nmodel of coronal loop heating that was derived from numerical simulations of\nsolar field-line tangling and magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. We also\nsynthesize the modeled star's X-ray luminosity and thermal radio/millimeter\ncontinuum emission. A realistic set of parameter choices for AU Mic produces\nsimulated observations that agree with all existing measurements and upper\nlimits. This coronal model thus represents an alternative explanation for a\nrecently discovered ALMA central emission peak that was suggested to be the\nresult of an inner \"asteroid belt\" within 3 AU of the star. However, it is also\npossible that the central 1.3 mm peak is caused by a combination of active\ncoronal emission and a bright inner source of dusty debris. Additional\nobservations of this source's spatial extent and spectral energy distribution\nat millimeter and radio wavelengths will better constrain the relative\ncontributions of the proposed mechanisms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Jun 2013 14:35:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

In the event that the natural sawtooth period is\nlonger than expected, due to enhanced alpha particle stabilisation for\ninstance, this ancillary sawtooth control can be provided from > 10MW of ion\ncyclotron resonance heating (ICRH) power with a resonance just inside the q = 1\nsurface.

One of\nthem, GRB 081007, also shows a spectroscopically confirmed supernova, SN\n2008hw, which resembles SN 1998bw in its absorption features, while the maximum\nluminosity is only about half as large as that of SN 1998bw. Bright optical\nflashes have been detected in both events, which allows us to derive solid\nconstraints on the circumburst-matter density profile. This is particularly\ninteresting in the case of GRB 081007, whose afterglow is found to be\npropagating into a constant-density medium, yielding yet another example of a\nGRB clearly associated with a massive star progenitor which did not sculpt the\nsurroundings with its stellar wind. There is no supernova component detected in\nthe afterglow of GRB 090424, likely due to the brightness of the host galaxy,\ncomparable to the Milky Way. We show that the afterglow data are consistent\nwith the presence of both forward- and reverse-shock emission powered by\nrelativistic outflows expanding into the interstellar medium. The absence of\noptical peaks due to the forward shock strongly suggests that the reverse shock\nregions should be mildly magnetized. The initial Lorentz factor of outflow of\nGRB 081007 is estimated to be \\Gamma ~ 200, while for GRB 090424 a lower limit\nof \\Gamma > 170 is derived.

There is a strong evidence that these states have\nnon-conventional (or exotic) hadronic structures since their respective masses\nand decay channels observed experimentally are inconsistent with expected for a\nconventional charmonium state. The same phenomenon occurs on the bottomonium\nsector, where new states like Yb(10890) and Yb(11020) observed recently could\nindicate the existence of new bottomonium exotic states. In this way, one\nverifies that the Y(4140) state could be described as a D*sD*s (0++) molecular\nstate or even as a mixture of D*sD*s (0++) and D*D* (0++) molecular states. For\nthe Y(3930) and X(4350) states, both cannot be described as a D*D* (0++) and\nD*sD*s0 (1-+), respectively.

The extension to the\nbottomonium sector is done in a straightforward way to demonstrate that the\n\\Upsilon' f0(980) molecular state is a good candidate for describing the\nstructure of the Yb(10890) state.

The methodology is extended to operate in evolving environments,\nwhere it can no longer be assumed that model parameters remain constant over\ntime. Two areas of application for the methodology are presented: regression\nmodeling when there are multiple data owners and regression modeling within the\nMapReduce framework. A website, realtime-semiparametric-regression.net,\nillustrates the use of the proposed method on United States domestic airline\ndata in real-time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Jun 2013 21:56:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-21"}

It is shown that the\nproblem is reduced to resonant interaction of two position-displaced harmonic\noscillators. Explicit expressions for the eigenstates and eigenvalues of\ngeneralized Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian are presented. We exemplify our\nphysical model with analytical and numerical considerations regarding collapse\nand revivals of the initial population of a two-level system and photon\ndistribution function at the direct multiphoton resonant coupling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Jun 2013 10:54:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

Over a\nlong period, detailed theoretical models for the giant dipole resonances were\nproposed and low energy electron accelerators were constructed to perform\nexperiments to test their veracity. More recently, through laser and \"smart\"\nmaterial devices, electrons have been accelerated in condensed matter systems\nup to several tens of MeV. We discuss here the possibility of inducing\nelectro-disintegration of nuclei through such devices. It involves a synthesis\nof electromagnetic and strong forces in condensed matter via giant dipole\nresonances to give an effective \"electro-strong interaction\" - a large coupling\nof electromagnetic and strong interactions in the tens of MeV range.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Jun 2013 15:20:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-24"}
