Both of\nthese frequencies are independent of the accretion model and defined completely\nby the properties of the black hole gravitational field. Interpretation of the\nknown QPO data by dint of a signal modulation from the hot spots in the\naccreting plasma reveals the Kerr metric rotation parameter, $a=0.65\\pm0.05$,\nand mass, $M=(4.2\\pm0.2)10^6M_\\odot$, of the supermassive black hole in the\nGalactic center. At the same time, the observed 11.5 min QPO period is\nidentified with a period of the black hole event horizon rotation, and,\nrespectively, the 19 min period is identified with a latitudinal oscillation\nperiod of hot spots in the accretion flow.

As such it has been\nan excellent system for discovery of neuromechanical principles of movement. In\nnearly all animals studied, the wave of muscle activation progresses faster\nthan the wave of body bending, leading to an advancing phase of activation\nrelative to the curvature towards the tail. This is referred to as\n\"neuromechanical phase lags\" (NPL). Several multi-parameter neuromechanical\nmodels have reproduced this phenomenon, but due to model complexity the origin\nof the NPL has proved difficult to identify. Here we use perhaps the simplest\nmodel of undulatory swimming to accurately predict the NPL during sand-swimming\nby the sandfish lizard, with no fitting parameters. The sinusoidal wave used in\nsandfish locomotion, the friction-dominated and non-inertial granular resistive\nforce environment, and the simplicity of the model allow detailed analysis, and\nreveal the fundamental mechanism responsible for the phenomenon: the\ncombination of synchronized torques from distant points on the body and local\ntraveling torques. This general mechanism should help explain the NPL in\norganisms in other environments; we therefore propose that sand-swimming could\nbe an excellent system to quantitatively generate and test other\nneuromechanical models of movement.

We consider new experimental conditions which allow both\nelements to be present in the decision making process of the traders, thereby\ncreating a dilemma in terms of investment strategy. Our theoretical framework\nallows us to predict the outcome of this type of trading experiments, depending\non such variables as the number of people trading, the liquidity of the market,\nthe amount of information used in technical analysis strategies, as well as the\ndividends attributed to an asset.

In\nthis paper, we investigate the problem of predicting risk-of-readmission as a\nsupervised learning problem, using a multi-layer classification approach.\nEarlier contributions inadequately attempted to assess a risk value for 30 day\nreadmission by building a direct predictive model as opposed to our approach.\nWe first split the problem into various stages, (a) at risk in general (b) risk\nwithin 60 days (c) risk within 30 days, and then build suitable classifiers for\neach stage, thereby increasing the ability to accurately predict the risk using\nmultiple layers of decision. The advantage of our approach is that we can use\ndifferent classification models for the subtasks that are more suited for the\nrespective problems. Moreover, each of the subtasks can be solved using\ndifferent features and training data leading to a highly confident diagnosis or\nrisk compared to a one-shot single layer approach.

We propose an approach which is motivated by canonical\ncorrelation analysis (CCA), a statistical technique which has proven successful\nin a wide variety of pattern recognition problems. Like CCA when applied to the\nmatching of sets, our extended canonical correlation analysis (E-CCA) aims to\nextract the most similar modes of variability within two sets. Our first major\ncontribution is the formulation of a principled framework for robust inference\nof such modes from data in the presence of uncertainty associated with noise\nand sampling randomness. E-CCA retains the efficiency and closed form\ncomputability of CCA, but unlike it, does not possess free parameters which\ncannot be inferred directly from data (inherent data dimensionality, and the\nnumber of canonical correlations used for set similarity computation). Our\nsecond major contribution is to show that in contrast to CCA, E-CCA is readily\nadapted to match sets in a discriminative learning scheme which we call\ndiscriminative extended canonical correlation analysis (DE-CCA). Theoretical\ncontributions of this paper are followed by an empirical evaluation of its\npremises on the task of face recognition from sets of rasterized appearance\nimages. The results demonstrate that our approach, E-CCA, already outperforms\nboth CCA and its quasi-discriminative counterpart constrained CCA (C-CCA), for\nall values of their free parameters.

The models include a new wind braking law based on\nrecent numerical simulations of magnetized stellar winds and specific dynamo\nand mass-loss prescriptions are adopted to tie angular momentum loss to angular\nvelocity. The model additionally assume constant angular velocity during the\ndisk accretion phase and allow for decoupling between the radiative core and\nthe convective envelope as soon as the former develops. We have developed\nrotational evolution models for slow, median and fast rotators with initial\nperiods of 10, 7, and 1.4d, respectively. The models reproduce reasonably well\nthe rotational behaviour of solar-type stars between 1 Myr and 4.5 Gyr,\nincluding PMS to ZAMS spin up, prompt ZAMS spin down, and the early-MS\nconvergence of surface rotation rates. We find the model parameters accounting\nfor the slow and median rotators are very similar to each other, with a disk\nlifetime of 5 Myr and a core-envelope coupling timescale of 28-30 Myr.

Three interspecific pairs of natural populations\nfrom three ecologically different regions, one in central Europe (SW Germany)\nand two in the Balkan Peninsula (Greece and Bulgaria) were sampled. Grouping of\nhighly informative SSR loci was made according to the component of variation\nthey express - interspecific or provenance specific. Species and provenance\ndiscriminant loci were characterized based on FSTs. Locus specific FSTs were\ntested for deviation from the neutral expectation both within and between\nspecies. Data were then treated separately in a Bayesian analysis of genetic\nstructure. By using three species discriminant loci, high membership\nprobability to inferred species groups was achieved. On the other hand,\nanalysis of genetic structure based on five provenance discriminant loci was\ncorrelated with geographic region and revealed shared genetic variation between\nneighbouring Q. petraea and Q. robur. Small sets of highly variable nuclear\nSSRs were sufficient to discriminate, either between species or between\nprovenances. Thus, an effective tool is provided for molecular identification\nof both species and provenances. Furthermore, data suggest that a combination\nof gene flow and natural selection forms these diversity patterns. Species\ndiscriminant loci might represent genome regions affected by directional\nselection, which maintains species identity.

For some specific strength of the magnetic field, vortex\nlattice forms and the correlation function of the bosons exhibits solid like\nbehavior, which is a kind of Bose-Einstein condensation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Jun 2013 09:27:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 28 Sep 2013 09:21:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-18"}

The goal was to obtain accurate\norbital and component properties, in combination with essential information\nderived from spectroscopy. A binary model for KIC 11285625 was obtained, using\na combined analysis of high-quality space-based Kepler light curves and\nground-based high-resolution HERMES echelle spectra. The binary model was used\nto separate the pulsation characteristics from the orbital variability in the\nKepler light curve in an iterative way. We used an automated procedure to\nperform this task, based on the JKTEBOP binary modelling code, and adapted\ncodes for frequency analysis and prewhitening of periodic signals. Using a\ndisentangling technique applied to the composite HERMES spectra, we obtained a\nhigher signal-to-noise mean component spectrum for both the primary and the\nsecondary. A model grid search method for fitting synthetic spectra was used\nfor fundamental parameter determination for both components. Accurate orbital\nand component properties of KIC 11285625 were derived, and we have obtained the\npulsation spectrum of the gamma Dor pulsator in the system. Detailed analysis\nof the pulsation spectrum revealed amplitude modulation on a time scale of a\nhundred days, and strong indications of frequency splittings at both the\norbital frequency, and the rotational frequency derived from spectroscopy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Jun 2013 09:31:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

These quantities are linked to the nature\nof charge screening in the model, and we illustrate that the screening becomes\nincreasingly universal as the strength of the local interactions is increased.\nWe then use the model to derive analytical expressions for various physical\nquantities, including the Madelung energy and the disorder broadening in the\ncore level binding energies.

The reconstruction of gene trees based on sequence alone almost always\ninvolves choosing between statistically equivalent or weakly distinguishable\nrelationships that could be much better resolved based on a putative species\ntree. To exploit this potential for accurate reconstruction of gene trees the\nspace of reconciled gene trees must be explored according to a joint model of\nsequence evolution and gene tree-species tree reconciliation.\n  Here we present amalgamated likelihood estimation (ALE), a probabilistic\napproach to exhaustively explore all reconciled gene trees that can be\namalgamated as a combination of clades observed in a sample of trees. We\nimplement ALE in the context of a reconciliation model, which allows for the\nduplication, transfer and loss of genes. We use ALE to efficiently approximate\nthe sum of the joint likelihood over amalgamations and to find the reconciled\ngene tree that maximizes the joint likelihood.\n  We demonstrate using simulations that gene trees reconstructed using the\njoint likelihood are substantially more accurate than those reconstructed using\nsequence alone. Using realistic topologies, branch lengths and alignment sizes,\nwe demonstrate that ALE produces more accurate gene trees even if the model of\nsequence evolution is greatly simplified. Finally, examining 1099 gene families\nfrom 36 cyanobacterial genomes we find that joint likelihood-based inference\nresults in a striking reduction in apparent phylogenetic discord, with 24%, 59%\nand 46% percent reductions in the mean numbers of duplications, transfers and\nlosses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Jun 2013 11:33:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-11"}

DR is a major ingredient of the solar dynamo but\nobservations of stellar DR are rather sparse. In view of the Kepler space\ntelescope we are interested in the detection of DR using photometric\ninformation of the star, and to develop a fast method to determine stellar DR\nfrom photometric data. We ran a large Monte-Carlo simulation of differentially\nrotating spotted stars with very different properties to investigate the\ndetectability of DR. For different noise levels the resulting light curves are\nprewhitened using Lomb-Scargle periodograms to derive parameters for a global\nsine fit to detect periodicities. We show under what conditions DR can\nsuccessfully be detected from photometric data, and in which cases the light\ncurve provides insufficient or even misleading information on the stellar\nrotation law. In our simulations, the most significant period P1_{out} could be\ndetected in 96.2% of all light curves. Detection of a second period close to\nP1_{out} is the signature of DR in our model. For the noise-free case, in 64.2%\nof all stars such a period was found. Calculating the measured latitudinal\nshear of two distinct spots \\alpha_{out}, and comparing it to the known\noriginal spot rotation rates shows that the real value is on average 3.2%\nlower. Comparing the total equator-to-pole shear $\\alpha$ to $\\alpha_{out}$ we\nfind that $\\alpha$ is underestimated by 8.8%, esp. the detection of DR for\nstars with $\\alpha$ < 6% is challenging. Finally, we apply our method to four\ndifferentially rotating Kepler stars and find close agreement with results from\ndetailed modeling. Our method is capable of measuring stellar rotation periods\nand detecting DR with relatively high accuracy and is suitable for large data\nsets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Jun 2013 12:12:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

Given a set of\nnoisy observations $Z_i=X_i+\\epsilon_i$, $i=1,...,n$, the goal is to design\nclusters associated with the law of $X_i$'s, with unknown density $f$ with\nrespect to the Lebesgue measure. Since we observe a corrupted sample, a direct\napproach as the popular {\\it $k$-means} is not suitable in this case. In this\npaper, we propose a noisy $k$-means minimization, which is based on the\n$k$-means loss function and a deconvolution estimator of the density $f$. In\nparticular, this approach suffers from the dependence on a bandwidth involved\nin the deconvolution kernel. Fast rates of convergence for the excess risk are\nproposed for a particular choice of the bandwidth, which depends on the\nsmoothness of the density $f$.\n  Then, we turn out into the main issue of the paper: the data-driven choice of\nthe bandwidth. We state an adaptive upper bound for a new selection rule,\ncalled ERC (Empirical Risk Comparison). This selection rule is based on the\nLepski's principle, where empirical risks associated with different bandwidths\nare compared. Finally, we illustrate that this adaptive rule can be used in\nmany statistical problems of $M$-estimation where the empirical risk depends on\na nuisance parameter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Jun 2013 13:15:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-11"}

Many current pulsation codes apply a\nsecond order finite-difference scheme, combined with Richardson extrapolation\nto reach fourth order accuracy on eigenfunctions. Although this is a simple and\nrobust approach, a number of drawbacks exist thus making fourth order schemes\ndesirable. A robust and simple finite-difference scheme, which can easily be\nimplemented in either 1D or 2D stellar pulsation codes is therefore required.\n  Aims: One of the difficulties in setting up higher order finite-difference\nschemes for stellar pulsations is the so-called mesh-drift instability. Current\nways of dealing with this defect include introducing artificial viscosity or\napplying a staggered grids approach. However these remedies are not well-suited\nto eigenvalue problems, especially those involving non-dissipative systems,\nbecause they unduly change the spectrum of the operator, introduce\nsupplementary free parameters, or lead to complications when applying boundary\nconditions.\n  Methods: We propose here a new method, inspired from the staggered grids\nstrategy, which removes this instability while bypassing the above\ndifficulties. Furthermore, this approach lends itself to superconvergence, a\nprocess in which the accuracy of the finite differences is boosted by one\norder.\n  Results: This new approach is shown to be accurate, flexible with respect to\nthe underlying grid, and able to remove mesh-drift.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Jun 2013 14:40:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

Then M^n\nmust be an orbit of an irreducible s-representation (i.e. the isotropy\nrepresentation of a semisimple Riemannian symmetric space).\n  If n=2, then the normal holonomy is always transitive, unless M is a\nhomogeneous isoparametric hypersurface of the sphere (and so the conjecture is\ntrue in this case). We prove the conjecture when n=3. In this case M^3 must be\neither isoparametric or a Veronese submanifold. The proof combines geometric\narguments with (delicate) topological arguments that uses information from two\ndifferent fibrations with the same total space (the holonomy tube and the\ncaustic fibrations).\n  We also prove the conjecture for n>= 3 when the normal holonomy acts\nirreducibly and the codimension is the maximal possible n(n+1)/2. This gives a\ncharacterization of Veronese submanifolds in terms of normal holonomy. We also\nextend this last result by replacing the homogeneity assumption by the\nassumption of minimality (in the sphere).\n  Another result of the paper, used for the case n=3, is that the number of\nirreducible factors of the local normal holonomy group, for any Euclidean\nsubmanifold M^n, is less or equal than [n/2] (which is the rank of the\northogonal group SO(n)). This bound is sharp and improves the known bound\nn(n-1)/2.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Jun 2013 15:21:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-11"}
