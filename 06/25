The IMC method is a stochastic computational technique for nonlinear\nradiation transport.

Abdikamalov extended IMC\nand DDMC to multigroup, velocity-dependent transport with the intent of\nmodeling neutrino dynamics in core-collapse supernovae. Densmore has also\nformulated a multifrequency extension to the originally grey DDMC method. We\nrigorously formulate IMC and DDMC over a high-velocity Lagrangian grid for\npossible application to photon transport in the post-explosion phase of Type Ia\nsupernovae. This formulation includes an analysis that yields an additional\nfactor in the standard IMC-to-DDMC spatial interface condition. To our\nknowledge the new boundary condition is distinct from others presented in prior\nDDMC literature. The method is suitable for a variety of opacity distributions\nand may be applied to semi-relativistic radiation transport in simple fluids\nand geometries. Additionally, we test the code, called SuperNu, using an\nanalytic solution having static material, as well as with a manufactured\nsolution for moving material with structured opacities. Finally, we demonstrate\nwith a simple source and 10 group logarithmic wavelength grid that IMC-DDMC\nperforms better than pure IMC in terms of accuracy and speed when there are\nlarge disparities between the magnitudes of opacities in adjacent groups.

Obtaining a good model of the operating envelope using\nphysics becomes intractable owing to engine transient effects. In this paper, a\nmachine learning based approach is employed to identify the stable operating\nboundary of HCCI combustion directly from experimental data.

A re-sampling\n(under-sampling, over-sampling) based approach is used to develop models using\nexisting algorithms while a cost-sensitive approach is used to modify the\nlearning algorithm without modifying the data set.

Yet, approximate model counting has been\nstudied essentially only theoretically. The only reported implementation of\napproximate model counting, due to Karp and Luby, worked only for DNF formulas.\nA few existing tools for CNF formulas are bounding model counters; they can\nhandle realistic problem sizes, but fall short of providing counts within given\ntolerance and confidence, and, thus, are not approximate model counters.\n  We present here a novel algorithm, as well as a reference implementation,\nthat is the first scalable approximate model counter for CNF formulas.

Often, in practical\napplications, the contribution of the problem variables to the objective\nfunction is such that many pairwise correlations between variables are\nnegligible, implying, in the smooth case, a sparse structure in the Hessian\nmatrix. To be able to exploit Hessian sparsity, existing optimization\napproaches require the knowledge of the sparsity structure. The goal of this\npaper is to develop and analyze a method where the sparse models are\nconstructed automatically. The sparse recovery theory developed recently in the\nfield of compressed sensing characterizes conditions under which a sparse\nvector can be accurately recovered from few random measurements. Such a\nrecovery is achieved by minimizing the l1-norm of a vector subject to the\nmeasurements constraints. We suggest an approach for building sparse quadratic\npolynomial interpolation models by minimizing the l1-norm of the entries of the\nmodel Hessian subject to the interpolation conditions. We show that this\nprocedure recovers accurate models when the function Hessian is sparse, using\nrelatively few randomly selected sample points. Motivated by this result, we\ndeveloped a practical interpolation-based trust-region method using\ndeterministic sample sets and minimum l1-norm quadratic models.

The wealth of multi-wavelength data available and the new\nresults provided by Fermi-LAT give us an opportunity to find new PWNe and to\nexplore the radiative processes taking place in known ones. The TeV gamma-ray\nunidentifiedsources (UNIDs) are the best candidates for finding new PWNe. Using\n45 months of Fermi-LAT data for energies above 10 GeV, an analysis was\nperformed near the position of 58TeV PWNe and UNIDs within 5deg of the Galactic\nPlane to establish new constraints on PWNe properties and find new clues on the\nnature of UNIDs.

The spectral energy\ndistributions (SED) andupper limits, in the multi-wavelength context, also\nprovide new information on the source nature and can help distinguish between\nemission scenarios, i.e. between classification as a pulsar candidate or as a\nPWN candidate. Six new GeV PWNe candidates are described in detail and compared\nwith existing models.

It is an observable quantity that is determined by important\nphysical mechanisms during formation, namely the accretion shock structure, and\neven more fundamentally, the basic formation mechanism (core accretion or\ngravitational instability). We study the impact of the core mass on the\npost-formation entropy and luminosity of young giant planets forming via core\naccretion with a supercritical shock (cold accretion). For this, we conduct\nself-consistently coupled formation and evolution calculations of giant planets\nwith masses between 1 and 12 Jovian masses and core masses between 20 and 120\nEarth masses. We find that the post-formation luminosity of massive giant\nplanets is very sensitive to the core mass. An increase of the core mass by a\nfactor 6 results in an increase of the post-formation luminosity of a 10 Jovian\nmass planet by a factor 120. Due to this dependency, there is no single well\ndefined post-formation luminosity for core accretion, but a wide range. For\nmassive cores (~100 Earth masses), the post-formation luminosities of core\naccretion planets become so high that they approach those in the hot start\nscenario that is often associated with gravitational instability. For the\nmechanism to work, it is necessary that the solids are accreted before or\nduring gas runaway accretion, and that they sink deep into the planet. We make\nno claims whether or not such massive cores can actually form in giant planets.\nBut if yes, it becomes difficult to rule out core accretion as formation\nmechanism based solely on luminosity for directly imaged planets that are more\nluminous than predicted for low core masses. Instead of invoking gravitational\ninstability as the consequently necessary formation mode, the high luminosity\ncould also be caused simply by a more massive core.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Jun 2013 20:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

Thermal conduction has been suggested as a mechanism that\ncan help bring simulations of cluster cores into better alignment with\nobservations by stabilizing the feedback processes that regulate gas cooling,\nbut this idea has not yet been well tested with cosmological numerical\nsimulations. Here we present cosmological simulations of ten galaxy clusters\nperformed with five different levels of isotropic Spitzer conduction, which\nalters both the cores and outskirts of clusters, but not dramatically. In the\ncores, conduction flattens central temperature gradients, making them nearly\nisothermal and slightly lowering the central density but failing to prevent a\ncooling catastrophe there. Conduction has little effect on temperature\ngradients outside of cluster cores because outward conductive heat flow tends\nto inflate the outer parts of the intracluster medium (ICM) instead of raising\nits temperature. In general, conduction tends reduce temperature inhomogeneity\nin the ICM, but our simulations indicate that those homogenizing effects would\nbe extremely difficult to observe in ~5 keV clusters. Outside the virial\nradius, our conduction implementation lowers the gas densities and temperatures\nbecause it reduces the Mach numbers of accretion shocks. We conclude that\ndespite the numerous small ways in which conduction alters the structure of\ngalaxy clusters, none of these effects are significant enough to make the\nefficiency of conduction easily measurable unless its effects are more\npronounced in clusters hotter than those we have simulated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Jun 2013 20:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

We discuss the\nexperimental prospects for the observation of these decays and for the direct\nmeasurement of the Hccbar coupling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Jun 2013 20:22:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Oct 2013 15:32:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

This system exhibits a superorbital modulation with a period\nvarying between ~40 d and ~65 d. The instantaneous frequency and the\ncorresponding phase of the superorbital modulation can be obtained by a\nrecently developed time-frequency analysis technique, the Hilbert-Huang\ntransform (HHT). We present a phase-resolved analysis of both the spectra and\nthe orbital profiles with the superorbital phase derived from the HHT. The\nX-ray spectra observed by the Proportional Counter Array onboard the Rossi\nX-ray Timing Explorer are fitted well by a blackbody plus a Comptonized\ncomponent. The plasma optical depth, which is a good indicator of the\ndistribution of material along the line of sight, is significantly\nanti-correlated with the flux detected at 2.5-25 keV. However, the relationship\nbetween the plasma optical depth and the equivalent width of the iron line is\nnot monotonic: there is no significant correlation for fluxes higher than ~35\nmCrab but clear positive correlation when the intensity is lower than ~20\nmCrab. This indicates that the iron line production is dominated by different\nregions of this binary system in different superorbital phases. To study the\ndependence of the orbital profile on the superorbital phase, we obtained the\neclipse profiles by folding the All Sky Monitor light curve with the orbital\nperiod for different superorbital states. A dip feature, similar to the\npre-eclipse dip in Her X-1, lying at orbital phase ~0.6-0.85, was discovered\nduring the superorbital transition state. This indicates that the accretion\ndisk has a bulge that absorbs considerable X-ray emission in the stream-disk\ninteraction region. The dip width is anti-correlated with the flux, and this\nrelation can be interpreted by the precessing tilted accretion disk scenario.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Jun 2013 01:02:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

To confirm the exponential trapping-time distribution in a\nsolidlike state, we investigate water clusters, $($H${}_2$O$)_6$ and\n$($H${}_2$O$)_{12}$, by molecular dynamics simulations.

Having uniformly close\ntangents is not sufficient. What is needed in addition is either that the\ntangents have dimension with uniform constants independent from the point and\nthe tangent, or that the tangents are unique. We will apply our results to\nequiregular subRiemannian manifolds and show that locally their Nagata\ndimension equals the topological dimension.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Jun 2013 07:01:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 Jan 2014 19:57:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-09"}

The energy range of\nphotons which undergo strong mixing with ALPs depends on the ALP mass, on its\ncoupling with photons as well as on the external magnetic field and particle\ndensity configurations. Recent observations of blazars by the Fermi Gamma-Ray\nSpace Telescope in the 0.1-300 GeV energy range show a break in their spectra\nin the 1-10 GeV range. We have modeled this spectral feature for the\nflat-spectrum radio quasar 3C454.3 during its November 2010 outburst, assuming\nthat a significant fraction of the gamma rays convert to ALPs in the large\nscale jet of this blazar. Using theoretically motivated models for the magnetic\nfield and particle density configurations in the kiloparsec scale jet, outside\nthe broad-line region, we find an ALP mass $m_a\\sim (1-3)\\cdot 10^{-7}$ eV and\ncoupling $g_{a\\gamma} \\sim (1-3)\\cdot 10^{-10}$ GeV$^{-1}$ after performing an\nillustrative statistical analysis of spectral data in four different epochs of\nemission. The precise values of $m_a$ and $g_{a\\gamma}$ depend weakly on the\nassumed particle density configuration and are consistent with the current\nexperimental bounds on these quantities.

In the frame of the cold disc\naccretion scenario, we study for the first time how angular momentum builds up\ninside the star during its formation and what are the consequences for its\nevolution on the main sequence (MS). Computation begins from a hydrostatic core\non the Hayashi line of 0.7 Msol at solar metallicity (Z=0.014) rotating as a\nsolid body. Accretion rates depending on the luminosity of the accreting object\nare considered varying between 1.5e-5 and 1.7e-3 Msol/yr. The accreted matter\nis assumed to have an angular velocity equal to that of the outer layer of the\naccreting star. Models are computed for a mass-range on the zero-age main\nsequence (ZAMS) between 2 and 22 Msol. We study how the internal and surface\nvelocities vary as a function of time during the accretion phase and the\nevolution towards the ZAMS. Stellar models, whose evolution has been followed\nalong the pre-MS phase, are found to exhibit a shallow gradient of angular\nvelocity on the ZAMS. Interestingly, for masses on the ZAMS larger than 8 Msol,\nthere exists a maximum surface velocity that can be reached through the present\nscenario of formation. Typically, for 14 Msol models, only stars with surface\nvelocities on the ZAMS lower than about 45% of the critical velocity can be\nformed. To reach higher velocities would require to start from cores rotating\nabove the critical limit. We find that this upper velocity limit is smaller for\nhigher masses. In contrast, below 8 Msol, there is no restriction and the whole\ndomain of velocities, up to the critical one, can be reached.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Jun 2013 08:12:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

The critical accretion rate for\nsuch a truncation is a function of the viscosity and magnetic field.\nObservations of X-ray photon indices and spectral fits of a number of LLAGNs\npublished in the literature provide an estimate of the critical rate of mass\naccretion and the truncation radius respectively. By comparing the\nobservational results with theoretical predictions, the viscosity and magnetic\nfield parameters in the hot accretion flow region are estimated. Specifically,\nthe mass accretion rates inferred in different sources constrain the viscosity\nparameter, whereas the truncation radii of the disk, as inferred from spectral\nfits, further constrain the magnetic field parameter.

It has recently been\nsuggested that the Hall effect, a non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) effect,\ncould revive these dead zones by enhancing the magnetically active column\ndensity by an order of magnitude or more. We investigate this idea by\nperforming local, three-dimensional, resistive Hall-MHD simulations of the MRI\nin situations where the Hall effect dominates over Ohmic dissipation. As\nexpected from linear stability analysis, we find an exponentially growing\ninstability in regimes otherwise linearly stable in resistive MHD.

We refer to these structures as zonal\nfields and zonal flows, respectively. Their emergence causes a steep reduction\nin turbulent transport by at least two orders of magnitude from extrapolations\nbased upon resistive MHD, a result that calls into question contemporary models\nof layered accretion.

This will be\nrealized by considering cost functionals including $L^1$-norm terms penalizing\na broadly distributed control of the group, while promoting its sparsity. On\nthe other hand, from the analysis point of view, and for the sake of\ngenerality, we consider broader classes of convex control penalizations. In\norder to develop this new concept of limit rigorously, we need to carefully\ncombine the classical concept of mean-field limit, connecting the finite\ndimensional system of ODE describing the dynamics of each individual of the\ngroup to the PDE describing the dynamics of the respective probability\ndistribution, with the well-known concept of $\\Gamma$-convergence to show that\noptimal strategies for the finite dimensional problems converge to optimal\nstrategies of the infinite dimensional problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Jun 2013 10:58:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-20"}

To do this we apply a multi-component, multi-band spectral synthesis\ntechnique to a sample of 250 micron selected galaxies of the Herschel\nMulti-tiered Extragalactic Survey, with IRS spectra available for all galaxies.\nOur results confirm that the inclusion of the IRS spectra plays a crucial role\nin the spectral analysis of galaxies with an AGN component improving the\nselection of the best-fit hot dust model (torus). We find a correlation between\nthe obscured star formation rate (SFR) derived from the IR luminosity of the\nstarburst component, SFR_IR and SFR_PAH, derived from the luminosity of the PAH\nfeatures, L_PAH, with SFR_FIR taking higher values than SFR_PAH. The\ncorrelation is different for AGN- and starburst-dominated objects. The ratio of\nL_PAH to that of the starburst component, L_PAH/L_SB, is almost constant for\nAGN-dominated objects but decreases with increasing L_SB for\nstarburst-dominated objects. SFR_FIR increases with the accretion luminosity,\nL_acc, with the increase less prominent for the very brightest, unobscured\nAGN-dominated sources.

We argue that, in virtue\nof integrability of the dilatation operator, the two polynomials satisfy a\nduality relation -- they are proportional to each other upon an appropriate\nidentification of momenta and coordinates. Combined with the conventional N=4\nsuperconformal symmetry, this leads to the dual superconformal symmetry of the\ndilatation operator. We demonstrate that this symmetry is powerful enough to\nfix the eigenspectrum of the dilatation operator to the lowest order in the\ncoupling.

This approach has several attractive features: (i) the\nhierarchical structure based on an octree is particular well suited for\ngenerating follow up resimulation or zoom initial conditions; (ii) the phases\nare defined for all relevant physical scales in advance so that resimulation\ninitial conditions are, by construction, consistent both with their parent\nsimulation and with each other; (iii) the field can easily be made public by\nreleasing a code to compute it - once public, phase information can be shared\nor published by specifying a spatial location within the realisation.

In general, measurements of the transition form factor F(Q^2) =\nF_{{pi^0}^*gamma^*gamma^*}(m_{pi}^2, -Q^2, 0) are only sensitive to a subset of\nthe model parameters. Thus, having a good description for F(Q^2) is only\nnecessary, not sufficient, to determine a_{mu}(LbyL; pi^0). Simulations have\nshown that measurements at KLOE-2 should be able to determine the (pi^0 ->\ngamma gamma) decay width to 1% statistical precision and the transition form\nfactor for small space-like momenta, 0.01 GeV^2 < Q^2 < 0.1 GeV^2, to 6%\nprecision.

Common disclosure\nrisk measures focus on sample unique cells in these tables and adopt parametric\nlog-linear models as the standard statistical tools for the problem. Such\nmodels often have to deal with large and extremely sparse tables that pose a\nnumber of challenges to risk estimation.

The main finding is that the inclusion of such random effects\nallows us to reduce considerably the number of fixed effects required to\nachieve reliable risk estimates.

To better constrain predictions of\nyields from these phenomena, we have performed a sensitivity study by\npost-processing thermodynamic histories from two different hydrodynamic,\nChandrasekhar-mass explosion models. We have individually varied all input\nreaction and, for the first time, weak interaction rates by a factor of ten and\ncompared the yields in each case to yields using standard rates. Of the 2305\nnuclear reactions in our network, we find that the rates of only 53 reactions\naffect the yield of any species with an abundance of at least 10^-8 M_sun by at\nleast a factor of two, in either model. The rates of the 12C(a,g), 12C+12C,\n20Ne(a,p), 20Ne(a,g) and 30Si(p,g) reactions are among those that modify the\nmost yields when varied by a factor of ten.

Additional tests reveal that reaction rate changes over\ntemperatures T > 1.5 GK have the greatest impact, and that ratios of\nradionuclides that may be used as explosion diagnostics change by a factor of\nless than two from the variation of individual rates by a factor of 10.\nNucleosynthesis in the two adopted models is relatively robust to variations in\nindividual nuclear reaction and weak interaction rates.

The first concept begins with\nrewriting the perturbation equations in a form that is closely related to\nmatrix diagonalization methods. That allows a simple, compact derivation of the\nstandard (Rayleigh-Schr\\\"odinger) equations. But it also leads to a new\niterative solution method that is not based on the usual power series\nexpansion. The iterative method can also be used when the unperturbed system is\ntwo-fold degenerate. The second concept is quite different from the first but\ncompatible with it. It is based on the fact that one can replace the true\nHamiltonian with a synthetic Hamiltonian having the same eigenvalues. This\napproach allows one to cancel part of the perturbation and to reduce the size\nof the off-diagonal matrix elements, giving better convergence of the series.\nThese methods are illustrated by application to three perturbed harmonic\noscillator problems--a 1-D oscillator with a linear perturbation, a 1-D\noscillator with a quartic perturbation, and a perturbed 2-D oscillator, which\ninvolves degenerate states. The iterative method and the synthetic Hamiltonian\nmethod are shown to give significantly better results than the standard method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Jun 2013 16:37:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Oct 2013 01:15:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-25"}

In cases where it has been tested\nexperimentally, this reflected shock approximation (RSA) has been found to be\nfairly accurate at pressures as high as 100 GPa. The success of the RSA is\nusually attributed to the lack of thermal effects, i.e., that the Hugoniot and\nrelease adiabat are nearly identical in the pressure-density (P-rho) plane.\nThis report demonstrates that this explanation is not correct. The success of\nthe RSA does not arise from the absence of thermal effects--it arises because\nof thermal effects. When the Hugoniot and adiabat are identical in the P-rho\nplane, the adiabat lies below the reflected Hugoniot when mapped into the P-UP\nplane. Material strength effects also cause the exact adiabat to lie below the\nRSA. A thermal offset between the Hugoniot and the adiabat compensates for\nthese two effects, so that the RSA turns out to give good results for many\nmaterials, even at high pressures. However, this fortuitous cancellation of\nerrors does not occur in all cases. This report shows that the RSA is not\naccurate for two \"soft\" materials, Teflon and PMMA, and for a high-strength\nmaterial, tungsten.
