(2002) between Epi, the peak energy of\nthe prompt GRB emission, and Eiso, the energy released by the GRB assuming\nisotropic emission. This correlation has been disputed by various authors, and\nour aim is to assess whether it is an intrinsic GRB property or the consequence\nof selection effects. We constructed a sample of Fermi GRBs with homogeneous\nselection criteria, and we studied their distribution in the Epi-Eiso plane.\nOur sample is made of 43 GRBs with a redshift and 243 GRBs without a redshift.\nWe show that GRBs with a redshift follow a broad Epi-Eiso relation, while GRBs\nwithout a redshift show several outliers. We use these samples to discuss the\nimpact of selection effects associated with GRB detection and with redshift\nmeasurement. We find that the Epi-Eiso relation is partly due to intrinsic GRB\nproperties and partly due to selection effects. The lower right boundary of the\nEpi-Eiso relation stems from a true lack of luminous GRBs with low Epi. In\ncontrast, the upper left boundary is attributed to selection effects acting\nagainst the detection GRBs with low Eiso and large Epi that appear to have a\nlower signal-to-noise ratio. In addition, we demonstrate that GRBs with and\nwithout a redshift follow different distributions in the Epi-Eiso plane. GRBs\nwith a redshift are concentrated near the lower right boundary of the Epi-Eiso\nrelation. This suggests that it is easier to measure the redshift of GRBs close\nto the lower Epi-Eiso boundary. In this context, we attribute the controversy\nabout the reality of the Amati relation to the complex nature of this relation\nresulting from the combination of a true physical boundary and biases favoring\nthe detection and the measurement of the redshift of GRBs located close to this\nboundary.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Jun 2013 16:00:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Sep 2013 08:55:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-12"}

In\nsuch a setup, even an omniscient offline scheduling strategy cannot achieve\nstability of the packet queue, nor is it able to use up all the available\nbandwidth. Hence, an important first step is to identify an appropriate metric\nfor measuring the efficiency of scheduling strategies in such a setting. To\nthis end, we propose a relative throughput metric which corresponds to the long\nterm competitive ratio of the algorithm with respect to the optimal. We then\nexplore the impact of the error detection mechanism and feedback delay on our\nmeasure. We compare instantaneous error feedback with deferred error feedback,\nthat requires a faulty packet to be fully received in order to detect the\nerror. We propose algorithms for worst-case adversarial and stochastic packet\narrival models, and formally analyze their performance. The relative throughput\nachieved by these algorithms is shown to be close to optimal by deriving lower\nbounds on the relative throughput of the algorithms and almost matching upper\nbounds for any algorithm in the considered settings.

However, observations\ntaken approximately 1400 and 2400 days into quiescence were consistent with\neach other, suggesting the crust had reached thermal equilibrium with the core.\nHere we present a new Chandra observation of MXB 1659-29 taken 11 years into\nquiescence and 4 years since the last Chandra observation. This new observation\nshows an unexpected factor of ~3 drop in count rate and change in spectral\nshape since the last observation, which cannot be explained simply by continued\ncooling. Two possible scenarios are that either the neutron star temperature\nhas remained unchanged and there has been an increase in the column density,\nor, alternatively the neutron star temperature has dropped precipitously and\nthe spectrum is now dominated by a power-law component. The first scenario may\nbe possible given that MXB 1659-29 is a near edge-on system, and an increase in\ncolumn density could be due to build-up of material in, and a thickening of, a\ntruncated accretion disk during quiescence. But, a large change in disk height\nmay not be plausible if standard accretion disk theory holds during quiescence.\nAlternatively, the disk may be precessing, leading to a higher column density\nduring this latest observation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Jun 2013 16:58:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 Jul 2013 13:33:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

In connection with this, we also comment about astrophysical\njets present in young stellar objects, and we briefly discuss similarities and\ndifferences with extragalactic AGN and gamma-ray bursters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Jun 2013 17:49:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-10"}

Moreover, the\ndark energy poses a serious confrontation between fundamental physics and\ncosmology. This makes a strong case to discover alternative theories which do\nnot require the dark sectors of the standard approach to explain the\nobservations.\n  In the present situation, it would be important to gain insight about the\nrequirements of the `would be' final theory from all possible means. In this\ncontext, the present paper highlights some, hitherto unnoticed, interesting\ncoincidences which may prove useful to develop insight about the `holy grail'\nof gravitation. It appears that the requirement of the speculative dark sectors\nby the energy-stress tensor, is indicative of a possible way out of the present\ncrisis appearing in the standard cosmology, in terms of a theory wherein the\nenergy-stress tensor does not play a direct role in the dynamics. It is shown\nthat various cosmological observations can be explained satisfactorily in the\nframework of one such theory $-$ the Milne model, without requiring the dark\nsectors of the standard approach. Moreover, the model evades the horizon,\nflatness and the cosmological constant problems afflicting the standard\ncosmology.\n  Though Milne's theory is an incomplete, phenomenological theory, and cannot\nbe the final theory of gravitation, nevertheless, it would be worthwhile to\nstudy these coincidences, which may help us develop insight about the would-be\nfinal theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Jun 2013 19:06:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-10"}

The mid-IR spectra show strong polycyclic aromatic\nhydrocarbon (PAH) emission and our spectral decomposition suggests that the AGN\nmakes a minimal contribution (<25%) to the mid-IR luminosity. The 70 micron\nselected ULIRGs which we find to be spectroscopic close pairs, are observed to\nhave high SFE, similar to local ULIRGs and high redshift submillimeter\ngalaxies, consistent with enhanced IR luminosity due to an ongoing major\nmerger. Combined with existing observations of local and high redshift ULIRGs,\nwe further compare the PAH, IR and CO luminosities. We show that the ratio\nLPAH6.2/LIR decreases with increasing IR luminosity for both local and high\nredshift galaxies but the trend for high redshift galaxies is shifted to higher\nIR luminosities; the average LPAH6.2/LIR ratio at a given LIR is ~3 times\nhigher at high redshift. When we normalize by the molecular gas, we find this\ntrend to be uniform for galaxies at all redshifts and that the molecular gas is\ncorrelated with the PAH dust emission.The similar trends seen in the [CII] to\nmolecular gas ratios in other studies suggests that PAH emission, like [CII],\ncontinues to be a good tracer of photodissociation regions even at high\nredshift.

For four candidates, the message is, roughly, that most\nscoring rules (with the exception of Borda) do not guarantee the existence of a\npure Nash equilibrium but that Condorcet-consistent rules, for an odd number of\nvoters, do. For five candidates, most rules we study no longer have this\nguarantee.

Particularly, the\npaper establishes the optimal rate of convergence in two steps for the minimax\nsup-norm risk of convex functions with the H\\\"older order between one and two.\nIn the first step, by applying information theoretical results on probability\nmeasure distance, we establish the minimax lower bound under the supreme norm\nby constructing a novel family of piecewise quadratic convex functions in the\nH\\\"older class. In the second step, we develop a penalized convex spline\nestimator and establish the minimax upper bound under the supreme norm. Due to\nthe convex shape constraint, the optimality conditions of penalized convex\nsplines are characterized by nonsmooth complementarity conditions. By\nexploiting complementarity methods, a critical uniform Lipschitz property of\noptimal spline coefficients in the infinity norm is established. This property,\nalong with asymptotic estimation techniques, leads to uniform bounds for bias\nand stochastic errors on the entire interval of interest. This further yields\nthe optimal rate of convergence by choosing the suitable number of knots and\npenalty value. The present paper provides the first rigorous justification of\nthe optimal minimax risk for convex estimation under the supreme norm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Jun 2013 01:46:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-11"}

Two challenging issues that arise in this context are the\nevaluation of the equivalent kernel and the determination of a local penalty.\nThe roughness penalty is a function of the design points in order to\naccommodate local behavior of the regression function. It is shown that the\nspatially adaptive smoothing spline estimator is approximately a kernel\nestimator. The resulting equivalent kernel is spatially dependent. The\nequivalent kernels for traditional smoothing splines are a special case of this\ngeneral solution. With the aid of the Green's function for a two-point boundary\nvalue problem, the explicit forms of the asymptotic mean and variance are\nobtained for any interior point. Thus, the optimal roughness penalty function\nis obtained by approximately minimizing the asymptotic integrated mean square\nerror.

In one interpretation, the switching originates\nfrom carriers with spin-dependent scattering giving rise to a relativistic\nanti-damping spin-orbit torque (SOT) in structures with broken space-inversion\nsymmetry. The alternative interpretation combines the relativistic spin Hall\neffect (SHE), making the normal-conductor an injector of a spin-current, with\nthe non-relativistic spin-transfer torque (STT) in the ferromagnet. Remarkably,\nthe SHE in these experiments originates from the Berry phase effect in the band\nstructure of a clean crystal and the anti-damping STT is also based on a\ndisorder-independent transfer of spin from carriers to magnetization. Here we\nreport the observation of an anti-damping SOT stemming from an analogous Berry\nphase effect to the SHE. The SOT alone can therefore induce magnetization\ndynamics based on a scattering-independent principle. The ferromagnetic\nsemiconductor (Ga,Mn)As we use has a broken space-inversion symmetry in the\ncrystal. This allows us to consider a bare ferromagnetic element which\neliminates by design any SHE related contribution to the spin torque. We\nprovide an intuitive picture of the Berry phase origin of the anti-damping SOT\nand a microscopic modeling of measured data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Jun 2013 08:19:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-11"}

We use\nequilibrium analysis of chemical kinetics to obtain functional forms that are\nin turn used to infer networks using steady-state data. The approach we propose\nis directly applicable to conventional steady-state gene expression or\nproteomic data and does not require knowledge of either network topology or any\nkinetic parameters. We illustrate the approach in the context of protein\nphosphorylation networks, using data simulated from a recent mechanistic model\nand proteomic data from cancer cell lines. In the former, the true network is\nknown and used for assessment, whereas in the latter, results are compared\nagainst known biochemistry. We find that the proposed methodology is more\neffective at estimating network topology than methods based on linear models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Jun 2013 10:43:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-03"}

Time-reversal symmetry (TRS) protected TIs are\ncharacterized by the Z2 topological invariant and their helical property\nbecomes lost in an applied magnetic field. Currently there exist extensive\nefforts searching for TIs that are protected by symmetries other than TRS. Here\nwe show, a topological phase characterized by a spin Chern topological\ninvariant is realized in an inverted electron-hole bilayer engineered from\nindium arsenide-gallium antimonide (InAs/GaSb) semiconductors which retains\nrobust helical edges under a strong magnetic field. Wide conductance plateaus\nof 2e2/h value are observed; they persist to 12T applied in-plane magnetic\nfield without evidence for transition to a trivial insulator. In a\nperpendicular magnetic field up to 8T, there exists no signature to the bulk\ngap closing. While the Fermi energy remains inside the bulk gap, the\nlongitudinal conductance increases from 2e2/h in strong magnetic fields\nsuggesting a trend towards chiral edge transport. Our findings are first\nevidences for a quantum spin Hall (QSH) insulator protected by a spin Chern\ninvariant. These results demonstrate that InAs/GaSb bilayers are a novel system\nfor engineering the robust helical edge channels much needed for spintronics\nand for creating and manipulating Majorana particles in solid state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Jun 2013 14:43:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-10"}
