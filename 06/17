Given a set of reasonable starting\nconditions and a prescription for angular momentum loss, we address the\nexpected range of rotation periods for cool field stellar populations. We find\nthat cool stars fall into three distinct regimes in rotation. Rapid rotators\nwith surface periods less than 10 days are either young low-mass main sequence\n(MS) stars, or higher mass subgiants which leave the MS with high rotation\nrates. Intermediate rotators (10-40 days) can be either cool MS dwarfs,\nsuitable for gyrochronology, or crossing subgiants at a range of masses.\nGyrochronology relations must therefore be applied cautiously, since there is\nan abundant population of subgiant contaminants. The slowest rotators, at\nperiods greater than 40 days, are lower mass subgiants undergoing envelope\nexpansion. We identify additional diagnostic uses of rotation periods. There\nexists a period-age relation for subgiants distinct from the MS period-age\nrelations. There is also a period-radius relation that can be used as a\nconstraint on the stellar radius, particularly in the interesting case of\nplanet host stars. The high-mass/low-mass break in the rotation distribution on\nthe MS persists onto the subgiant branch, and has potential as a diagnostic of\nstellar mass.

But while we\nknow how to scale systems to increase capacity, reducing latency --- especially\nthe tail of the latency distribution --- can be much more difficult. In this\npaper, we argue that the use of redundancy is an effective way to convert extra\ncapacity into reduced latency. By initiating redundant operations across\ndiverse resources and using the first result which completes, redundancy\nimproves a system's latency even under exceptional conditions. We study the\ntradeoff with added system utilization, characterizing the situations in which\nreplicating all tasks reduces mean latency. We then demonstrate empirically\nthat replicating all operations can result in significant mean and tail latency\nreduction in real-world systems including DNS queries, database servers, and\npacket forwarding within networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Jun 2013 21:19:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-18"}

In this model, one additional such\nwork tape provides additional learning power over the automatic learner model\nand two additional work tapes give full learning power. Furthermore, one can\nalso consider additional queues or additional stacks in place of additional\nwork tapes and for these devices, one queue or two stacks are sufficient for\nfull learning power while one stack is insufficient.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Jun 2013 01:46:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Jun 2013 08:23:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 16 Sep 2013 15:45:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-19"}

Next-generation GW detectors are expected to\ndetect signals from the NS merger within 200 Mpc. Detection of electromagnetic\nwave (EM) counterpart is crucial to understand the nature of GW sources. Among\npossible EM emission from the NS merger, emission powered by radioactive\nr-process nuclei is one of the best targets for follow-up observations.\nHowever, prediction so far does not take into account detailed r-process\nelement abundances in the ejecta. We perform radiative transfer simulations for\nthe NS merger ejecta including all the r-process elements from Ga to U for the\nfirst time. We show that the opacity in the NS merger ejecta is about kappa =\n10 cm^2 g^{-1}, which is higher than that of Fe-rich Type Ia supernova ejecta\nby a factor of ~ 100. As a result, the emission is fainter and longer than\npreviously expected. The spectra are almost featureless due to the high\nexpansion velocity and bound-bound transitions of many different r-process\nelements. We demonstrate that the emission is brighter for a higher mass ratio\nof two NSs and a softer equation of states adopted in the merger simulations.\nBecause of the red color of the emission, follow-up observations in red optical\nand near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths will be the most efficient. At 200 Mpc,\nexpected brightness of the emission is i = 22 - 25 AB mag, z = 21 - 23 AB mag,\nand 21 - 24 AB mag in NIR JHK bands.

In this work, we analyze the light curves of two\nbinary-lens events OGLE-2006-BLG-277 and OGLE-2012-BLG-0031 for which the light\ncurves exhibit strong deviations from standard models. From modeling\nconsidering various second-order effects, we find that the deviations are\nmostly explained by the effect of the lens orbital motion. We also find that\nlens parallax effects can mimic orbital effects to some extent. This implies\nthat modeling light curves of binary-lens events not considering orbital\neffects can result in lens parallaxes that are substantially different from\nactual values and thus wrong determinations of physical lens parameters. This\ndemonstrates the importance of routine consideration of orbital effects in\ninterpreting light curves of binary-lens events.

A natural question that arises\nin this context with respect to any such model is this:\n  Given a function f:{0,1}^n \\to {0,1}, can we compute the optimal complexity\nof computing f in the computational model in question? (according to some\ndesirable measure).\n  A critical issue regarding this question is how exactly is f given, since a\nmore elaborate description of f allows the algorithm to use more computational\nresources. Among the possible representations are black-box access to f (such\nas in computational learning theory), a representation of f in the desired\ncomputational model or a representation of f in some other model. One might\nconjecture that if f is given as its complete truth table (i.e., a list of f's\nvalues on each of its 2^n possible inputs), the most elaborate description\nconceivable, then any computational model can be efficiently computed, since\nthe algorithm computing it can run poly(2^n) time. Several recent studies show\nthat this is far from the truth - some models have efficient and simple\nalgorithms that yield the desired result, others are believed to be hard, and\nfor some models this problem remains open.\n  In this thesis we will discuss the computational complexity of this question\nregarding several common types of computational models.

It is known that when the\nsymmetry algebra is large enough, symmetry may fully prescribe the dynamics.\nHowever, the way this is borne out in two dimensional hydrodynamics, both\nclassical and quantum, is not fully understood. Here we take a step in\nclarifying this issue, by focusing on a particular example, namely that of a\ntwo dimensional phase space liquid which emerges when one considers the\nCalogero model, a many-body one-dimensional system interacting through an\ninverse square law potential. We demonstrate how the symmetry algebra of\nconserved quantities of the one dimensional system is expressed in terms of the\nincompressible Euler hydrodynamics of point vortices in phase space. Due to a\nformal relation between quantum hydrodynamics and classical stochastic\nhydrodynamics, which is inherent in the method of stochastic quantization, the\nideas and methods developed here may also have application in the study of\nstochastic classical hydrodynamics, after suitable modifications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Jun 2013 09:17:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 Jun 2013 10:36:46 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 27 Nov 2013 04:44:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-28"}

Firstly, the attraction measure of spatial interaction in human\nsystems is defined by the product of traffic inflow and outflow.

Secondly, the scaling exponent of the gravity\nmodel based on the inverse distance relationship is revealed to be the ratio of\nthe fractal dimension of networks of cities to that of hierarchies of cities.\nThe value of the scaling exponent is then shown to approach to 2, which\ncorresponds to the value of the power exponent of the law of gravity in\nclassical physics. Thirdly, the inverse power function is demonstrated to be\nmore acceptable than the negative exponential function as an impedance function\nof the gravity model.

Consequently, successful\nblind deconvolution requires the estimation of a spatially-varying or\nnon-uniform blur operator. Using ideas from Bayesian inference and convex\nanalysis, this paper derives a non-uniform blind deblurring algorithm with\nseveral desirable, yet previously-unexplored attributes. The underlying\nobjective function includes a spatially adaptive penalty which couples the\nlatent sharp image, non-uniform blur operator, and noise level together. This\ncoupling allows the penalty to automatically adjust its shape based on the\nestimated degree of local blur and image structure such that regions with large\nblur or few prominent edges are discounted. Remaining regions with modest blur\nand revealing edges therefore dominate the overall estimation process without\nexplicitly incorporating structure-selection heuristics. The algorithm can be\nimplemented using a majorization-minimization strategy that is virtually\nparameter free. Detailed theoretical analysis and empirical validation on real\nimages serve to validate the proposed method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Jun 2013 12:12:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-18"}

In this\npaper, we present extended descriptions of ThemeCrowds and SentireCrowds, two\ntag-based visualization techniques for this data.

In terms of user preference, multilevel tag clouds were\nfound to be more enjoyable to use. Despite both interfaces being usable for all\ntested tasks, we have evidence to support that list interfaces can be more\nefficient for tasks when an appropriate ordering is known beforehand.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Jun 2013 12:54:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-18"}

The transition\nfrom the misfolded states to the native state can far exceed biologically\nrelevant time. Thus, RNA folding in vivo is often aided by protein cofactors,\ncalled RNA chaperones, that can rescue RNAs from a multitude of misfolded\nstructures. We consider two models, based on chemical kinetics and chemical\nmaster equation, for describing assisted folding. In the passive model,\napplicable for class I substrates, transient interactions of misfolded\nstructures with RNA chaperones alone are sufficient to destabilize the\nmisfolded structures, thus entropically lowering the barrier to folding. For\nthis mechanism to be efficient the intermediate ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex\nbetween collapsed RNA and protein cofactor should have optimal stability. We\nalso introduce an active model (suitable for stringent substrates with small\n$\\phi_F$), which accounts for the recent experimental findings on the action of\nCYT-19 on the group I intron ribozyme, showing that RNA chaperones does not\ndiscriminate between the misfolded and the native states. In the active model,\nthe RNA chaperone system utilizes chemical energy of ATP hydrolysis to\nrepeatedly bind and release misfolded and folded RNAs, resulting in substantial\nincrease of yield of the native state. The theory outlined here shows, in\naccord with experiments, that in the steady state the native state does not\nform with unit probability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Jun 2013 13:24:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-24"}

Second,\nthe coloring method is not dependent on any specific method of projection, but\nis rather modular to fit any objective function suitable for the task at hand.\nThe cluster coloring is illustrated on two datasets: the iris data, and welfare\nand poverty indicators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Jun 2013 13:57:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-26"}

In\n\\cite{SchTir02,SchTir03,TalBook} many of the predictions of the statistical\nmechanics were rigorously shown to be correct. In our own work\n\\cite{StojnicGardGen13} we then presented an alternative way that can be used\nto study the spherical perceptrons as well. Among other things we reaffirmed\nmany of the results obtained in \\cite{SchTir02,SchTir03,TalBook} and thereby\nconfirmed many of the predictions established by the statistical mechanics.\nThose mostly relate to spherical perceptrons with positive thresholds (which we\nwill typically refer to as the positive spherical perceptrons). In this paper\nwe go a step further and attack the negative counterpart, i.e. the perceptron\nwith negative thresholds. We present a mechanism that can be used to analyze\nmany features of such a model. As a concrete example, we specialize our results\nfor a particular feature, namely the storage capacity. The results we obtain\nfor the storage capacity seem to indicate that the negative case could be more\ncombinatorial in nature and as such a somewhat harder challenge than the\npositive counterpart.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Jun 2013 10:49:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-19"}

The analytical treatment for a special class of\nperceptrons started in seminal work of Gardner \\cite{Gar88}. Techniques\ninitially employed to characterize perceptrons relied on a statistical\nmechanics approach. Many of such predictions obtained in \\cite{Gar88} (and in a\nfollow-up \\cite{GarDer88}) were later on established rigorously as mathematical\nfacts (see, e.g.\n\\cite{SchTir02,SchTir03,TalBook,StojnicGardGen13,StojnicGardSphNeg13,StojnicGardSphErr13}).\nThese typically related to spherical perceptrons. A lot of work has been done\nrelated to various other types of perceptrons. Among the most challenging ones\nare what we will refer to as the discrete perceptrons. An introductory\nstatistical mechanics treatment of such perceptrons was given in\n\\cite{GutSte90}. Relying on results of \\cite{Gar88}, \\cite{GutSte90}\ncharacterized many of the features of several types of discrete perceptrons. We\nin this paper, consider a similar subclass of discrete perceptrons and provide\na mathematically rigorous set of results related to their performance. As it\nwill turn out, many of the statistical mechanics predictions obtained for\ndiscrete predictions will in fact appear as mathematically provable bounds.\nThis will in a way emulate a similar type of behavior we observed in\n\\cite{StojnicGardGen13,StojnicGardSphNeg13,StojnicGardSphErr13} when studying\nspherical perceptrons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Jun 2013 11:05:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-20"}

Contrary to popular belief, this\ncontradiction affects not only classical but also quantum statistical\nmechanics. The present paper resolves the GP1 by considering two effects: 1.\nThe uncertainty about which particles are located in S1 and which in S2\ncontributes to the entropies of S1 and S2. 2. S1 and S2 are correlated by the\nfact that if a certain particle is located in one system, it cannot be located\nin the other. As a consequence, the entropy of the total system consisting of\nS1 and S2 is not the sum of the entropies of S1 and S2.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Jun 2013 04:54:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Oct 2013 15:32:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-19"}
