We\nconsider random models of fitness landscapes, where fitness values are assigned\naccording to some probabilistic rule, and study the statistical properties of\npathways to the global fitness maximum along which fitness increases\nmonotonically. Such paths are important for evolution because they are the only\nones that are accessible to an adapting population when mutations occur at a\nlow rate. The focus of this work is on the block model introduced by A.S.\nPerelson and C.A. Macken [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 92:9657 (1995)] where the\ngenome is decomposed into disjoint sets of loci (`modules') that contribute\nindependently to fitness, and fitness values within blocks are assigned at\nrandom. We show that the number of accessible paths can be written as a product\nof the path numbers within the blocks, which provides a detailed analytic\ndescription of the path statistics. The block model can be viewed as a special\ncase of Kauffman's NK-model, and we compare the analytic results to simulations\nof the NK-model with different genetic architectures. We find that the mean\nnumber of accessible paths in the different versions of the model are quite\nsimilar, but the distribution of the path number is qualitatively different in\nthe block model due to its multiplicative structure. A similar statement\napplies to the number of local fitness maxima in the NK-models, which has been\nstudied extensively in previous works. The overall evolutionary accessibility\nof the landscape, as quantified by the probability to find at least one\naccessible path to the global maximum, is dramatically lowered by the modular\nstructure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Jun 2013 16:02:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Oct 2013 10:14:46 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 4 Feb 2014 12:45:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

We also separate the energy-momentum\nconservation equation into two conservation equations, one for matter and the\nother for dark energy. We perform this procedure for different cases, without\ninteracting term and with two particular (suitable) interacting terms between\nthe two parts. By assuming the parameter of the state equation for dark energy\nto be constant, the equations of the model admit the power-law solutions.\nThough, the non-interacting case does not give any accelerated universe, but\nthe interacting cases give both decelerated and accelerated universes.

It\nis well known that, without additional assumptions, rendezvous is impossible if\nthe entities are oblivious (i.e., have no persistent memory) even if the system\nis semi-synchronous (SSynch). It has been recently shown that rendezvous is\npossible even if the system is asynchronous (ASynch) if each robot is endowed\nwith O(1) bits of persistent memory, can transmit O(1) bits in each cycle, and\ncan remember (i.e., can persistently store) the last received transmission.\nThis setting is overly powerful.\n  In this paper we weaken that setting in two different ways: (1) by\nmaintaining the O(1) bits of persistent memory but removing the communication\ncapabilities; and (2) by maintaining the O(1) transmission capability and the\nability to remember the last received transmission, but removing the ability of\nan agent to remember its previous activities. We call the former setting\nfinite-state (FState) and the latter finite-communication (FComm). Note that,\neven though its use is very different, in both settings, the amount of\npersistent memory of a robot is constant.\n  We investigate the rendezvous problem in these two weaker settings. We model\nboth settings as a system of robots endowed with visible lights: in FState, a\nrobot can only see its own light, while in FComm a robot can only see the other\nrobot's light. We prove, among other things, that finite-state robots can\nrendezvous in SSynch, and that finite-communication robots are able to\nrendezvous even in ASynch. All proofs are constructive: in each setting, we\npresent a protocol that allows the two robots to rendezvous in finite time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Jun 2013 20:34:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-11"}

In the\nsuperconducting state, the impurities may generate a unique pattern of local\ndensity of states in space and energy, which are regarded as the fingerprints\nfor checking the structure of the pairing gap. In this study, we successfully\nidentified the non-magnetic and magnetic impurities in Na(Fe0.97-xCo0.03Tx)As\n(T=Cu, Mn) and investigated the spatial resolved scanning tunneling\nspectroscopy. We present clear evidence of the in-gap quasiparticle states\ninduced by the nonmagnetic Cu impurities, giving decisive evidence of the S+-\npairing. This is corroborated by the consistency between the experimental data\nand the first-principles calculations based on the S+- pairing gap with a\nscalar scattering potential.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Jun 2013 09:46:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Nov 2013 09:40:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-18"}

This noise provides a granular aspect to the image, making its\nprocessing and analysis (such as in edge detection) hard tasks. This paper\ndiscusses seven methods for edge detection in multilook PolSAR images. In all\nmethods, the basic idea consists in detecting transition points in the finest\npossible strip of data which spans two regions. The edge is contoured using the\ntransitions points and a B-spline curve. Four stochastic distances, two\ndifferences of entropies, and the maximum likelihood criterion were used under\nthe scaled complex Wishart distribution; the first six stem from the h-phi\nclass of measures. The performance of the discussed detection methods was\nquantified and analyzed by the computational time and probability of correct\nedge detection, with respect to the number of looks, the backscatter matrix as\na whole, the SPAN, the covariance an the spatial resolution. The detection\nprocedures were applied to three real PolSAR images.

However, these results are highly sensitive to the underlying\nassumption on 'static' or 'fixed' system conditions. For example, if channel\nconditions are time-varying, it is unclear how each node can adjust its CSMA\nparameters, so-called backoff and channel holding times, using its local\nchannel information for the desired high performance. In this paper, we study\n'channel-aware' CSMA (A-CSMA) algorithms in time-varying channels, where they\nadjust their parameters as some function of the current channel capacity.\nFirst, we show that the achievable rate region of A-CSMA equals to the maximum\nrate region if and only if the function is exponential. Furthermore, given an\nexponential function in A-CSMA, we design updating rules for their parameters,\nwhich achieve throughput optimality for an arbitrary wireless network topology.\nThey are the first CSMA algorithms in the literature which are proved to be\nthroughput optimal under time-varying channels. Moreover, we also consider the\ncase when back-off rates of A- CSMA are highly restricted compared to the speed\nof channel variations, and characterize the throughput performance of A-CSMA in\nterms of the underlying wireless network topology. Our results not only guide a\nhigh-performance design on MAC scheduling under highly time-varying scenarios,\nbut also provide new insights on the performance of CSMA algorithms in relation\nto their backoff rates and the network topology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Jun 2013 11:53:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-11"}

As the starting point, we show that\nquasi-surely, sample paths of G-Brownian motion can be enhanced to the second\nlevel in a canonical way so that they become geometric rough paths of roughness\n2 < p < 3. This result enables us to introduce the notion of rough differential\nequations (RDEs) driven by G-Brownian motion in the pathwise sense under the\ngeneral framework of rough paths. Next we establish the fundamental relation\nbetween SDEs and RDEs driven by G-Brownian motion. As an application, we\nintroduce the notion of SDEs on a differentiable manifold driven by GBrownian\nmotion and construct solutions from the RDE point of view by using pathwise\nlocalization technique. This is the starting point of introducing G-Brownian\nmotion on a Riemannian manifold, based on the idea of Eells-Elworthy-Malliavin.\nThe last part of this paper is devoted to such construction for a wide and\ninteresting class of G-functions whose invariant group is the orthogonal group.\nWe also develop the Euler-Maruyama approximation for SDEs driven by G-Brownian\nmotion of independent interest.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Jun 2013 14:04:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-11"}

Rational decision\nmaking involves using information which is almost always imperfect and\nincomplete together with some intelligent machine which if it is a human being\nis inconsistent to make decisions. In bounded rationality, this decision is\nmade irrespective of the fact that the information to be used is incomplete and\nimperfect and that the human brain is inconsistent and thus this decision that\nis to be made is taken within the bounds of these limitations. In the theory of\nflexibly-bounded rationality, advanced information analysis is used, the\ncorrelation machine is applied to complete missing information and artificial\nintelligence is used to make more consistent decisions. Therefore\nflexibly-bounded rationality expands the bounds within which rationality is\nexercised. Because human decision making is essentially irrational, this paper\nproposes the theory of marginalization of irrationality in decision making to\ndeal with the problem of satisficing in the presence of irrationality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Jun 2013 14:58:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-11"}

It is host to a variety of supernova\nprogenitors and is therefore very important for galactic chemical evolution and\nstellar population studies.

Of the models that ignite neon burning off-center, the 9.5Mo model\nwould evolve to an FeCCSN after the neon-burning shell propagates to the\ncenter, as in previous studies. The neon-burning shell in the 8.8Mo model,\nhowever, fails to reach the center as the URCA process and an extended (0.6 Mo)\nregion of low Ye (0.48) in the outer part of the core begin to dominate the\nlate evolution; the model evolves to an EC-SN. This is the first study to\nfollow the most massive EC-SN progenitors to collapse, representing an\nevolutionary path to EC-SN in addition to that from SAGB stars undergoing\nthermal pulses. We also present models of an 8.75Mo super-AGB star through its\nentire thermal pulse phase until electron captures on 20Ne begin at its center\nand of a 12Mo star up to the iron core collapse. We discuss key uncertainties\nand how the different pathways to collapse affect the pre-supernova structure.\nFinally, we compare our results to the observed neutron star mass distribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Jun 2013 15:45:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}
