Fewer successful walks and\nshorter successful walks point to higher communication specificity between\nprotein residues, a conceivably favourable attribute for proteins to have. The\nuse of random walks instead of shortest paths also produced lower node\ncentrality, lower edge betweeness and lower edge load for (non-randomized)\nprotein residue networks than in their respective randomized counterparts. The\nimplications of these properties for protein residue networks are discussed in\nterms of communication congestion and network vulnerability.

Hence, our findings also shed light\non a hitherto neglected aspect: the importance of high network clustering in\nprotein residue networks.

We also present\nupdated versions of the GC specific frequency S_N and specific mass S_M versus\nhost galaxy luminosity and baryonic mass. These graphs exhibit the previously\nknown U-shape: highest S_N or S_M values occur for either dwarfs or\nsupergiants, but in the midrange of galaxy size (10^9 - 10^10 L_Sun) the GC\nnumbers fall along a well defined baseline value of S_N ~ 1 or S_M ~ 0.1,\nsimilar among all galaxy types. Along with other recent discussions, we suggest\nthat this trend may represent the effects of feedback, which systematically\ninhibited early star formation at either very low or very high galaxy mass, but\nwhich had its minimum effect for intermediate masses. Our results strongly\nreinforce recent proposals that GC formation efficiency appears to be most\nnearly proportional to the galaxy halo mass M_halo. The mean \"absolute\"\nefficiency ratio for GC formation that we derive from the catalog data is\nM_GCS/M_halo = 6 \\times 10^-5. We suggest that the galaxy-to-galaxy scatter\naround this mean value may arise in part because of differences in the relative\ntiming of GC formation versus field-star formation.

However, the calculations of TPE corrections\nhave significant model dependence, and there is limited direct experimental\nevidence for such corrections. We present the results of a new experimental\ntechnique for making direct $e^\\pm p$ comparisons, which has the potential to\nmake precise measurements over a broad range in $Q^2$ and scattering angles. We\nuse the Jefferson Lab electron beam and the Hall B photon tagger to generate a\nclean but untagged photon beam. The photon beam impinges on a converter foil to\ngenerate a mixed beam of electrons, positrons, and photons. A chicane is used\nto separate and recombine the electron and positron beams while the photon beam\nis stopped by a photon blocker. This provides a combined electron and positron\nbeam, with energies from 0.5 to 3.2 GeV, which impinges on a liquid hydrogen\ntarget. The large acceptance CLAS detector is used to identify and reconstruct\nelastic scattering events, determining both the initial lepton energy and the\nsign of the scattered lepton. The data were collected in two days with a\nprimary electron beam energy of only 3.3 GeV, limiting the data from this run\nto smaller values of $Q^2$ and scattering angle. Nonetheless, this measurement\nyields a data sample for $e^\\pm p$ with statistics comparable to those of the\nbest previous measurements. We have shown that we can cleanly identify elastic\nscattering events and correct for the difference in acceptance for electron and\npositron scattering. The final ratio of positron to electron scattering:\n$R=1.027\\pm0.005\\pm0.05$ for $<Q^2>=0.206$ GeV$^2$ and $0.830\\leq \\epsilon\\leq\n0.943$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Jun 2013 19:09:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Jul 2013 18:10:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-04"}

Hot gas in clusters, groups and\nthe intergalactic medium dominates the baryonic content of the local Universe.\nTo understand the astrophysical processes responsible for the formation and\nassembly of these large structures, it is necessary to measure their physical\nproperties and evolution. This requires spatially resolved X-ray spectroscopy\nwith a factor 10 increase in both telescope throughput and spatial resolving\npower compared to currently planned facilities. Feedback from supermassive\nblack holes is an essential ingredient in this process and in most galaxy\nevolution models, but it is not well understood. X-ray observations can\nuniquely reveal the mechanisms launching winds close to black holes and\ndetermine the coupling of the energy and matter flows on larger scales. Due to\nthe effects of feedback, a complete understanding of galaxy evolution requires\nknowledge of the obscured growth of supermassive black holes through cosmic\ntime, out to the redshifts where the first galaxies form. X-ray emission is the\nmost reliable way to reveal accreting black holes, but deep survey speed must\nimprove by a factor ~100 over current facilities to perform a full census into\nthe early Universe. The Advanced Telescope for High Energy Astrophysics\n(Athena+) mission provides the necessary performance (e.g. angular resolution,\nspectral resolution, survey grasp) to address these questions and revolutionize\nour understanding of the Hot and Energetic Universe. These capabilities will\nalso provide a powerful observatory to be used in all areas of astrophysics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Jun 2013 20:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-04"}

We have generated average HI line profiles in a number of nearby\ndwarfs and low-mass spirals by co-adding HI spectra in regions with either a\ncommon radius or SFRSD. We find that the spatially-resolved superprofiles are\ncomposed of a central narrow peak (5-15 km/s) with higher velocity wings to\neither side. With the assumption that the central peak reflects the turbulent\nvelocity dispersion, we compare HI kinematics to local ISM properties,\nincluding surface mass densities and measures of SF. The HI velocity dispersion\nis correlated most strongly with surface mass density, which points at a\ngravitational origin for turbulence, but it is unclear which instabilities can\noperate efficiently in these systems. SF energy is produced at a level\nsufficient to drive HI turbulent motions where SFRSD > 10^-4 Msun yr^-1 kpc^-2.\nAt low SF intensities, SF does not supply enough energy for turbulence, nor\ndoes it uniquely determine the velocity dispersion. Nevertheless, SF appears to\nprovide a lower threshold for HI velocity dispersions. We find that coupling\nefficiency decreases with increasing SFRSD, consistent with a picture where SF\ncouples to the ISM with constant efficiency, but that less of that energy is\nfound in HI at higher SFRSD. We examine a number of potential drivers of HI\nturbulence, including SF, gravitational instabilities, the magnetorotational\ninstability, and accretion, and find that no single mechanism can drive the\nobserved levels of turbulence at low SFRSD.

The Athena+ Wide Field Imager will enable X-ray surveys to\nbe carried out two orders of magnitude faster than with Chandra or XMM-Newton,\nopening a new discovery space and identifying over 400 z>6 AGN, including\nobscured sources. Athena+ will also play a fundamental role to enhance the\nscientific return of future multiwavelength facilities that will probe the\nphysical conditions within the host galaxies of early SMBHs, which is vital for\nunderstanding how SMBHs form, what fuels their subsequent growth, and to assess\ntheir impact on the early Universe. Follow-up of samples of z>6 galaxies with\nthe Athena+ X-ray Integral Field Unit could also reveal the presence of highly\nobscured AGNs, thanks to the detection of strong iron lines. Thus, Athena+ will\nenable the first quantitative measurements of the extent and distribution of\nSMBH accretion in the early Universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Jun 2013 20:01:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-12"}

Augmented by data from the Wide-field\nInfrared Survey Explorer (WISE), we identify 96 candidate disk bearing young\nstellar objects (YSOs) in the region. Of these, 30 are clearly Class I or\nearlier.

We study detailed light curves and color trajectories of ~50 of the YSOs\nin the monitored field. We investigate the variability and periodicity of the\nYSOs and find the data are consistent with all YSOs being variable in these\nwavelengths on time scales of a few years. We divide the variability into four\nobservational classes: 1) stars with periodic variability stable over long\ntimescales, 2) variables which exhibit short-lived cyclic behavior, 3) long\nduration variables, and 4) stochastic variables. Some YSO variability defies\nsimple classification. We can explain much of the observed variability as being\ndue to dynamic and rotational changes in the disk, including an asymmetric or\nchanging blocking fraction, changes to the inner disk hole size, as well as\nchanges to the accretion rate. Overall, we find that the Class I:Class II ratio\nof the cluster is consistent with an age of < 1Myr, with at least one\nindividual, wildly varying, source ~ 100,000 yr old.

We\npropose a tentative subdivision of our sample ETGs into two groups, according\nto their Ha equivalent width (EW) and Lyman continuum (LyC) photon escape\nfraction (PLF). Type i ETGs show nearly constant EWs and a PLF~0, suggesting\nthat photoionization by post-AGB stars is the main driver of their faint\nextranuclear nebular emission. Type ii ETGs are characterized by very low,\noutwardly increasing EWs, and a PLF as large as ~0.9 in their centers. Such\nproperties point to a low, and inwardly decreasing WIM density and/or volume\nfilling factor. We argue that, because of extensive LyC photon leakage,\nemission-line luminosities and EWs are reduced in type ii ETG nuclei by at\nleast one order of magnitude. Consequently, the line weakness of these ETGs is\nby itself no compelling evidence for their containing merely \"weak\"\n(sub-Eddington accreting) active galactic nuclei (AGN). In fact, LyC photon\nescape, which has heretofore not been considered, may constitute a key element\nin understanding why many ETGs with prominent signatures of AGN activity in\nradio continuum and/or X-ray wavelengths show only faint emission lines and\nweak signatures of AGN activity in their optical spectra. The LyC photon\nescape, in conjunction with dilution of nuclear EWs by line-of-sight\nintegration through a triaxial stellar host, can systematically impede\ndetection of AGN in gas-poor galaxy spheroids through optical emission-line\nspectroscopy. We further find that type i and ii ETGs differ little (~0.4 dex)\nin their mean BPT line ratios, which in both cases are characteristic of\nLINERs. This potentially hints at a degeneracy of the projected,\nluminosity-weighted BPT ratios for the specific 3D properties of the WIM in\nETGs.

These tools\ngenerally come in form of diagnostic ratios/diagrams that are based on grids of\nphotoionisation models. An important input to the photoionisation models is the\nstellar atmosphere spectrum of the ionising sources. The current omission of\nshocks in the calculation of the former set of models could threaten the\naccuracy of the physical interpretation of emission line ratios from Hii\nregions. Current stellar atmosphere models that are crucial inputs to the grid\nof photoionisation models used to generate nebular emission line diagnostic\ndiagrams might produce significant biases due to the omission of shocks. We\ninvestigate whether a new generation of photoionisation model grids, taking\nshocks into account, is required to compensate for the biases. We make use of\nthe WM-Basic stellar atmosphere code, which can account for the extra energetic\nemission in the stellar spectral energy distribution produced by shocks, in\nconjunction with the photoionisation code MOCASSIN to determine whether shocks\nproduce significant biases in the determination of the physical parameters of\nthe interstellar medium and/or ionising stellar parameters. We conclude that\nthese effects are only important for stellar sources with effective\ntemperatures lower than 30kK and in this case they yield artificially high\nstellar temperatures, electron temperatures and nebular ionisation parameters.\nThe magnitude of the effect is also obviously dependent on the strength of the\nshock and is likely to be unimportant for the majority of stellar sources.\nNevertheless, we find our 20kK and 30kK shock models to strongly enhance the He\nii 4686 nebular emission line.

On the streaming side, different\nvideo streams may generate variable-bit-rate traffic with different traffic\npatterns. On the network side, the wireless transmissions are unreliable, and\nthe link qualities differ from client to client. In order to alleviate the\nabove stochastic aspects of both video streams and link unreliability, each\nclient typically buffers incoming packets before playing the video. The quality\nof the video playback subscribed to by each flow depends, among other factors,\non both the delay of packets as well as their throughput.\n  In this paper we characterize precisely the capacity of the wireless video\nserver in terms of what combination of joint per-packet-delays and throughputs\ncan be supported for the set of flows, as a function of the buffering delay\nintroduced at the server.\n  We also address how to schedule packets at the access point to satisfy the\njoint per-packet-delay-throughput performance measure.

In this regime, the\neikonal approximation is valid, so is employed to calculate the cross-section\nfor the reaction. Due to the high-energy nature of the FSIs, the maxima of the\nrescatterings are located at nearly transverse directions of the fast hadrons.\nThis results in two peaks in the angular distribution of the spectator nucleon,\neach corresponding to either the $V$-$N$ or the $p$-$n$ rescattering. The\n$V$-$N$ peak provides a new means of probing the $V$-$N$ interaction. This is\nchecked for near-threshold $\\phi$ and $J/\\Psi$ photoproduction reactions which\ndemonstrate that the $V$-$N$ peak can be used to extract the largely unknown\namplitudes of $\\phi$-$N$ and $J/\\Psi$-$N$ interactions.\n  Two additional phenomena are observed when extending the calculation of\n$J/\\Psi$ photoproduction to the sub-threshold and high-energy domains.

The 4.5 micron\nfilter contains the same dust grains, as well as strong emission lines from CO2\nand CO gas; these show distinct morphologies, in which cases we infer they are\ndominated by gas. Based on the ratio of 4.5 to 3.6 micron brightness, we\nclassify the survey comets as CO2+CO \"rich\" and \"poor.\" This classification is\ncorrelated with previous classifications by A'Hearn based on carbon-chain\nmolecule abundance, in the sense that comets classified as \"depleted\" in\ncarbon-chain molecules are also \"poor\" in CO2+CO.

Here we apply Schrodinger's first-passage-time distribution\nformula to the data set in [1]. It is found that Schrodinger's formula can be\nused to describe the time distribution of DNA translocation in solid-state\nnanopores. These fittings yield two useful parameters: drift velocity of DNA\ntranslocation and diffusion constant of DNA inside the nanopore. The results\nsuggest two regimes of DNA translocation: (I) at low voltages, there are clear\ndeviations from Smoluchowski's linear law of electrophoresis [6] which we\nattribute to the entropic barrier effects; (II) at high voltages, the\ntranslocation velocity is a linear function of the applied electric field. In\nregime II, the apparent diffusion constant exhibits a quadratic dependence on\napplied electric field, suggesting a mechanism of Taylor dispersion effect\nlikely due the electro-osmotic flow field in the nanopore channel. This\nanalysis yields a dispersion-free diffusion constant value for the segment of\nDNA inside the nanopore which is in agreement with Stokes-Einstein theory\nquantitatively.

Next, we summarize key mechanisms by which the circulation\naffects the global-mean climate, and hence planetary habitability.

As a complication, studies on the connection\nbetween Hi line widths and SF in external galaxies often use broadband tracers\nfor the SF rate, which must implicitly assume that SF histories (SFHs) have\nbeen constant over the timescale of the tracer. In this paper, we compare\nmeasures of HI energy to time-resolved SFHs in a number of nearby dwarf\ngalaxies. We find that HI energy surface density is strongly correlated only\nwith SF that occurred 30-40 Myr ago. This timescale corresponds to the\napproximate lifetime of the lowest mass supernova progenitors (~ 8 Msun). This\nanalysis suggests that the coupling between SF and the neutral ISM is strongest\non this timescale, due either to an intrinsic delay between the release of the\npeak energy from SF or to the coherent effects of many SNe during this\ninterval. At \\Sigma_SFR > 10^-3 Msun yr^-1 kpc^-2, we find a mean coupling\nefficiency between SF energy and HI energy of \\epsilon = 0.11 +/- 0.04 using\nthe 30-40 Myr timescale.

Our strategy to overcome this\ndifficulty and allow a consistent use of all neutrino data in global PDF\nanalyses is to normalize the data by the integrated cross-sections thereby\ncancelling possible inaccuracies in the absolute normalization. Indeed, this\nbrings all data to a surprisingly good mutual agreement underscoring the\nx-dependence of the nuclear modifications in a model-independent way. The\nconsistency of these data with the present nuclear PDFs is verified by\nintroducing a method to test the effect of a new data set in an existing global\nfit that performed a Hessian error analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Jun 2013 06:27:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-12"}

In order to investigate the magnetic structures related\nto the M6.6 event, particularly the formation process of a flare-triggering\nmagnetic region, we analyzed multiple spacecraft observations and numerical\nresults of a flare simulation. We observed that, in the center of this\nquadrupolar AR, a highly sheared polarity inversion line (PIL) was formed\nthrough proper motions of the major magnetic elements, which built a sheared\ncoronal arcade lying over the PIL. The observations lend support to the\ninterpretation that the target flare was triggered by a localized magnetic\nregion that had an intrusive structure, namely a positive polarity penetrating\ninto a negative counterpart. The geometrical relationship between the sheared\ncoronal arcade and the triggering region was consistent with the theoretical\nflare model based on the previous numerical study. We found that the formation\nof the trigger region was due to a continuous accumulation of the small-scale\nmagnetic patches. A few hours before the flare occurrence, the series of\nemerged/advected patches reconnected with a preexisting fields. Finally, the\nabrupt flare eruption of the M6.6 event started around 17:30 UT.

We consider such graphs that\nadditionally have expansion properties, parameterized by the spectral gap\nand/or the girth of the graphs.\n  The general flavor of our results is that sufficiently strong expansion\n(e.g., $\\lambda(G)=O(\\sqrt{d})$, or girth $\\Omega(\\log \\log d)$) implies that\n$m(G,2) \\le O(\\frac{n}{d^2})$ (and more generally, $m(G,r) \\le\nO(\\frac{n}{d^{r/(r-1)}})$). Significantly weaker expansion properties suffice\nin order to imply that $m(G,2)\\le O(\\frac{n \\log d}{d^2})$. For example, we\nshow this for graphs of girth at least~7, and for graphs with\n$\\lambda(G)<(1-\\epsilon)d$, provided the graph has no 4-cycles. Nearly\n$d$-regular expander graphs can be obtained by considering the binomial random\ngraph $G(n,p)$ with $p \\simeq \\frac{d}{n}$ and $d > \\log n$. For such graphs we\nprove that $\\Omega(\\frac{n}{d^2 \\log d}) \\le m(G,2) \\le O(\\frac{n\\log\\log\nd}{d^2\\log d})$ almost surely.\n  Our results are algorithmic, entailing simple and efficient algorithms for\nselecting contagious sets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Jun 2013 09:48:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Feb 2014 16:20:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-11"}

In this paper, we study in details\nthe dynamics of inner core thermal convection when dynamically induced melting\nand freezing of the inner core boundary (ICB) are taken into account. If the\ninner core is unstably stratified, linear stability analysis and numerical\nsimulations consistently show that the translation mode dominates only if the\nviscosity $\\eta$ is large enough, with a critical viscosity value, of order $3\n10^{18}$ Pas, depending on the ability of outer core convection to supply or\nremove the latent heat of melting or solidification. If $\\eta$ is smaller, the\ndynamical effect of melting and freezing is small. Convection takes a more\nclassical form, with a one-cell axisymmetric mode at the onset and chaotic\nplume convection at large Rayleigh number.

We argue however that the formation of an iron-rich layer\nabove the ICB may have a positive feedback on inner core convection: it implies\nthat the inner core crystallized from an increasingly iron-rich liquid,\nresulting in an unstable compositional stratification which could drive inner\ncore convection, perhaps even if the inner core is subadiabatic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Jun 2013 10:35:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

Many networks, however, possess\nlarge-scale modular structures that can drastically influence their spectral\ncharacteristics, and which are neglected in such simplified descriptions.

For the first V/R variation event, we analyze the spectroscopic\nbehaviors of emission lines and shell absorption lines of the Balmer series.\nThe V/R variations of the H_alpha through H_delta lines are characterized by\nthe different manner of variations of the individual emission lines in time lag\nand in duration of the V/R phases. Weak correlation is also notable between the\nV/R variations and other variations of the line-profile parameter such as the\npeak velocities, emission line intensities and peak separations.

However, self-gravitating disc-satellite interaction can\nlead to the formation of a gravitationally unstable gap. Such an instability\nsignificantly affects the orbital migration of gap-opening perturbers in\nmassive discs. We use 2D hydrodynamical simulations to examine the role of\nplanet mass on the gravitational stability of gaps and its impact on orbital\nmigration. We consider giant planets with planet-to-star mass ratio q=0.0003 to\nq=0.003, in a self-gravitating disc with disc-to-star mass ratio M_d/M_*=0.08,\naspect ratio h=0.05, and Keplerian Toomre parameter Q = 1.5 at 2.5 times the\nplanet's initial orbital radius. Fixed-orbit simulations show that all planet\nmasses we consider open gravitationally unstable gaps, but the instability is\nstronger and develops sooner with increasing planet mass. The disc-on-planet\ntorques typically become more positive with increasing planet mass. In\nfreely-migrating simulations, we observe faster outward migration with\nincreasing planet mass, but only for planet masses capable of opening unstable\ngaps early on. For q=0.0003, the planet undergoes rapid inward type III\nmigration before it can open a gap. For q=0.0013 we find it is possible to\nbalance the tendency for inward migration by the positive torques due to an\nunstable gap, but only for a few 10's of orbital periods. We find the unstable\nouter gap edge can trigger outward type III migration, sending the planet to\ntwice its initial orbital radius on dynamical timescales. This triggered type\nIII migration may be a way of bringing giant planets to large orbital\ndistances. On the other hand, our results also imply gap-opening is not a\nsufficient condition for the in situ formation of giant planets on wide orbits\nthrough disc fragmentation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Jun 2013 13:24:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

A three-week field survey\nover April 2010 allowed for the acquisition of a dense mesh of\nGround-penetrating Radar (GPR) data with an average of 14683 points per km2\n(67542 points total) on the glacier surface. The profiles were acquired using a\nMala equipment with 100 MHz antennas, towed slowly enough to record on average\nevery 0.3 m, a trace long enough to sound down to 189 m of ice. One profile was\nrepeated with 50 MHz antenna to improve electromagnetic wave propagation depth\nin scattering media observed in the cirques closest to the slopes. The GPR was\ncoupled to a GPS system to position traces. Each profile has been manually\nedited using standard GPR data processing including migration, to pick the\nreflection arrival time from the ice-bedrock interface. Snow cover was\nevaluated through 42 snow drilling measurements regularly spaced to cover all\nthe glacier. These data were acquired at the time of the GPR survey and\nsubsequently spatially interpolated using ordinary kriging. Using a snow\nvelocity of 0.22 m/ns, the snow thickness was converted to electromagnetic wave\ntravel-times and subtracted from the picked travel-times to the ice-bedrock\ninterface. The resulting travel-times were converted to ice thickness using a\nvelocity of 0.17 m/ns. The velocity uncertainty is discussed from a common\nmid-point profile analysis. A total of 67542 georeferenced data points with\nGPR-derived ice thicknesses, in addition to a glacier boundary line derived\nfrom satellite images taken during summer, were interpolated over the entire\nglacier surface using kriging with a 10 m grid size. Some uncertainty analysis\nwere carried on and we calculated an averaged ice thickness of 76 m and a\nmaximum depth of 164 m with a relative error of 11.9%. The volume of the\nglacier is derived as 0.3487$\\pm$0.041 km3. Finally a 10-m grid map of the\nbedrock topography was derived by subtracting the ice thicknesses from a\ndual-frequency GPS-derived digital elevation model of the surface. These two\ndatasets are the first step for modelling thermal evolution of the glacier and\nits bedrock, as well as the main hydrological network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Jun 2013 14:45:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-12"}

This behavior appears to run counter to rational models of decision\nmaking, and it is sometimes interpreted as evidence of non-rational \"motivated\nreasoning\". We consider scenarios in which this effect arises in a model of\nrational decision making which includes the possibility of deceptive\ninformation. In particular, we will consider a model in which there are two\nclasses of voters, which we will call trusting voters and suspicious voters,\nand two types of information sources, which we will call unbiased sources and\nbiased sources. In our model, new data about a candidate can be efficiently\nincorporated by a trusting voter, and anomalous updates are impossible;\nhowever, anomalous updates can be made by suspicious voters, if the information\nsource mistakenly plans for an audience of trusting voters, and if the partisan\ngoals of the information source are known by the suspicious voter to be\n\"opposite\" to his own. Our model is based on a formalism introduced by the\nartificial intelligence community called \"multi-agent influence diagrams\",\nwhich generalize Bayesian networks to settings involving multiple agents with\ndistinct goals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Jun 2013 15:45:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-12"}

The intriguing interplay between lattice, charge, spin and orbital\ndegrees of freedom leads to a complex phase diagram bounded by a nominal Mott\n(x=0) regime and a band-insulating (x=1) phase. By means of the charge\nself-consistent density functional theory (DFT) plus dynamical mean-field\ntheory (DMFT) scheme, built on a pseudopotential framework combined with a\ncontinuous-time quantum Monte-Carlo solver, we here study the one-particle\nspectral function A(k,\\omega) as well as the thermopower S(T). The computations\nmay account for the suppression of the e_g' pockets in A(k,\\omega) at lower\ndoping in line with photoemission experiments. Enhancement of the thermopower\nis verified within the present elaborate multi-orbital method to treat\ncorrelated materials. In addition, the two-particle dynamic spin susceptibility\n\\chi_s(\\omega,q) is investigated based on a simplified tight-binding approach,\nyet by including vertex contributions in the DMFT linear response. Besides the\nidentification of paramagnon branches at higher doping, a prominent high-energy\nantiferromagnetic mode close to x=0.67 is therewith identified in\n\\chi_s(\\omega,q), which can be linked to extended hopping terms on the CoO_2\nsublattice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Jun 2013 15:46:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-22"}

By increasing the deposition pressure from 2 to 9 mTorr while keeping\na nearly stoichiometric composition of Ti(1-x)N(x) (x=0.5), the film\nresistivity increases, the dominant crystal orientation changes from (100) to\n(111), grain boundaries become clearer, and the strong compressive strain\nchanges to weak tensile strain. The TiN films absorb a high concentration of\ncontaminants including hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen when they are exposed to\nair after deposition. With the target-substrate distance set to 88 mm the\ncontaminant levels increase from ~0.1% to ~10% as the pressure is increased\nfrom 2 to 9 mTorr. The contaminant concentrations also correlate with in-plane\ndistance from the center of the substrate and increase by roughly two orders of\nmagnitude as the target-substrate distance is increased from 88 mm to 266 mm.\nThese contaminants are found to strongly influence the properties of TiN films.\nFor instance, the resistivity of stoichiometric films increases by around a\nfactor of 5 as the oxygen content increases from 0.1% to 11%. These results\nsuggest that the sputtered TiN particle energy is critical in determining the\nTiN film properties, and that it is important to control this energy to obtain\nhigh-quality TiN films.
