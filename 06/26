The dif- feomorphism covariant\nkinematics is based on states which carry a continuous label corresponding to\nsmooth embedding geometries, in addition to the discrete embedding and matter\nlabels. The physical state space, obtained through group averaging procedure,\nis nonseparable. A physical state in this theory can be interpreted as a\nquantum spacetime, which is composed of discrete strips and supercedes the\nclassical continuum. We find that the conformal group is broken in the quantum\ntheory, and consists of all Poincare translations. These features are\nremarkably different compared to the case without a smooth embedding. Finally,\nwe analyse the length operator whose spectrum is shown to be a sum of\ncontributions from the continuous and discrete embedding geometries, being in\nperfect analogy with the spectra of geometrical operators in LQG with a\nnondegenerate vacuum geometry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Jun 2013 16:00:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Sep 2013 15:19:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-12"}

We measure, for both circular and half-circle shapes, the forces\nparallel (drag) and perpendicular (lift) to the drag direction as functions of\nthe drag speed, with V=10.3-309 cm/s, and intruder depths, with D=3.75-37.5 cm.\nThe drag forces on an intruder monotonically increase with V and D, and are\nlarger for the circle. However, the lift force does not depend monotonically on\nV and D, and this relationship is affected by the shape of the intruder. The\nvertical force was negative for the half-circle, but for a small range of V and\nD, we measure positive lift. We find no sign change for the lift on the circle,\nwhich is always positive. The explanation for the nonmonotonic dependence is\nrelated to the decrease in contacts on the intruder as V increases. This is\nqualitatively similar to supersonic flow detachment from an obstacle. The\ndetachment picture is supported by simulation measurements of the velocity\nfield around the intruder and force profiles measured on its surface.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Jun 2013 17:15:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 Jul 2013 11:32:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-19"}

More recently, practical satisfiability procedures (aka SMT\nsolvers) for these formulas have become increasingly important in the context\nof security analysis for string-manipulating programs such as web applications.\n  We prove three main theorems. First, we give a new proof of undecidability\nfor the validity problem for the set of sentences written as a forall-exists\nquantifier alternation applied to positive word equations. A corollary of this\nundecidability result is that this set is undecidable even with sentences with\nat most two occurrences of a string variable. Second, we consider Boolean\ncombinations of quantifier-free formulas constructed out of word equations and\nlength constraints. We show that if word equations can be converted to a solved\nform, a form relevant in practice, then the satisfiability problem for Boolean\ncombinations of word equations and length constraints is decidable. Third, we\nshow that the satisfiability problem for quantifier-free formulas over word\nequations in regular solved form, length constraints, and the membership\npredicate over regular expressions is also decidable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Jun 2013 18:25:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-26"}

The impulsive phase of the flare starts with a main elongated\nsource that darkens in D3, inside of which bright emission kernels appear at\nthe time of the initial small peak in hard X-rays (HXRs).

We\nexplore whether long-term stable orbits are compatible with the data by\nintegrating 8$\\times 10^4$ solutions derived from the Bayesian samplings. The\nsystem consisting of six planets is compatible with dynamically stable\nconfigurations. As for the solar system, the most stable solutions do not\ncontain mean-motion resonances and are described well by analytic\nLaplace-Lagrange solutions. The presence of a seventh planet (h) is supported\nby the fact that it appears squarely centered on the only island of stability\nleft in the six-planet solution. Habitability assessments accounting for the\nstellar flux, as well as tidal dissipation effects, indicate that three (maybe\nfour) planets are potentially habitable...\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Jun 2013 19:59:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-26"}

To validate this\napproach, it is important to check that no excessive thermodynamic fluctuations\narise as a consequence of the partially incomplete treatment of radiative\ntransfer. We investigate the realism of 3D convection simulations carried out\nwith the Stagger code. We compared the characteristic properties of several\nspectral lines in solar disc centre observations with spectra synthesized from\nthe simulations. We degraded the synthetic spectra to the spatial resolution of\nthe observations using the continuum intensity distribution. We estimated the\nnecessary spectral degradation by comparing atlas spectra with averaged\nobserved spectra. In addition to deriving a set of line parameters directly, we\nused the SIR code to invert the spectra. Most of the line parameters from the\nobservational data are matched well by the degraded simulation spectra. The\ninversions predict a macroturbulent velocity below 10 m/s for the simulation at\nfull spatial resolution, whereas they yield ~< 1000 m/s at a spatial resolution\nof 0.3\". The temperature fluctuations in the inversion of the degraded\nsimulation do not exceed those from the observational data (of the order of\n100-200 K rms for -2<log tau<-0.5). The comparison of line parameters in\nspatially averaged profiles with the averaged values of line parameters in\nspatially resolved profiles indicates a significant change of (average) line\nproperties at a spatial scale between 0.13\" and 0.3\". Up to a spatial\nresolution of 0.3\", we find no indications of the presence of excessive\nthermodynamic fluctuations in the 3D HD simulation. To definitely confirm that\nsimulations without spatial degradation contain fully realistic thermodynamic\nfluctuations requires observations at even better spatial resolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Jun 2013 21:21:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 28 Sep 2013 17:55:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

Earlier it was shown that the quasi-energy spectra of\nthese two dynamical models (i) can exactly overlap with each other if an\neffective Planck constant takes irrational multiples of 2*pi and (ii) will be\ndifferent if the same parameter takes rational multiples of 2*pi. This work\nmakes some detailed comparisons between these two models, with an effective\nPlanck constant given by 2*pi M/N, where M and N are coprime and odd integers.\nIt is found that the ORDKR spectrum (with two periodic kicking sequences having\nthe same kick strength) has one flat band and $N-1$ non-flat bands whose\nlargest width decays in power law as K to the power of N+2, where K is a\nkicking strength parameter. The existence of a flat band is strictly proven and\nthe power law scaling, numerically checked for a number of cases, is also\nanalytically proven for a three-band case. By contrast, the KHM does not have\nany flat band and its band width scales linearly with K. This is shown to\nresult in dramatic differences in dynamical behavior, such as transient (but\nextremely long) dynamical localization in ORDKR, which is absent in KHM.\nFinally, we show that despite these differences, there exist simple extensions\nof KHM and ORDKR (upon introducing an additional periodic phase parameter) such\nthat the resulting extended KHM and ORDKR are actually topologically\nequivalent, i.e., they yield exactly the same Floquet-band Chern numbers and\ndisplay topological phase transitions at the same kick strengths. A theoretical\nderivation of this topological equivalence is provided.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Jun 2013 04:55:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 Dec 2013 00:40:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-04"}

This is a dark HI object recently discovered close\nto the nearby galaxy M101. We find GBT 1355+5439 to be an HI cloud 5x3 arcmin\nin size. The total HI image and the kinematics show that the cloud consists of\ncondensations that have small (~10 km/s) motions with respect to each other.\nThe column densities of the HI are low; the observed peak value is 7.1x10^{19}\ncm^{-2}. The velocity field shows a mild velocity gradient over the body of GBT\n1355+5439, possibly due to rotation, but it may also indicate large-scale\nradial motions. Although our data are limited in sensitivity, at all positions\nthe HI velocity dispersion is higher than 5 km/s and no narrow, cold, HI\ncomponent is seen. Because its distance is not known, we considered various\npossibilities for the nature of GBT 1355+5439. Both the scenarios that it is a\ntidal remnant near M101 and that it is a dark dwarf companion of M101 meet\ndifficulties.

However, with more and more\nirregularly deployed base stations (BSs), it is becoming increasingly difficult\nto quantify the achievable network throughput or energy efficiency. In this\npaper, we develop an analytical framework for downlink performance evaluation\nof small cell networks, based on a random spatial network model, where BSs and\nusers are modeled as two independent spatial Poisson point processes. A new\nsimple expression of the outage probability is derived, which is analytically\ntractable and is especially useful with multi-antenna transmissions. This new\nresult is then applied to evaluate the network throughput and energy\nefficiency. It is analytically shown that deploying more BSs or more BS\nantennas can always increase the network throughput, but the performance gain\ncritically depends on the BS-user density ratio and the number of BS antennas.\nOn the other hand, increasing the BS density or the number of transmit antennas\nwill first increase and then decrease the energy efficiency if different\ncomponents of BS power consumption satisfy certain conditions, and the optimal\nBS density and the optimal number of BS antennas can be found. Otherwise, the\nenergy efficiency will always decrease. Simulation results shall demonstrate\nthat our conclusions based on the random network model are general and also\nhold in a regular grid-based model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Jun 2013 08:57:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-27"}

These phenomena\nare a direct consequence of the zero rest mass of gravitons, conformal\nnon-invariance of the graviton field, and one-loop finiteness of quantum\ngravity. The effects are due to graviton-ghost condensates arising from the\ninterference of quantum coherent states. Each of coherent states is a state of\ngravitons and ghosts of a wavelength of the order of the horizon scale and of\ndifferent occupation numbers. The state vector of the Universe is a coherent\nsuperposition of vectors of different occupation numbers. To substantiate the\nreliability of macroscopic quantum effects, the formalism of one-loop quantum\ngravity is discussed in detail. The theory is constructed as follows:\nFaddeev-Popov path integral in Hamilton gauge -> factorization of classical and\nquantum variables, allowing the existence of a self-consistent system of\nequations for gravitons, ghosts and macroscopic geometry -> transition to the\none-loop approximation. The ghost sector corresponding to the Hamilton gauge\nensures of one-loop finiteness of the theory off the mass shell. The\nBogolyubov-Born-Green-Kirckwood-Yvon (BBGKY) chain for the spectral function of\ngravitons renormalized by ghosts is used to build a self-consistent theory of\ngravitons in the isotropic Universe. We found three exact solutions of the\nequations, consisting of BBGKY chain and macroscopic Einstein's equations. The\nsolutions describe virtual graviton, ghost, and instanton condensates and are\nreproduced at the level of exact solutions for field operators and state\nvectors. Each exact solution corresponds to a certain phase state of\ngraviton-ghost substratum. We establish conditions under which a continuous\nquantum-gravity phase transitions occur between different phases of the\ngraviton-ghost condensate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Jun 2013 09:03:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-03"}

The combination of both,\nmorphological and spectral parameters can be used to derive source intrinsic\nphysical properties such as the magnetic field and the non-thermal particle\ndensity. In the first two papers of this series, we analyzed the single-dish\nlight curves and the VLBI kinematics of the blazar CTA 102 and suggested a\nshock-shock interaction between a traveling and a standing shock wave as a\npossible scenario to explain the observed evolution of the component associated\nto the 2006 flare. In this paper we investigate the core-shift and spectral\nevolution to test our hypothesis of a shock-shock interaction. We used 8\nmulti-frequency VLBA observations to analyze the temporal and spatial evolution\nof the spectral parameters during the flare. We observed CTA 102 between May\n2005 and April 2007 using the VLBA at six different frequencies spanning from 2\n- 86 GHz. After the calibrated VLBA images were corrected for opacity, we\nperformed a detailed spectral analysis. From the derived values we estimated\nthe magnetic field and the density of the relativistic particles. The detailed\nanalysis of the opacity shift reveals that the position of the jet core is\nproportional to nu^-1 with some temporal variations. The value suggests\npossible equipartition between magnetic field energy and particle kinetic\nenergy densities at the most compact regions. From the variation of the\nphysical parameters we deduced that the 2006 flare in CTA 102 is connected to\nthe ejection of a new traveling feature (t=2005.9) and the interaction between\nthis shock wave and a stationary structure around 0.1 mas from the core. The\nsource kinematics together with the spectral and structural variations can be\ndescribed by helical motions in an over-pressured jet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Jun 2013 11:38:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

One model for dark energy is a positive cosmological\nconstant. It is consequently of interest to study Einstein's equations with a\npositive cosmological constant coupled to matter satisfying the ordinary energy\nconditions; the dominant energy condition etc. Due to the difficulty of\nanalysing the behaviour of solutions to Einstein's equations in general, it is\ncommon to either study situations with symmetry, or to prove stability results.\nIn the present paper, we do both. In fact, we analyse, in detail, the future\nasymptotic behaviour of T^3-Gowdy symmetric solutions to the Einstein-Vlasov\nequations with a positive cosmological constant. In particular, we prove the\ncosmic no-hair conjecture in this setting. However, we also prove that the\nsolutions are future stable (in the class of all solutions). Some of the\nresults hold in a more general setting. In fact, we obtain conclusions\nconcerning the causal structure of T^2-symmetric solutions, assuming only the\npresence of a positive cosmological constant, matter satisfying various energy\nconditions and future global existence. Adding the assumption of T^3-Gowdy\nsymmetry to this list of requirements, we obtain C^0-estimates for all but one\nof the metric components. There is consequently reason to expect that many of\nthe results presented in this paper can be generalised to other types of\nmatter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Jun 2013 12:37:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 May 2016 07:31:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-13"}

We show compelling evidences\nthat the energy spectrum of the boundary layer stays virtually the same over\nfactor of 20 variations of the source luminosity. It is rather wide and cannot\nbe described by a single temperature blackbody spectrum, probably because of\nthe inhomogeneity of the boundary layer and a spread in the colour temperature.\nThe observed maximum colour temperature of the boundary/spreading layer\nemission of kT~2.4-2.6 keV is very close to the maximum observed colour\ntemperature in the photospheric radius expansion X-ray bursts, which is set by\nthe limiting Eddington flux at the neutron star surface. Observed stability of\nthe boundary layer spectrum and its maximum colour temperature strongly\nsupports theoretical models of the boundary/spreading layers on surfaces of\nluminous accreting neutron stars, which assume the presence of a region\nemitting at the local Eddington limit. Variations in the luminosity in that\ncase lead to changes in the size of this region, but affect less the spectral\nshape.

The most\nimportant effects occur at intermediate and low temperatures affecting the\nlocation of the critical end point as well as the region of first order chiral\ntransitions. When $G_V=0$ the presence of high magnetic fields ($eB \\ge 10\nm_\\pi^2$) increases the density coexistence region with respect to the case\nwhen $B$ and $G_V$ are absent while a decrease of this region is observed at\nhigh $G_V$ values and vanishing magnetic fields. Another interesting aspect\nobserved at the low temperature region is that the usual decrease of the\ncoexistence chemical value (Inverse Magnetic Catalysis) at $G_V=0$ is highly\naffected by the presence of the vector interaction which acts in the opposite\nway. Our investigation also shows that the presence of a repulsive vector\ninteraction enhances the de Haas-van Alphen oscillations which, for very low\ntemperatures, take place at $eB \\lesssim 6 m_\\pi^2$.

The importance of such a study is related to the\nrecent release of new classical Cepheids observed with HST/WFC3 in 8 distant\ngalaxies where SNIa are hosted. These observations have posed sound constraints\nto the current distance scale with uncertainties on the Hubble constant Ho\nsmaller than 3%. Our models explore a large range of metallicity and Helium\ncontent, thus providing a robust and unique theoretical tool for describing\nthese new and future HST/WFC3 observations. As expected, the Period-Luminosity\n(PL) relation in F160W filter is linear and slightly dependent on the\nmetallicity when compared with optical bands, thus it seems the most accurate\ntool to constrain extragalactic distances with Cepheids. We compare the\npulsation properties of Cepheids observed with HST/WFC3-IR with our theoretical\nscenario and we discuss the agreement with the predicted Instability Strip for\nall the investigated galaxy samples including the case of NGC4258.

Apel, et al. (KASCADE-Grande\ncollaboration), Nucl. Instrum. Methods A 620 (2010) 202] consists of, among\nothers, a large scintillator array for measurements of charged particles, Nch,\nand of an array of shielded scintillation counters used for muon counting, Nmu.\nKASCADE-Grande is optimized for cosmic ray measurements in the energy range 10\nPeV to about 2000 PeV, where exploring the composition is of fundamental\nimportance for understanding the transition from galactic to extragalactic\norigin of cosmic rays. Following earlier studies of the all-particle and the\nelemental spectra reconstructed in the knee energy range from KASCADE data [T.\nAntoni, et al. (KASCADE collaboration), Astropart. Phys. 24 (2005) 1], we have\nnow extended these measurements to beyond 200 PeV. By analysing the\ntwo-dimensional shower size spectrum Nch vs. Nmu for nearly vertical events, we\nreconstruct the energy spectra of different mass groups by means of unfolding\nmethods over an energy range where the detector is fully efficient. The\nprocedure and its results, which are derived based on the hadronic interaction\nmodel QGSJET-II-02 and which yield a strong indication for a dominance of heavy\nmass groups in the covered energy range and for a knee-like structure in the\niron spectrum at around 80 PeV, are presented. This confirms and further\nrefines the results obtained by other analyses of KASCADE-Grande data, which\nalready gave evidence for a knee-like structure in the heavy component of\ncosmic rays at about 80 PeV [W. Apel, et al. (KASCADE-Grande collaboration),\nPhys. Rev. Lett. 107 (2011) 171104].\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Jun 2013 15:57:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-27"}

The solution of the problems of the\nrelativistic center of mass, of the clock synchronization convention needed to\ndefine relativistic 3-spaces and of the elimination of the relative times in\nthe relativistic bound states leads to a description with a decoupled non-local\n(non-measurable) relativistic center of mass and with only relative variables\nfor the particles (single particle subsystems do not exist). We analyze the\nimplications for entanglement of this relativistic spatial non-separability not\nexisting in non-relativistic entanglement. Then we try to reconcile the two\nvisions showing that also at the non-relativistic level in real experiments\nonly relative variables are measured with their directions determined by the\neffective mean classical trajectories of particle beams present in the\nexperiment.
