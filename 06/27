The local population dynamics depends on sex ratio at birth, and\nallows mortality rates to differ between sexes. Furthermore, local density\ndependence induces a strong Allee effect, implying that the initial population\nmust be sufficiently large to avert rapid extinction. We address three\ndifferent initial spatial distributions for the introduced individuals; for\neach we minimize the associated cost, constrained by the requirement that the\nspecies must be restored throughout the habitat. First, we consider spatially\ninhomogeneous, unstable stationary solutions of the model's equations as\nplausible candidates for small restoration cost. Second, we use numerical\nsimulations to find the smallest cluster size, enclosing a spatially\nhomogeneous population density, that minimizes the cost of assured restoration.\nFinally, by employing simulated annealing, we minimize restoration cost among\nall possible initial spatial distributions of females and males. For biased sex\nratios, or for a significant between-sex difference in mortality, we find that\nsex-specific spatial distributions minimize the cost.

Correlations\nbeyond the mean-field can also be described in this framework, but this\nrequires an extension that treats the non-locality of the Hartree-Fock-like\npotential properly. The DOM has therefore been extended to properly describe\nground-state properties of nuclei as a function of nucleon asymmetry in\naddition to standard ingredients like elastic nucleon scattering data and level\nstructure. Predictions of nucleon correlations at larger nucleon asymmetries\ncan then be made after data at smaller asymmetries constrain the potentials\nthat represent the nucleon self-energy.

Using harmonic superspace\ntechniques we then show that the N=1 deformations can be recovered from\nelectric and magnetic FI-terms that break N=2 -> N=1, and also show that pure\nDirac mass terms can be induced by the same mechanism. We then find that the\nproposed RG-invariant is indeed preserved under N=2 duality, and thence along\nthe flow to the dual N=1 Kutasov theories. Possible phenomenological\napplications are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Jun 2013 19:40:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Jul 2013 16:57:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 4 Dec 2013 11:05:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-05"}

Transit observations of the super-Earth GJ 1214b\nrule out a cloud-free H2-dominated atmosphere, but are not able to determine\nwhether the lack of deep spectral features is due to high-altitude clouds or\nthe presence of a high mean molecular mass atmosphere. Here, we demonstrate\nthat one can unambiguously distinguish between cloudy mini-Neptunes and\nvolatile-dominated worlds based on the differences in the wing steepness and\nrelative depths of water absorption features in moderate-resolution NIR\ntransmission spectra (R~100). In a numerical retrieval study, we show for GJ\n1214b that an unambiguous distinction between a cloudy H2-dominated atmosphere\nand cloud-free H2 atmosphere will be possible if the uncertainties in the\nspectral transit depth measurements can be reduced by a factor of ~3 compared\nto the published HST WFC3 and VLT transit observations. We argue that the\nrequired precision for the distinction may be achievable with currently\navailable instrumentation by stacking 10-15 transit observations. We provide a\nscaling law that scales our quantitative results to other transiting\nsuper-Earths and Neptunes such as HD 97658b, 55 Cnc e, and GJ 436b. The\nanalysis is performed using an improved version of our Bayesian atmospheric\nretrieval framework. The new framework not only constrains the gas composition\nand cloud/haze parameters, but also determines our confidence in having\ndetected molecules and cloud/haze species through Bayesian model comparison.\nUsing the Bayesian tool, we demonstrate quantitatively that the subtle transit\ndepth variation in the Berta et al.

This suggests that the\ncross-helicity effects are important in the cases where global inhomogeneous\nflow and magnetic-field structures are present. Since such large-scale\nstructures are ubiquitous in geo/astrophysical phenomena, the cross-helicity\neffect is expected to play an important role in geo/astrophysical flows. In the\npresence of turbulent cross helicity, the mean vortical motion contributes to\nthe turbulent electromotive force.

We conducted a\nmulti-site photometric monitoring of the young open cluster h Persei that has\nan age of ~13 Myr. The observations were done in the I-band using 4 different\ntelescopes and the variability study is sensitive to periods from less than 0.2\nday to 20 days. Rotation periods are derived for 586 candidate cluster members\nover the mass range 0.4<=M/Msun<=1.4. The rotation period distribution\nindicates a sligthly higher fraction of fast rotators for the lower mass\nobjects, although the lower and upper envelopes of the rotation period\ndistribution, located respectively at ~0.2-0.3d and ~10d, are remarkably flat\nover the whole mass range. We combine this period distribution with previous\nresults obtained in younger and older clusters to model the angular momentum\nevolution of low mass stars during the PMS. The h Per cluster provides the\nfirst statistically robust estimate of the rotational period distribution of\nsolar-type and lower mass stars at the end of the PMS accretion phase (>10\nMyr). The results are consistent with models that assume significant\ncore-envelope decoupling during the angular momentum evolution to the ZAMS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Jun 2013 20:31:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

The models are\nconsistent with the observed properties of the 125 GeV Higgs-like boson as well\nas precision electroweak constraints, and predict a rich phenomenology of new\nHiggs states at the weak scale.

The major\nconcern of WaaS providers is to minimize the monetary cost of executing\nworkflows in the IaaS cloud. While there have been previous studies on this\nconcern, most of them assume static task execution time and static pricing\nscheme, and have the QoS notion of satisfying a deterministic deadline.\nHowever, cloud environment is dynamic, with performance dynamics caused by the\ninterference from concurrent executions and price dynamics like spot prices\noffered by Amazon EC2. Therefore, we argue that WaaS providers should have the\nnotion of offering probabilistic performance guarantees for individual\nworkflows on IaaS clouds. We develop a probabilistic scheduling framework\ncalled Dyna to minimize the monetary cost while offering probabilistic deadline\nguarantees. The framework includes an A*-based instance configuration method\nfor performance dynamics, and a hybrid instance configuration refinement for\nutilizing spot instances.

In the first case, we show that the\noptimal measure-and- prepare fidelity converges to the fidelity of the optimal\ncloner in the limit of large M.

In the literature, a multi-range potential was devised to\nadjust the surface tension [Sbragaglia et al., Phys. Rev. E 75, 026702 (2007)].\nHowever, it was recently found that the density ratio of the system will be\nchanged when the multi-range potential is employed to adjust the surface\ntension. A new approach is therefore proposed in the present work. The basic\nstrategy is to add a source term to the LB equation so as to tune the surface\ntension of the pseudopotential LB model. The proposed approach can guarantee\nthat the adjustment of the surface tension does not affect the mechanical\nstability condition of the pseudopotential LB model, and thus provides a\nseparate control of the surface tension and the density ratio. Meanwhile, it\nstill retains the mesoscopic feature and the computational simplicity of the\npseudopotential LB model. Numerical simulations are carried out for stationary\ndroplets, capillary waves, and droplet splashing on a thin liquid film.

The width\nof the broad Balmer line is a direct indicator of the downstream plasma\ntemperature. In case of efficient particle acceleration an appreciable fraction\nof the total kinetic energy of the plasma is channeled into CRs, therefore the\ndownstream temperature decreases and so does the broad Balmer line width. This\nwidth also depends on the level of thermal equilibration between ions and\nneutral hydrogen atoms in the downstream. Since in general in young SNR shocks\nonly a few charge exchange (CE) reactions occur before ionization,\nequilibration between ions and neutrals is not reached, and a kinetic\ndescription of the neutrals is required in order to properly compute Balmer\nemission.\n  We provide a method for the calculation of Balmer emission using a\nself-consistent description of the shock structure in the presence of neutrals\nand CRs. We use a recently developed semi-analytical approach, where neutral\nparticles, ionized plasma, accelerated particles and magnetic fields are all\ncoupled together through the mass, momentum and energy flux conservation\nequations. The distribution of neutrals is obtained from the full Boltzmann\nequation in velocity space, coupled to Maxwellian ions through ionization and\nCE processes. The computation is also improved with respect to previous work\nthanks to a better approximation for the atomic interaction rates. We find that\nfor shock speeds >2500km/s the distribution of broad neutrals never approaches\na Maxwellian and its moments differ from those of the ionized component. These\ndifferences reflect into a smaller FWHM than predicted in previous\ncalculations, where thermalization was assumed.

Evaluating the\ncovariance matrices for the linear model numerically and comparing the results\nto the cosmic shear signal we find that for a low redshift survey the total\ncovariance matrix is dominated by the contributions of the II-alignments. For a\nEuclid-like survey II-alignments still dominate over GI-alignments but they are\nmore than one order of magnitude smaller than the lensing signal. The shape of\nthe ellipticity covariance matrices is quite different in the k-k'-plane for\ncosmic shear on the one hand and intrinsic alignments on the other hand. In\ncomparison to lensing both alignment types tend to be rather elongated along\nthe diagonal k=k'. Moreover, for high multipoles (l ~ 100) intrinsic alignments\nare strongly concentrated along that diagonal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Jun 2013 11:19:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

We aim to determine the\ndynamical state of the First Hydrostatic Core candidate Cha-MMS1. We observed\nCha-MMS1 in various transitions with the APEX and Mopra telescopes. The\nmolecular emission was modeled with a radiative transfer code to derive\nconstraints on the envelope kinematics. We derive an internal luminosity of\n0.08 - 0.18 Lsol. An average velocity gradient of 3.1(0.1) km/s/pc over 0.08 pc\nis found perpendicular to the filament in which Cha-MMS1 is embedded. The\ngradient is flatter in the outer parts and at the innermost 2000 - 4000 AU.\nThese features suggest solid-body rotation beyond 4000 AU and slower,\ndifferential rotation beyond 8000 AU. The origin of the flatter gradient in the\ninnermost parts is unclear. The classical infall signature is detected in HCO+\n3-2 and CS 2-1. The radiative transfer modeling indicates a uniform infall\nvelocity in the outer parts of the envelope. An infall velocity field scaling\nwith r^(-0.5) is consistent with the data for r < 9000 AU. The infall\nvelocities are 0.1 - 0.2 km/s at r > 3300 AU and 0.04 - 0.6 km/s at r < 3300\nAU. Both the internal luminosity of Cha-MMS1 and the infall velocity field in\nits envelope are consistent with predictions of MHD simulations for the first\ncore phase. There is no evidence for a fast, large-scale outflow stemming from\nCha-MMS1 but excess emission from the high-density tracers CS 5-4, CO 6-5, and\nCO 7-6 suggests the presence of higher-velocity material at the inner core. Its\ninternal luminosity excludes Cha-MMS1 being a prestellar core. The kinematical\nproperties of its envelope are consistent with Cha-MMS1 being a first core\ncandidate or a very young Class 0 protostar.(abridged).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Jun 2013 11:52:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

Asymmetric fan\nreconnection is characterized by an asymmetric reconnection of flux past each\nspine line and a bulk flow of plasma across the null point. In contrast,\nasymmetric spine reconnection is inherently equal and opposite in how flux is\nreconnected across the fan plane. The higher modes of spine reconnection also\ninclude localized wedges of vortical flux transport in each half of the fan. In\nthis situation, two definitions for reconnection rate become appropriate: a\nlocal reconnection rate quantifying how much flux is genuinely reconnected\nacross the fan plane and a global rate associated with the net flux driven\nacross each semi-plane. Through a scaling analysis it is shown that when the\nohmic dissipation in the layer is assumed to be constant, the increase in the\nlocal rate bleeds from the global rate as the sheet deformation is increased.\nBoth models suggest that asymmetry in the current sheet dimensions will have a\nprofound effect on the reconnection rate and manner of flux transport in\nreconnection involving 3D nulls.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Jun 2013 12:18:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-28"}

The first principle calculations based on experimental\nmeasurements of the crystal lattice show that Sb2Te3 retains its Dirac surface\nstates within the low-pressure ambient phase where superconductivity was\nobserved, which indicates a strong relationship between superconductivity and\ntopology nature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Jun 2013 12:59:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-28"}

The\nvelocity dispersions and stacked particle velocity distributions of the parent\ndark matter (DM) halos are compared to the corresponding cluster dispersions\nand galaxy velocity distribution.

Here, we use general relativistic techniques to analyse the\naverage kinematics of large-scale bulk motions and compute the nonlinear\nRaychaudhuri equation of such flows. In doing so, we introduce two families of\nobservers. One at rest with the Hubble expansion and another following the\npeculiar motion. We first derive the fully nonlinear expressions of the\n\"peculiar\" Raychaudhuri equation in both frames and identify a range of\nrelative motion effects. Linearised around a Friedmann universe with\npressureless dust, the full equations reduce to a simple relation with no\nexplicit contribution from the matter component of the universe. Using\ncosmological perturbation theory, we obtain a scale-dependent formula, which\nalso incorporates the effects of universe's inhomogeneity and anisotropy. When\nthe latter are secondary, the peculiar Raychaudhuri equation can be solved\nanalytically. Also, combining the resulting expression with data from recent\npeculiar-velocity surveys, we estimate the relative deceleration/acceleration\nrates of such bulk motions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Jun 2013 13:58:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 Sep 2013 15:29:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 3 Oct 2013 15:11:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

The X-ray properties of\nHD45314 indicate that this star is a new member of the class of gamma Cas\nanalogs, the first one among the original category of Oe stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Jun 2013 14:43:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-09"}

In general, proving\ntermination needs acyclicity, unless program-specific or non-automated\nreasoning is performed. However, recent work could prove that certain loops\nterminate even without inferring acyclicity, because they traverse data\nstructures \"acyclically\". Consider a double-linked list: if it is possible to\ndemonstrate that every cycle involves both the \"next\" and the \"prev\" field,\nthen a traversal on \"next\" terminates since no cycle will be traversed\ncompletely. This paper develops a static analysis inferring field-sensitive\nreachability and cyclicity information, which is more general than existing\napproaches. Propositional formulae are computed, which describe which fields\nmay or may not be traversed by paths in the heap. Consider a tree with edges\n\"left\" and \"right\" to the left and right sub-trees, and \"parent\" to the parent\nnode: termination of a loop traversing leaf-up cannot be guaranteed by\nstate-of-the-art analyses. Instead, propositional formulae computed by this\nanalysis indicate that cycles must traverse \"parent\" and at least one between\n\"left\" and \"right\": termination is guaranteed as no cycle is traversed\ncompletely.

They attempted to demonstrate this by introducing\na dissipation-free deterministic key exchange method with two batteries and two\nswitches. In the present paper, we first show that BR's scheme is unphysical\nand that some elements of its assumptions violate basic protocols of secure\ncommunication. All our analyses are based on a technically-unlimited Eve with\ninfinitely accurate and fast measurements limited only by the laws of physics\nand statistics. For non-ideal situations and at active (invasive) attacks, the\nuncertainly principle between measurement duration and statistical errors makes\nit impossible for Eve to extract the key regardless of the accuracy or speed of\nher measurements. To show that thermodynamics and noise are essential for the\nsecurity, we crack the BR system with 100% success via passive attacks, in ten\ndifferent ways, and demonstrate that the same cracking methods do not function\nfor the KLJN scheme that employs Johnson noise to provide security underpinned\nby the Second Law of Thermodynamics.

This extended Hilbert space includes the operators\n$\\theta^{ij}$ and their conjugate momentum $\\pi_{ij}$ operators. In this\nscenario, the equations of motion for all extended phase-space coordinates with\ntheir corresponding solutions were determined and a rotational invariant NC\nNewton's second law was written. As an application, we treated a NC harmonic\noscillator constructed in this extended Hilbert space. We have showed precisely\nthat its solution is still periodic if and only if the ratio between the\nfrequencies of oscillation is a rational number. We investigated, analytically\nand numerically, the solutions of this NC oscillator in a two-dimensional\nphase-space. The result led us to conclude that noncommutativity induces a\nstable perturbation into the commutative standard oscillator and that the\nrotational symmetry is not broken. Besides, we have demonstrated through the\nequations of motion that a zero momentum $\\pi_{ij}$ originated a constant NC\nparameter, namely, $\\theta^{ij}=const.$, which changes the original variable\ncharacteristic of $\\theta^{ij}$ and reduces the phase-space of the system. This\nresult shows that the momentum $\\pi_{ij}$ is relevant and cannot be neglected\nwhen we have that $\\theta^{ij}$ is a coordinate of the system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Jun 2013 15:10:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Jul 2013 22:57:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 9 Oct 2013 17:17:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

The rules in\nperturbation theory and the path integral measure are very different for in-in\nand in-out formalisms, and thus the results which are standard in one approach\nmay not necessarily hold in the other one. We show that stationary phase\napproximation works completely different for a scalar in-in path integral.\nHence, in a cosmological background there are solutions, pseudo-instantons,\nthat allow tunneling between locally stable vacua even in infinite volume,\nwhich is counterintuitive from an in-out perspective.

Instead of bulking buying and\ninventory-centric buying, RTB mimics stock exchanges and utilises computer\nalgorithms to automatically buy and sell ads in real-time; It uses per\nimpression context and targets the ads to specific people based on data about\nthem, and hence dramatically increases the effectiveness of display\nadvertising. In this paper, we provide an empirical analysis and measurement of\na production ad exchange. Using the data sampled from both demand and supply\nside, we aim to provide first-hand insights into the emerging new impression\nselling infrastructure and its bidding behaviours, and help identifying\nresearch and design issues in such systems. From our study, we observed that\nperiodic patterns occur in various statistics including impressions, clicks,\nbids, and conversion rates (both post-view and post-click), which suggest\ntime-dependent models would be appropriate for capturing the repeated patterns\nin RTB. We also found that despite the claimed second price auction, the first\nprice payment in fact is accounted for 55.4% of total cost due to the\narrangement of the soft floor price. As such, we argue that the setting of soft\nfloor price in the current RTB systems puts advertisers in a less favourable\nposition. Furthermore, our analysis on the conversation rates shows that the\ncurrent bidding strategy is far less optimal, indicating the significant needs\nfor optimisation algorithms incorporating the facts such as the temporal\nbehaviours, the frequency and recency of the ad displays, which have not been\nwell considered in the past.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Jun 2013 15:15:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-28"}

Radiation drag will bring all the captured particles to rest on\nthis \"Eddington capture sphere,\" where they will remain suspended in an\nequilibrium state as long as the local flux of radiation does not change and\nremains at the effective Eddington value.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Jun 2013 15:59:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-16"}

Good agreement with the gravitational moments J2 and J4 is\nobtained with a model that uses a two-layer gas envelope, in which the inner\nregion is denser than the outer one, together with a small, dense core. It is\npossible to match J2 with a homogeneous envelope, but an envelope with a denser\ninner region is needed to match both moments. The two-layer envelope also gives\ngood agreement with the global oscillation data for Jupiter. In Jupiter, the\nboundary between the inner and outer envelopes occurs at 319 GPa, with an 8%\ndensity increase. In Saturn, it occurs at 227 GPa, with a 69% density increase.\nThe differences between the two planets show that the need for a density\nincrease is not due to EOS errors. It is also shown that helium enrichment\ncannot be the cause of the density increase. The phenomenon can be explained as\nthe result of enrichment of heavy elements from planetismals that were\ndispersed and mixed with the gases during planet formation. This conclusion is\nconsistent with planetary formation models like that of Pollack, et al.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Jun 2013 19:18:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-12"}
