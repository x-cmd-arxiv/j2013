To address this question, we derive computationally the optimal shape of\nan internally-forced periodic planar flagellum deforming as a travelling wave.\nThe optimum is here defined as the shape leading to a given swimming speed with\nminimum energetic cost. To calculate the energetic cost though, we consider the\nirreversible internal power expanded by the molecular motors forcing the\nflagellum, only a portion of which ending up dissipated in the fluid. This\noptimisation approach allows us to derive a family of shapes depending on a\nsingle dimensionless number quantifying the relative importance of elastic to\nviscous effects: the Sperm number.

This has led to a growth in the area of\nuncertainty quantification as well as the need to develop efficient, scalable,\nstable and convergent computational methods for solving differential equations\nwith random inputs. Stochastic Galerkin methods based on polynomial chaos\nexpansions have shown superiority to other non-sampling and many sampling\ntechniques. However, for complicated governing equations numerical\nimplementations of stochastic Galerkin methods can become non-trivial. On the\nother hand, Monte Carlo and other traditional sampling methods, are\nstraightforward to implement. However, they do not offer as fast convergence\nrates as stochastic Galerkin. Other numerical approaches are the stochastic\ncollocation (SC) methods, which inherit both, the ease of implementation of\nMonte Carlo and the robustness of stochastic Galerkin to a great deal. However,\nstochastic collocation and its powerful extensions, e.g. sparse grid stochastic\ncollocation, can simply fail to handle more levels of complication. The\nseemingly innocent Burgers equation driven by Brownian motion is such an\nexample. In this work we propose a novel enhancement to stochastic collocation\nmethods using locally improved deterministic model reduction techniques that\ncan handle this pathological example and hopefully other more complicated\nequations like Stochastic Navier-Stokes. Local improvements to reduced-order\nmodels are achieved using sensitivity analysis of the proper orthogonal\ndecomposition. Our numerical results show that the proposed technique is not\nonly reliable and robust but also very efficient.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Jun 2013 18:01:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-04"}

For the cases of saturated nodes and\nTCP-controlled long-file downloads, we provide accurate predictions of cell\nthroughputs. Similar to Bonald et al (Sigmetrics, 2008), we model a multi-cell\nWLAN under short-file downloads as \"a network of processor-sharing queues with\nstate-dependent service rates.\" Whereas the state-dependent service rates\nproposed by Bonald et al are based only on the \\textit{number} of contending\nneighbors, we employ state-dependent service rates that incorporate the the\nimpact of the overall \\textit{topology} of the network. We propose an\n\\textit{effective service rate approximation} technique and obtain good\napproximations for the \\textit{mean flow transfer delay} in each cell.

The method is based on\na new first-order approximation for Langevin diffusions that exploits\nlog-concavity to construct Markov chains with favourable convergence\nproperties. This approximation is closely related to Moreau-Yoshida\nregularisations for convex functions and uses proximity mappings instead of\ngradient mappings to approximate the continuous-time process. The proposed\nmethod complements existing MALA methods in two ways. First, the method is\nshown to have very robust stability properties and to converge geometrically\nfor many target densities for which other MALA are not geometric, or only if\nthe step size is sufficiently small. Second, the method can be applied to\nhigh-dimensional target densities that are not continuously differentiable, a\nclass of distributions that is increasingly used in image processing and\nmachine learning and that is beyond the scope of existing MALA and HMC\nalgorithms. To use this method it is necessary to compute or to approximate\nefficiently the proximity mappings of the logarithm of the target density. For\nseveral popular models, including many Bayesian models used in modern signal\nand image processing and machine learning, this can be achieved with convex\noptimisation algorithms and with approximations based on proximal splitting\ntechniques, which can be implemented in parallel.

In this\ncontribution a probabilistic model for an idealized dark matter localization\nproblem is described. We first derive the probabilistic model for the inference\nof dark matter locations and masses, and then show how this model can be\nimplemented using BUGS and Infer.NET, two software systems for probabilistic\nprogramming. Finally, the different capabilities of both systems are discussed.\nThe presented dark matter model includes mainly non-conjugate factors, thus, it\nis difficult to implement this model with Infer.NET.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Jun 2013 12:32:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-04"}

Stochastic Galerkin methods based on polynomial chaos\nexpansions have shown superiority to other non-sampling and many sampling\ntechniques. However, for complicated governing equations numerical\nimplementations of stochastic Galerkin methods can become non-trivial. On the\nother hand, Monte Carlo and other traditional sampling methods, are\nstraightforward to implement. However, they do not offer as fast convergence\nrates as stochastic Galerkin. Other numerical approaches are the stochastic\ncollocation (SC) methods, which inherit both, the ease of implementation of\nMonte Carlo and the robustness of stochastic Galerkin to a great deal. In this\nwork we propose a novel enhancement to stochastic collocation methods using\ndeterministic model reduction techniques. Linear parabolic partial differential\nequations with random forcing terms are analysed. The input data are assumed to\nbe represented by a finite number of random variables. A rigorous convergence\nanalysis, supported by numerical results, shows that the proposed technique is\nnot only reliable and robust but also efficient.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Jun 2013 17:54:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-05"}

In this paper, we enhance the capability of a MoD\nsystem by deploying robotic shared vehicles that can autonomously cruise the\nstreets to be hailed by users. A key challenge to managing the MoD system\neffectively is that of real-time, fine-grained mobility demand sensing and\nprediction. This paper presents a novel decentralized data fusion and active\nsensing algorithm for real-time, fine-grained mobility demand sensing and\nprediction with a fleet of autonomous robotic vehicles in a MoD system. Our\nGaussian process (GP)-based decentralized data fusion algorithm can achieve a\nfine balance between predictive power and time efficiency. We theoretically\nguarantee its predictive performance to be equivalent to that of a\nsophisticated centralized sparse approximation for the GP model: The\ncomputation of such a sparse approximate GP model can thus be distributed among\nthe MoD vehicles, hence achieving efficient and scalable demand prediction.\nThough our decentralized active sensing strategy is devised to gather the most\ninformative demand data for demand prediction, it can achieve a dual effect of\nfleet rebalancing to service the mobility demands. Empirical evaluation on\nreal-world mobility demand data shows that our proposed algorithm can achieve a\nbetter balance between predictive accuracy and time efficiency than\nstate-of-the-art algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Jun 2013 14:05:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-07"}
