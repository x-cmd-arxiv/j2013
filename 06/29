Here, we combine a star formation model for the evolution of the\ngalaxy luminosity function from z=0 to z=10 with a metallicity-dependent\nefficiency for GRB formation to simultaneously predict the comoving GRB rate.\nOur model sheds light on the physical origin of the empirical relation often\nassumed between GRB rate and luminosity density-derived star formation rate:\nRgrb(z) = \\epsilon(z)*SFR_{obs}(z), with \\epsilon(z) (1+z)^{1.2}.

At z>4, most of\nthe star formation happens in low-metallicity hosts with nearly saturated\nefficiency of GRB production per unit stellar mass.

During the last decade, intense research was devoted to their\ndevelopment, mostly with the aim of fulfilling the requirements of their first\ntwo applications, namely quantum repeaters and linear-optical quantum\ncomputation. A better understanding of those requirements then motivated\nseveral different experimental approaches. Along the way, other exciting\napplications emerged, such as as quantum metrology, single-photon detection,\ntests of the foundations of quantum physics, device-independent quantum\ninformation processing and nonlinear processing of quantum information. Here we\nreview several prospective applications of optical quantum memories with a\nfocus on recent experimental achievements pertaining to these applications.\nThis review highlights that optical quantum memories have become essential for\nthe development of optical quantum information processing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Jun 2013 17:44:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

The measured distributions of the major\noperational parameters of the drift tube (DT), cathode strip chamber (CSC), and\nresistive plate chamber (RPC) systems met the design specifications. The\nspatial resolution per chamber was 80-120 micrometers in the DTs, 40-150\nmicrometers in the CSCs, and 0.8-1.2 centimeters in the RPCs. The time\nresolution achievable was 3 ns or better per chamber for all 3 systems.

Here we propose centrality measures that\ncan be used to analyze the relevance of the actors in process related to spread\nof influence. In [39] it was considered a multiagent system in which the agents\nare eager to perform a collective task depending on the perception of the\nwillingness to perform the task of other individuals. The setting is modeled\nusing a notion of simple games called influence games. Those games are defined\non graphs were the nodes are labeled by their influence threshold and the\nspread of influence between its nodes is used to determine whether a coalition\nis winning or not. Influence games provide tools to measure the importance of\nthe actors of a social network by means of classic power indices and provide a\nframework to consider new centrality criteria. In this paper we consider two of\nthe most classical power indices, i.e., Banzhaf and Shapley-Shubik indices, as\ncentrality measures for social networks in influence games. Although there is\nsome work related to specific scenarios of game-theoretic networks, here we use\nsuch indices as centrality measures in any social network where the spread of\ninfluence phenomenon can be applied. Further, we define new centrality measures\nsuch as satisfaction and effort that, as far as we know, have not been\nconsidered so far. We also perform a comparison of the proposed measures with\nother three classic centrality measures, degree, closeness and betweenness,\nconsidering three social networks. We show that in some cases our measurements\nprovide centrality hierarchies similar to those of other measures, while in\nother cases provide different hierarchies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Jun 2013 18:58:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-01"}

Our aim is\nto explore some aspects of cluster galaxy evolution and the dynamical state of\nclusters as two sides of the same process. We used 10,721 member galaxies of\n183 clusters extracted from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey using a list of NoSOCS\nand CIRS targets. First, we classified the clusters into two categories,\nGaussian and non-Gaussian, according to their velocity distribution\nmeasurements, which we used as an indicator of their dynamical state. We then\nused objective criteria to split up galaxies according to their luminosities,\ncolors, and photometric mean stellar age. This information was then used to\nevaluate how galaxies evolve in their host clusters. Meaningful color\ngradients, i.e., the fraction of red galaxies as a function of radius from the\ncenter, are observed for both the Gaussian velocity distribution and the\nnon-Gaussian velocity distribution cluster subsamples, which suggests that\nmember galaxy colors change on a shorter timescale than the time needed for the\ncluster to reach dynamical equilibrium. We also found that larger portions of\nfainter red galaxies are found, on average, in smaller radii. The luminosity\nfunction in Gaussian clusters has a brighter characteristic absolute magnitude\nand a steeper faint-end slope than it does in the non-Gaussian velocity\ndistribution clusters. Our findings suggest that cluster galaxies experience\nintense color evolution before virialization, while the formation of faint\ngalaxies through dynamical interactions probably takes place on a longer\ntimescale, possibly longer than the virialization time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Jun 2013 19:30:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

In this paper, we focus on the mass-size\nrelation of quiescent massive ETGs (Mstar/Msol > 3*10^10) living in massive\nclusters (M200 ~ 10^14 Mstar) at 0.8< z <1.5, as compared to those living in\nthe field at the same epoch. Our sample contains ~ 400 ETGs in clusters and the\nsame number in the field. Therefore, our sample is approximately an order of\nmagnitude larger than previous studies in the same redshift range for galaxy\nclusters. We find that ETGs living in clusters are between ~30-50% larger than\ngalaxies with the same stellar mass residing in the field. We parametrize the\nsize using the mass-normalized size, gamma=Re/Mstar^0.57. The gamma\ndistributions in both environments peak at the same position but the\ndistributions in clusters are more skewed towards larger sizes. Since this size\ndifference is not observed in the local Universe, the size evolution at fixed\nstellar mass from z~1.5 of cluster galaxies is less steep ((1+z)-0.53pm0.04)\nthan the evolution of field galaxies ((1+z)-0.92pm0.04).\n  The size difference seems to be essentially driven by the galaxies residing\nin the clusters cores (R<0.5*R200). If part of the size evolution is due to\nmergers, the difference we see between cluster and field galaxies could be due\nto higher merger rates in clusters at higher redshift, probably during the\nformation phase of the clusters when velocity dispersions are lower. We cannot\nexclude however that the difference is driven by newly quenched galaxies which\nare quenched more efficiently in clusters. The implications of these results\nfor the hierarchical growth of ETGs will be discussed in a companion paper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Jun 2013 20:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

In\nsmooth geometry, hyperbolicity captures the notion of negative curvature;\nwithin the more abstract context of metric spaces, it can be generalized as\nd-hyperbolicity. This generalized definition can be applied to graphs, which we\nexplore in this report. We provide strong evidence that communication and\nsocial networks exhibit this fundamental property, and through extensive\ncomputations we quantify the degree of hyperbolicity of each network in\ncomparison to its diameter. By contrast, and as evidence of the validity of the\nmethodology, applying the same methods to the road networks shows that they are\nnot hyperbolic, which is as expected. Finally, we present practical\ncomputational means for detection of hyperbolicity and show how the test itself\nmay be scaled to much larger graphs than those we examined via renormalization\ngroup methodology. Using well-understood mechanisms, we provide evidence\nthrough synthetically generated graphs that hyperbolicity is preserved and\nindeed amplified by renormalization. This allows us to detect hyperbolicity in\nlarge networks efficiently, through much smaller renormalized versions. These\nobservations indicate that d-hyperbolicity is a common feature of large-scale\nnetworks. We propose that d-hyperbolicity in conjunction with other local\ncharacteristics of networks, such as the degree distribution and clustering\ncoefficients, provide a more complete unifying picture of networks, and helps\nclassify in a parsimonious way what is otherwise a bewildering and complex\narray of features and characteristics specific to each natural and man-made\nnetwork.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Jun 2013 21:32:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-02"}

This\nwrite-up, rather than being a collection of well known results, is intended to\nhighlight open issues and the most intriguing results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Jun 2013 22:03:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 Jul 2013 14:59:29 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 30 Jul 2013 23:56:13 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 30 Aug 2013 22:41:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

Graph analogues of these processes have\nrecently seen a rise in popularity as relaxations of NP-complete combinatorial\nproblems, which demands deeper theoretical underpinnings of the graph\nprocesses. The aim of this paper is to introduce these graph processes in the\nlight of their continuum counterparts, provide some background, prove the first\nresults connecting them, illustrate these processes with examples and identify\nopen questions for future study. We derive a graph curvature from the graph cut\nfunction, the natural graph counterpart of total variation (perimeter). This\nderivation and the resulting curvature definition differ from those in earlier\nliterature, where the continuum mean curvature is simply discretized, and bears\nmany similarities to the continuum nonlocal curvature or nonlocal means\nformulation. This new graph curvature is not only relevant for graph MBO\ndynamics, but also appears in the variational formulation of a discrete time\ngraph mean curvature flow. We prove estimates showing that the dynamics are\ntrivial for both MBO and AC evolutions if the parameters (the time-step and\ndiffuse interface scale, respectively) are sufficiently small (a phenomenon\nknown as \"freezing\" or \"pinning\") and also that the dynamics for MBO are\nnontrivial if the time step is large enough. These bounds are in terms of graph\nquantities such as the spectrum of the graph Laplacian and the graph curvature.\nAdapting a Lyapunov functional for the continuum MBO scheme to graphs, we prove\nthat the graph MBO scheme converges to a stationary state in a finite number of\niterations. Variations on this scheme have recently become popular in the\nliterature as ways to minimize (continuum) nonlocal total variation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Jun 2013 22:49:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 20 Feb 2014 21:27:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 13 Feb 2015 15:49:44 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 30 Apr 2015 10:28:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-11"}

This\ntechnique involves the indexing of the database models based on the sign of the\nprojections (PCA coefficients) of the first few relevant orders of principal\ncomponents of the four Stokes parameters. In this way, each model in the\ndatabase can be attributed a distinctive binary number of $2^{4n}$ bits, where\n$n$ is the number of PCA orders used for the indexing. Each of these binary\nnumbers (indexes) identifies a group of \"compatible\" models for the inversion\nof a given set of observed Stokes profiles sharing the same index.

We focus on set-ups that enjoy a Galilean symmetry in the\nscalar sector and an Abelian gauge symmetry in the vector sector. These\nsymmetries, together with the requirement that the equations of motion contain\nat most two space-time derivatives, only allow for a small number of operators\nin the Lagrangian for the gravitational fields. We investigate the role of\ngravitational vector fields for two broad classes of phenomena that\ncharacterize modified gravity scenarios. The first is self-acceleration: we\nanalyze in general terms the behavior of vector fluctuations around\nself-accelerating solutions, and show that vanishing kinetic terms of vector\nfluctuations lead to instabilities on cosmological backgrounds. The second\nphenomenon is the screening of long range fifth forces by means of Vainshtein\nmechanism. We show that if gravitational vector fields are appropriately\ncoupled to a spherically symmetric source, they can play an important role for\ndefining the features of the background solution and the scale of the\nVainshtein radius.

Energy is then transferred to smaller\nscales by an intermittent process that has been the focus of a vast literature.\nHowever, the energy input at large scales is not constant in most real\nturbulent flows. We explore the signatures of these fluctuations of large scale\nenergy input on small scale turbulence statistics. Measurements were made in a\nflow between oscillating grids, with Re up to 271, in which temporal variations\nin the large scale energy input can be introduced by modulating the oscillating\ngrid frequency. We find that the Kolmogorov constant for second order\nlongitudinal structure functions depends on the magnitude of the fluctuations\nin the large scale energy input. We can quantitatively predict the measured\nchange with a model based on Kolmogorov's refined similarity theory. The\neffects of fluctuations of the energy input can also be observed using\nstructure functions conditioned on the instantaneous large scale velocity. A\nlinear parameterization using the curvature of the iconditional structure\nfunctions provides a fairly good match with the measured changes in the\nKolmogorov constant. Conditional structure functions are found to provide a\nmore sensitive measure of the presence of fluctuations in the large scale\nenergy input than inertial range scaling coefficients.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Jun 2013 10:39:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

This semantics extends, in a way, the more\ntraditional meanings given by Heyting categories, the topos-theoretic\ninterpretation, and Kripke models. The feature which justifies the introduction\nof this novel semantics is the fact that it is 'point-free', i.e., there is no\nuniverse whose elements are used to interpret the logical terms. In other\nwords, terms do not denote individuals of some collection but, instead, they\ndenote the 'glue' which keeps together the interpretations of statements,\nsimilarly to what happens in formal topology.

Then, we applied a multiple logistic regression\nanalysis to determine if bibliometric indicators can explain by themselves the\nconcession of grant proposals. 63.4% of the applications were funded.\nBibliometric indicators for accepted proposals showed a better previous\nperformance than for those rejected; however the correlation between peer\nreview and bibliometric indicators is very heterogeneous among most areas.

Due to the complex nature, direct numerical simulations on\nthe fine grid are prohibitively expensive. It is therefore important to develop\nefficient and accurate methods that allow the use of coarse grids. In this\npaper, we present a multiscale finite element method for wave propagation on a\ncoarse grid. The proposed method is based on the Generalized Multiscale Finite\nElement Method (GMsFEM). To construct multiscale basis functions, we start with\ntwo snapshot spaces in each coarse-grid block where one represents the degrees\nof freedom on the boundary and the other represents the degrees of freedom in\nthe interior. We use local spectral problems to identify important modes in\neach snapshot space. These local spectral problems are different from each\nother and their formulations are based on the analysis. To our best knowledge,\nthis is the first time where multiple snapshot spaces and multiple spectral\nproblems are used and necessary for efficient computations. Using the dominant\nmodes from local spectral problems, multiscale basis functions are constructed\nto represent the solution space locally within each coarse block. These\nmultiscale basis functions are coupled via the symmetric interior penalty\ndiscontinuous Galerkin method which provides a block diagonal mass matrix, and,\nconsequently, results in fast computations in an explicit time discretiza-\ntion. Our methods' stability and spectral convergence are rigorously analyzed.\nNumerical examples are presented to show our methods' performance. We also test\noversampling strategies. In particular, we discuss how the modes from different\nsnapshot spaces can affect the proposed methods' accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Jun 2013 15:53:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-26"}
