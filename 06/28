For this\nproblem, different methods have been proposed and justified by establishing\nexact convergence rates for the classification risk, as well as the l2\nconvergence results to the discriminative rule. However, sharp theoretical\nanalysis for the variable selection performance of these procedures have not\nbeen established, even though model interpretation is of fundamental importance\nin scientific data analysis. This paper bridges the gap by providing sharp\nsufficient conditions for consistent variable selection using the sparse\ndiscriminant analysis (Mai et al., 2012). Through careful analysis, we\nestablish rates of convergence that are significantly faster than the best\nknown results and admit an optimal scaling of the sample size n, dimensionality\np, and sparsity level s in the high-dimensional setting. Sufficient conditions\nare complemented by the necessary information theoretic limits on the variable\nselection problem in the context of high-dimensional discriminant analysis.\nExploiting a numerical equivalence result, our method also establish the\noptimal results for the ROAD estimator (Fan et al., 2012) and the sparse\noptimal scaling estimator (Clemmensen et al., 2011). Furthermore, we analyze an\nexhaustive search procedure, whose performance serves as a benchmark, and show\nthat it is variable selection consistent under weaker conditions. Extensive\nsimulations demonstrating the sharpness of the bounds are also provided.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Jun 2013 16:05:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-28"}

Here we present the results of a comprehensive set of\nSmoothed Particle Hydrodynamics simulations of close encounters of white dwarfs\naimed to explore the outcome of the interaction and the nature of the final\nremnants for different initial conditions. Depending on the initial conditions\nand the white dwarf masses, three different outcomes are possible.\nSpecifically, the outcome of the interaction can be either a direct or a\nlateral collision or the interaction can result in the formation of an\neccentric binary system. In those cases in which a collision occurs, the\ninfalling material is compressed and heated such that the physical conditions\nfor a detonation may be reached during the most violent phases of the merger.\nWhile we find that detonations occur in a significant number of our\nsimulations, in some of them the temperature increase in the shocked region\nrapidly lifts degeneracy, leading to the quenching of the burning. We thus\ncharacterize under which circumstances a detonation is likely to occur as a\nresult of the impact of the disrupted star on the surface of the more massive\nwhite dwarf. Finally, we also study which interactions result in bound systems,\nand in which ones the more massive white dwarf is also disrupted as a\nconsequence of the dynamical interaction. The sizable number of simulations\nperformed in this work allows to find how the outcome of the interaction\ndepends on the distance at closest approach, and on the masses of the colliding\nwhite dwarfs, and which is the chemical pattern of the nuclearly processed\nmaterial. Finally, we also discuss the influence of the masses and core\nchemical compositions of the interacting white dwarfs and the different kinds\nof impact in the properties of the remnants.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Jun 2013 16:10:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

Capitalizing on that approach, we derive a new\nexpression for the probability density function (p.d.f.) of the joint\neigenvalues of a complex non-central Wishart matrix with a rank-1 mean. The\nresulting functional form in turn enables us to use powerful classical\northogonal polynomial techniques in solving three problems related to the\nnon-central Wishart matrix. To be specific, for an $n\\times n$ complex\nnon-central Wishart matrix $\\mathbf{W}$ with $m$ degrees of freedom ($m\\geq n$)\nand a rank-1 mean, we derive a new expression for the cumulative distribution\nfunction (c.d.f.) of the minimum eigenvalue ($\\lambda_{\\min}$). The c.d.f. is\nexpressed as the determinant of a square matrix, the size of which depends only\non the difference $m-n$. This further facilitates the analysis of the\nmicroscopic limit for the minimum eigenvalue which takes the form of the\ndeterminant of a square matrix of size $m-n$ with the Bessel kernel.

It emerges that Keen's model has just\ntwo possible long term solutions: stable growth or terminal collapse. While\ncollapse can come about immediately from economies that are nonviable by virtue\nof unsuitable parameters or initial conditions, in general the collapse is\npreceded by an interval of exponential growth. In first approximation, the\nduration of that exponential growth is half a period of a sinusoidal\noscillation. The period is determined by reciprocal of the imaginary part of\none root of a certain quintic polynomial. The real part of the same root\ndetermines the rate of growth of the economy.

In this sense, these\nindicators are currently the focus of the bibliometric community and are being\ndiscussed and debated. We describe the main platforms and indicators and we\nanalyze as a sample the Spanish research output in Communication Studies.\nComparing traditional indicators such as citations with these new indicators.\nThe results show that the most cited papers are also the ones with a highest\nimpact according to the altmetrics. We conclude pointing out the main\nshortcomings these metrics present and the role they may play when measuring\nthe research impact through 2.0 platforms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Jun 2013 18:20:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-28"}

The mass loss\nmodel for dust-free disks developed by Hollenbach et al. is currently regarded\nas a conventional one and has been used in a wide variety of studies. However,\nthe rate in this model was derived by the crude so-called 1+1D approximation of\nionizing radiation transfer, which assumes that diffuse radiation propagates in\na direction vertical to the disk. In this study, we revisit the\nphotoevaporation of dust-free disks by solving the 2D axisymmetric radiative\ntransfer for steady-state disks. Unlike that solved by the conventional model,\nwe determine that direct stellar radiation is more important than the diffuse\nfield at the disk surface. The radial density distribution at the ionization\nboundary is represented by the single power-law with an index -3/2 in contrast\nto the conventional double power-law. For this distribution, the\nphotoevaporation rate from the entire disk can be written as a function of the\nionizing photon emissivity, Phi_EUV, from the central star and the disk outer\nradius, r_d, as follows: Mdot_PE = 5.4 x 10^-5 x (Phi_EUV/10^49 sec^-1)^1/2 x\n(r_d/1000 AU)^1/2 Msun/yr. This new rate depends on the outer disk radius\nrather than on the gravitational radius as in the conventional model, caused by\nthe enhanced contribution to the mass loss from the outer disk annuli.

The third and final element (a\npost-processing script called DiskoBall) calculates the disk-averaged spectrum\nby weighting the individual emergent spectra by limb darkening and projected\narea, and applying the effects of Doppler broadening. All together, the\nMOOGStokes package allows users to synthesize emergent spectra of stars with\nmagnetic fields in a familiar computational framework. MOOGStokes produces\ndisk-averaged spectra for all Stokes vectors (I, Q, U, and V), normalized by\nthe continuum. MOOGStokes agrees well with the predictions of INVERS10 a\npolarized radiative transfer code with a long history of use in the study of\nstellar magnetic fields.

Whilst modern cosmological probes indicate that pure\nbaryonic dynamics is not sufficient on the largest scales, nearby galaxies and\nsmall galaxy groups persistently obey Milgrom's MOND law, which implies that\ndynamics at small scales is possibly entirely predicted by the baryons. Here,\nwe investigate the Local Group timing in this context of Milgromian dynamics.\nMaking use of the latest measured proper motions and radial velocities for\nAndromeda and the Magellanic clouds, we integrate backwards their orbits by\nmaking use of the Milgromian two-body equation of motion. We find that, with\nthe currently measured proper motions and radial velocity of M31, MOND would\nimply that the Milky Way and M31 first moved apart via Hubble expansion after\nbirth, but then necessarily got attracted again by the Milgromian gravitational\nattraction, and had a past fly-by encounter before coming to their present\npositions. This encounter would most probably have happened 7 to 11 Gyr ago\n(0.8<z<3). The absence of a dark matter halo and its associated dynamical\nfriction is necessary for such a close encounter not to trigger a merger.\nObservational arguments which could exclude or favour such a past encounter\nwould thus be very important in view of falsifying or vindicating Milgromian\ndynamics on the scale of the Local Group.

We also demonstrate that\nthe metallicity in star forming regions is kept low due to the mixing of the\nmetal-rich bubbles and the metal-poor inter-stellar medium. Our simulations\nalso suggest that the bubble-induced star formation leads to many\ncounter-rotating stars. The bubble-induced star formation could be a dominant\nmechanism to maintain star formation in dIrrs, which is different from larger\nspiral galaxies where the non-axisymmetric structures, such as spiral arms, are\na main driver of star formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Jun 2013 20:00:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 Nov 2013 17:25:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

This can possibly be attributed to\nthe difficulty of finding galaxies with accurate redshifts in the vicinity of\nz~6 quasars. So far, overdensity searches around z~6 quasars have been based on\nstudies of Lyman break galaxies (LBGs), which probe a redshift range of Delta z\n~ 1.

However, there are relatively few studies comparing the implications of\nusing different modeling approaches in the context of comprehensive risk\nanalysis of critical infrastructures.

Our main result is a negative answer to this question.\nWe show that for all $\\tau' < \\tau$, each temperature-$\\tau'$ 2HAM tile system\ndoes not simulate at least one temperature-$\\tau$ 2HAM tile system. This\nimpossibility result proves that the 2HAM is not intrinsically universal, in\nstark contrast to the simpler (single-tile addition only) abstract Tile\nAssembly Model which is intrinsically universal (\"The tile assembly model is\nintrinsically universal\", FOCS 2012). However, on the positive side, we prove\nthat, for every fixed temperature $\\tau \\geq 2$, temperature-$\\tau$ 2HAM tile\nsystems are indeed intrinsically universal: in other words, for each $\\tau$\nthere is a single universal 2HAM tile set $U$ that, when appropriately\ninitialized, is capable of simulating the behavior of any temperature-$\\tau$\n2HAM tile system. As a corollary of these results we find an infinite set of\ninfinite hierarchies of 2HAM systems with strictly increasing simulation power\nwithin each hierarchy. Finally, we show that for each $\\tau$, there is a\ntemperature-$\\tau$ 2HAM system that simultaneously simulates all\ntemperature-$\\tau$ 2HAM systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Jun 2013 04:06:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Aug 2014 20:46:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-22"}

The singlet scalar mass is not constrained by the unitarity itself\nwhen we impose Z_2 in the model because of no mixing with the Higgs scalar.\nBut, regarding the singlet scalar field as a cold dark matter candidate, we\nderive upper bound on the singlet scalar mass by combining the observed relic\nabundance with the unitarity condition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Jun 2013 04:19:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-01"}

The single-dish moment zero maps of\nthe starless cores show single structures with central column densities ranging\nfrom 7 to 42 times 10^23 cm^-2 and LTE masses from 20 solar masses to 154 solar\nmasses. However, at the higher CARMA resolution (5 arcsec), all of the cores\nexcept one fragment into 3 - 5 components. The number of fragments is small\ncompared to that found in some turbulent fragmentation models, although\ninclusion of magnetic fields may reduce the predicted fragment number and\nimprove the model agreement. This result demonstrates that fragmentation from\nparsec-scale molecular clouds to sub-parsec cores continues to take place\ninside the starless cores. The starless cores and their fragments are embedded\nin larger filamentary structures, which likely played a role in the core\nformation and fragmentation. Most cores show clear velocity gradients, with\nmagnitudes ranging from 1.7 to 14.3 km/s/pc. We modeled one of them in detail,\nand found that its spectra are best explained by a converging flow along a\nfilament toward the core center; the gradients in other cores may be modeled\nsimilarly. We infer a mass inflow rate of ~ 2 x 10^{-3} Msolar/yr, which is in\nprinciple high enough to overcome radiation pressure and allow for massive star\nformation. However, the core contains multiple fragments, and it is unclear\nwhether the rapid inflow would feed the growth of primarily a single massive\nstar or a cluster of lower mass objects.

In this work we use the formalism of\ngeometrothermodynamics to infer cosmological models which predict the observed\nspeed up.

The\ncomputation extended to all mass tracers of the sample provides a detailed map\nof the negative potential fluctuations.

This Giant Faraday rotation originates from the\ncyclotron resonance of massless electrons, which allows dynamical tuning\nthrough either external electrostatic or magnetostatic setting. Furthermore,\nthe rotation direction can be controlled by changing the sign of the carriers\nin graphene, which can be done by means of an external electric field. However,\ndespite these tuning possibilities, the requirement of large magnetic fields\nhinders application of the Faraday effect in real devices, especially for\nfrequencies higher than few THz. In this work we demonstrate that, for a given\nvalue of the static external magnetic field, giant Faraday rotation can be\nachieved in arrays of graphene microribbons at frequencies much higher than the\ncorresponding cyclotron frequency. The main feature in the magneto-optical\nresponse of graphene ribbons is not associated with the cyclotron resonance but\nrather with the fundamental magnetoplasmon excitation of a single ribbon. The\nmagnetoplasmon nature of Faraday rotation in graphene ribbons opens great\npossibilities, as the resonance frequency can be locally selected by\nappropriately choosing the width of the ribbon while still preserving the\ntuning capability through a (smaller) external magnetic field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Jun 2013 11:56:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-01"}

There are, however, negative\nsocial perceptions about data mining, among which potential privacy violation\nand potential discrimination. Automated data collection and data mining\ntechniques such as classification have paved the way to making automated\ndecisions, like loan granting/denial, insurance premium computation. If the\ntraining datasets are biased in what regards discriminatory attributes like\ngender, race, religion, discriminatory decisions may ensue. In the first part\nof this thesis, we tackle discrimination prevention in data mining and propose\nnew techniques applicable for direct or indirect discrimination prevention\nindividually or both at the same time. We discuss how to clean training\ndatasets and outsourced datasets in such a way that direct and/or indirect\ndiscriminatory decision rules are converted to legitimate (non-discriminatory)\nclassification rules. In the second part of this thesis, we argue that privacy\nand discrimination risks should be tackled together. We explore the\nrelationship between privacy preserving data mining and discrimination\nprevention in data mining to design holistic approaches capable of addressing\nboth threats simultaneously during the knowledge discovery process. As part of\nthis effort, we have investigated for the first time the problem of\ndiscrimination and privacy aware frequent pattern discovery, i.e. the\nsanitization of the collection of patterns mined from a transaction database in\nsuch a way that neither privacy-violating nor discriminatory inferences can be\ninferred on the released patterns. Moreover, we investigate the problem of\ndiscrimination and privacy aware data publishing, i.e. transforming the data,\ninstead of patterns, in order to simultaneously fulfill privacy preservation\nand discrimination prevention.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Jun 2013 12:00:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-01"}

We discuss corresponding production rates and some\ndifferential distributions for $(D^0 D^0$ + $\\bar D^0 \\bar D^0)$ production.\nWithin large theoretical uncertainties the predicted DPS cross section is\nfairly similar to the cross section measured recently by the LHCb\ncollaboration. The best description is obtained with the Kimber-Martin-Ryskin\n(KMR) unintegrated gluon distribution. The contribution of SPS, calculated in\nthe high-energy approximation, turned out to be rather small. Finally, we\nemphasize significant contribution of DPS mechanism to inclusive charmed meson\nspectra measured recently by ALICE, ATLAS and LHCb.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Jun 2013 13:40:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-01"}

One such amelioration mechanism relies on\nperturbing the magnetic field in the edge plasma region, either leading to more\nfrequent, smaller ELMs (ELM mitigation) or ELM suppression. This technique of\nResonant Magnetic Perturbations (RMPs) has been employed to suppress type I\nELMs at high collisionality/density on DIII-D, ASDEX Upgrade, KSTAR and JET and\nat low collisionality on DIII-D. At ITER-like collisionality the RMPs enhance\nthe transport of particles or energy and keep the edge pressure gradient below\nthe 2D linear ideal MHD critical value that would trigger an ELM, whereas at\nhigh collisionality/density the type I ELMs are replaced by small type II ELMs.\nAlthough ELM suppression only occurs within limitied operational ranges, ELM\nmitigation is much more easily achieved. The exact parameters that determine\nthe onset of ELM suppression are unknown but in all cases the magnetic\nperturbations produce 3D distortions to the plasma and enhanced particle\ntransport. The incorporation of these 3D effects in codes will be essential in\norder to make quantitative predictions for future devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Jun 2013 13:48:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-28"}

We present cosmological forecasts when\nclustering data alone is used, and when clustering is combined with a cosmic\nshear analysis. We consider two types of clustering analysis: firstly,\nclustering with only redshift auto-correlations in tomographic redshift bins;\nsecondly, using all available redshift bin correlations. Finally, we consider\nhow inferred cosmological parameters may be biased using each analysis when\nflux magnification is neglected. Results are presented for a Stage III\nground-based survey, and a Stage IV space-based survey modelled with\nphotometric redshift errors, and values for the slope of the luminosity\nfunction inferred from CFHTLenS catalogues. We find that combining clustering\ninformation with shear can improve constraints on cosmological parameters,\ngiving an improvement to a Dark Energy Task Force-like figure of merit by a\nfactor of 1.33 when only auto-correlations in redshift are used for the\nclustering analysis, rising to 1.52 when cross-correlations in redshift are\nalso included. The addition of galaxy-galaxy lensing gives further improvement,\nwith increases in figure of merit by a factor of 2.82 and 3.7 for each type of\nclustering analysis respectively. The presence of flux magnification in a\nclustering analysis does not significantly affect the precision of cosmological\nconstraints when combined with cosmic shear and galaxy-galaxy lensing.

The method of construction\nhelps analyze and control complex oscillating systems through novel geometric\nmeans. Special attention is stressed upon a problem not formerly solved: to\nimpose consistent boundary conditions on the Lyapunov function in each linear\nregion. By successfully solving the problem, the authors construct continuous\nLyapunov functions in the whole state space. It is further demonstrated that\nthe Lyapunov functions constructed explain for the different bifurcations\nleading to the emergence of limit cycle oscillation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Jun 2013 15:40:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-01"}

We consider only non-rotating\nstars in this work, so our solutions are most immediately applicable to\nslowly-rotating systems such as magnetars. Nonetheless, we demonstrate that\nmagnetospheres qualitatively resembling those expected for both magnetars and\npulsars are possible within our framework.

Possible angular correlation between the orientations of\nthese low multipoles have also been claimed. It is important to investigate the\npossibility that the power deficiency at low multipoles may not be of\nprimordial origin and is only an observation artifact coming from the scan\nprocedure adapted in the WMAP or Planck satellites. Therefore, its always\nimportant to investigate all the observational artifacts that can mimic them.\nThe CMB dipole which is almost 550 times higher than the quadrupole can leak to\nthe higher multipoles due to the non-symmetric beam shape of the WMAP. In this\npaper a formalism has been developed and simulations are carried out to study\nthe effect of the non-symmetric beam on this power transfer. It is interesting\nto observed that a small but non-negligible amount of power from the dipole can\nget transferred to the quadrupole and the higher multipoles due to the\nnon-symmetric beam. It is shown that in case of WMAP scan strategy the shape of\nthe quadrupole coming due to this power leakage is very much similar to the\nobserved quadrupole from WMAP data. Simulations have also been carried out for\nPlanck scan strategy. It is seen that for Planck scan strategy the power\ntransfer is not only limited to the quadrupole but also to a few higher low\nmultipoles. Since the actual beam shapes of Planck are not publicly available\nwe present results in terms of upper limits on asymmetric beam parameters that\nwould contaminate of the quadrupole power at the level of $1\\mu K$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Jun 2013 07:06:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}
