Moments of arbitrary order, as well as non-polynomial moments\ncan be included in the formulation. We show that this gives rise to a hierarchy\nof optimization problems with decreasing levels of risk-aversion, with classic\nrobust optimization at one end of the spectrum, and stochastic programming at\nthe other. Although our primary motivation is to solve distributionally robust\noptimization problems with moment uncertainty, the cutting surface method for\ngeneral semi-infinite convex programs is also of independent interest. The\nproposed method is applicable to problems with non-differentiable semi-infinite\nconstraints indexed by an infinite-dimensional index set. Examples comparing\nthe cutting surface algorithm to the central cutting plane algorithm of\nKortanek and No demonstrate the potential of our algorithm even in the solution\nof traditional semi-infinite convex programming problems whose constraints are\ndifferentiable and are indexed by an index set of low dimension. After the rate\nof convergence analysis of the cutting surface algorithm, we extend the\nauthors' moment matching scenario generation algorithm to a probabilistic\nalgorithm that finds optimal probability distributions subject to moment\nconstraints. The combination of this distribution optimization method and the\ncentral cutting surface algorithm yields a solution to a family of\ndistributionally robust optimization problems that are considerably more\ngeneral than the ones proposed to date.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Jun 2013 16:01:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Jun 2013 17:15:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 13 Aug 2014 15:08:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-14"}

Here we analyse a class of\npreferential attachment networks in the robust regime and prove four main\nresults supporting this claim: After removal of an arbitrarily small proportion\nepsilon>0 of the oldest nodes (1) the asymptotic degree distribution has\nexponential instead of power law tails; (2) the largest degree in the network\ndrops from being of the order of a power of the network size n to being just\nlogarithmic in n; (3) the typical distances in the network increase from order\nlog log n to order log n; and (4) the network becomes vulnerable to random\nremoval of nodes.

Within the Fireshell model, we interpret the faint precursor in\nthe light curve as the emission at the transparency of the expanding e+e-\nplasma: the Proper-GRB (P-GRB). From the observed isotropic energy we assume a\ntotal energy Ee+e-=(1.10+-0.06)*10^53 erg and derive a Baryon load\nB=(1.45+-0.28)*10^(-3) and a Lorentz factor at transparency\nGamma=(6.7+-1.6)*10^2. The main emission 0.4 s after the initial spike is\ninterpreted as the extended afterglow, due to the interaction of the\nultrarelativistic baryons with the CircumBurst Medium (CBM). Using the\ncondition of fully radiative regime, we infer a CBM average spherically\nsymmetric density of nCBM=(1.85+-0.14)10^3 cm^(-3), one of the highest found in\nthe Fireshell model.

But two major obstacles\nhave stood in the way of widespread applications: low secure key generation\nrates and short achievable operating distances. In this paper, a new physical\nmechanism for dealing with the first of these problems is proposed: interplay\nbetween different degrees of freedom in a hyperentangled system (parametric\ndown conversion) is used to increase the Hilbert space dimension available for\nkey generation while maintaining security. Polarization-based Bell tests\nprovide security checking, while orbital angular momentum (OAM) and total\nangular momentum (TAM) provide higher key generation rate. Whether to measure\nTAM or OAM is decided randomly on each trial. The concurrent non-commutativity\nof TAM with OAM and polarization provides the physical basis for quantum\nsecurity. TAM measurements link polarization to OAM, so that if the legitimate\nparticipants measure OAM while the eavesdropper measures TAM (or vice-versa),\nthen polarization entanglement is lost, revealing the eavesdropper. In contrast\nto other OAM-based QKD methods, complex active switching between OAM bases is\nnot required; instead, passive switching by beam splitters combined with much\nsimpler active switching between polarization bases makes implementation at\nhigh OAM more practical.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Jun 2013 19:11:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 Sep 2013 20:35:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 28 Feb 2014 20:45:38 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 25 Jun 2014 18:56:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

We present deep Chandra\nobservations of the cool core cluster Abell 2029, which has a sloshing spiral\nextending radially outward from the center of the cluster to approximately 400\nkpc at its fullest extent---the largest continuous spiral observed to date. We\nfind a surface brightness excess, a temperature decrement, a density\nenhancement, an elemental abundance enhancement, and a smooth pressure profile\nin the area of the spiral. The sloshing gas seems to be interacting with the\nsouthern lobe of the central radio galaxy, causing it to bend and giving the\nradio source a wide-angle tail (WAT) morphology. This shows that WATs can be\nproduced in clusters that are relatively relaxed on large scales. We explore\nthe interaction between heating and cooling in the central region of the\ncluster. Energy injection from the active galactic nucleus (AGN) is likely\ninsufficient to offset the cooling, and sloshing may be an important additional\nmechanism in preventing large amounts of gas from cooling to very low\ntemperatures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Jun 2013 21:45:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 Jul 2013 18:25:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

This discrepancy between Hb and CIV arises from the fact that both line\nprofiles are treated the same way in single-epoch scaling relationships based\non the assumption that the broad-line region is virialized, even though a\nnon-virialized emission component is often significant in the CIV line and\nabsent or weak in the Hb line. Using quasi-simultaneous optical and\nultra-violet spectra for a sample of 85 optically bright quasars with redshifts\nin the range z=0.03-1.4, we present a significant step along the path to\nrehabilitating the CIV line for black hole mass estimates. We show that the\nresiduals of velocity line width between CIV and Hb are significantly\ncorrelated with the peak flux ratio of SiIV+OIV] 1400 to CIV. Using this\nrelationship, we develop a prescription for estimating black hole masses from\nthe ultra-violet spectrum that agree better with Hb-based masses than the\ntraditional CIV masses. The scatter between Hb and CIV masses is initially 0.43\ndex in our sample and is reduced to 0.33 dex when using our prescription. The\npeak flux ratio of SiIV+OIV] 1400 to CIV is an ultraviolet indicator of the\nsuite of spectral properties commonly known as \"Eigenvector 1\", thus the\nreduction in scatter between CIV and Hb black hole masses is essentially due to\nremoving an Eigenvector 1 bias in CIV-based masses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Jun 2013 21:45:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

Not only are index policies suboptimal\nin these contexts, there has been little analysis of such policies in these\nproblem settings. We show that if we consider near-optimal policies, in the\nsense of approximation algorithms, then there exists (near) index policies.\nConceptually, if we can find policies that satisfy an approximate version of\nthe exchange property, namely, that the reward from the play of an arm depends\non when the arm is played to within a constant factor, then we have an avenue\ntowards solving these problems. However such an approximate version of the\nidling bandit property does not hold on a per-play basis and are shown to hold\nin a global sense. Clearly, such a property is not necessarily true of\narbitrary single arm policies and finding such single arm policies is\nnontrivial.

The algorithm is\nspecifically aimed at solving complex motion planning problems in\nhigh-dimensional configuration spaces. This algorithm is proven to be\nasymptotically optimal and is shown to converge to an optimal solution faster\nthan its state-of-the-art counterparts, chiefly PRM* and RRT*. The FMT*\nalgorithm performs a \"lazy\" dynamic programming recursion on a predetermined\nnumber of probabilistically-drawn samples to grow a tree of paths, which moves\nsteadily outward in cost-to-arrive space. As a departure from previous analysis\napproaches that are based on the notion of almost sure convergence, the FMT*\nalgorithm is analyzed under the notion of convergence in probability: the extra\nmathematical flexibility of this approach allows for convergence rate\nbounds--the first in the field of optimal sampling-based motion planning.\nSpecifically, for a certain selection of tuning parameters and configuration\nspaces, we obtain a convergence rate bound of order $O(n^{-1/d+\\rho})$, where\n$n$ is the number of sampled points, $d$ is the dimension of the configuration\nspace, and $\\rho$ is an arbitrarily small constant. We go on to demonstrate\nasymptotic optimality for a number of variations on FMT*, namely when the\nconfiguration space is sampled non-uniformly, when the cost is not arc length,\nand when connections are made based on the number of nearest neighbors instead\nof a fixed connection radius. Numerical experiments over a range of dimensions\nand obstacle configurations confirm our theoretical and heuristic arguments by\nshowing that FMT*, for a given execution time, returns substantially better\nsolutions than either PRM* or RRT*, especially in high-dimensional\nconfiguration spaces and in scenarios where collision-checking is expensive.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Jun 2013 00:10:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 20 Jul 2013 00:22:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 30 Apr 2014 15:44:50 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 6 Feb 2015 19:41:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-09"}

Early results showed\ngood statistical pseudorandomness, and the simplicity of their construction\nmade them a natural candidate for use in cryptographic applications. Since\nthose early days of cellular automata, research in the field of cryptography\nhas developed a set of tools which allow designers to prove a particular scheme\nto be as hard as solving an instance of a well- studied problem, suggesting a\nlevel of security for the scheme. However, little or no literature is available\non whether these cellular automata can be proved secure under even generous\nassumptions. In fact, much of the literature falls short of providing complete,\ntestable schemes to allow such an analysis.\n  In this thesis, we first examine the suitability of cellular automata as a\nprimitive for building cryptographic primitives. In this effort, we focus on\npseudorandom bit generation and noninvertibility, the behavioral heart of\ncryptography. In particular, we focus on cyclic linear and non-linear au-\ntomata in some of the common configurations to be found in the literature. We\nexamine known attacks against these constructions and, in some cases, improve\nthe results.\n  Finding little evidence of provable security, we then examine whether the\ndesirable properties of cellular automata (i.e. highly parallel, simple\nconstruction) can be maintained as the automata are enhanced to provide a\nfoundation for such proofs. This investigation leads us to a new construction\nof a finite state cellular automaton (FSCA) which is NP-Hard to invert.\nFinally, we introduce the Chasm pseudorandom generator family built on this\nconstruction and provide some initial experimental results using the NIST test\nsuite.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Jun 2013 03:33:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-18"}

The approach is to treat civilization as an open,\nnon-equilibrium thermodynamic system that dissipates energy and diffuses matter\nin order to sustain existing circulations and to further its material growth.\nAppealing to a prior result that established a fixed relationship between a\nvery general representation of global economic wealth and rates of global\nprimary energy consumption, physically derived expressions for economic\nquantities follow. The analysis suggests that wealth can be expressed in terms\nof the length density of civilization's networks and the availability of energy\nresources. Rates of return on wealth are accelerated by energy reserve\ndiscovery, improvements to human and infrastructure longevity, and a more\ncommon culture, or a lowering of the amount of energy required to diffuse raw\nmaterials into civilization's bulk. According to a logistic equation, rates of\nreturn are slowed by past growth, and if rates of return approach zero, such\n\"slowing down\" makes civilization fragile with respect to externally imposed\nnetwork decay.

Examples of such multiplex systems are\nsocial networks where people are involved in different types of relationships\nand interact through various forms of communication media. The ranking of nodes\nin multiplex networks is one of the most pressing and challenging tasks that\nresearch on complex networks is currently facing. When pairs of nodes can be\nconnected through multiple links and in multiple layers, the ranking of nodes\nshould necessarily reflect the importance of nodes in one layer as well as\ntheir importance in other interdependent layers. In this paper, we draw on the\nidea of biased random walks to define the Multiplex PageRank centrality measure\nin which the effects of the interplay between networks on the centrality of\nnodes are directly taken into account. In particular, depending on the\nintensity of the interaction between layers, we define the Additive,\nMultiplicative, Combined, and Neutral versions of Multiplex PageRank, and show\nhow each version reflects the extent to which the importance of a node in one\nlayer affects the importance the node can gain in another layer. We discuss\nthese measures and apply them to an online multiplex social network. Findings\nindicate that taking the multiplex nature of the network into account helps\nuncover the emergence of rankings of nodes that differ from the rankings\nobtained from one single layer. Results provide support in favor of the\nsalience of multiplex centrality measures, like Multiplex PageRank, for\nassessing the prominence of nodes embedded in multiple interacting networks,\nand for shedding a new light on structural properties that would otherwise\nremain undetected if each of the interacting networks were analyzed in\nisolation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Jun 2013 13:31:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 Jun 2013 11:06:33 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 23 Sep 2013 22:45:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-12"}

The spin Hall effects (SHEs), first proposed 40 years ago,\nare an unusual class of phenomena where flowing particles experience\northogonally directed spin-dependent Lorentz-like forces, analogous to the\nconventional Lorentz force for the Hall effect, but opposite in sign for two\nspin states. Such spin Hall effects have been observed for electrons flowing in\nspin-orbit coupled materials such as GaAs or InGaAs and for laser light\ntraversing dielectric junctions. Here we observe the spin Hall effect in a\nquantum-degenerate Bose gas, and use the resulting spin-dependent Lorentz\nforces to realize a cold-atom spin transistor. By engineering a spatially\ninhomogeneous spin-orbit coupling field for our quantum gas, we explicitly\nintroduce and measure the requisite spin-dependent Lorentz forces, in excellent\nagreement with our calculations. This atomtronic circuit element behaves as a\nnew type of velocity-insensitive adiabatic spin-selector, with potential\napplication in devices such as magnetic or inertial sensors. In addition, such\ntechniques --- for both creating and measuring the SHE --- are clear\nprerequisites for engineering topological insulators and detecting their\nassociated quantized spin Hall effects in quantum gases.
