First, the resampling scheme is now genuinely\nsequential, thereby allowing to transpose to the strongly mixing setting many\nof the existing multiplier tests on the unknown copula, including nonparametric\ntests for change-point detection. Second, the resampling scheme is now fully\nautomatic as a data-adaptive procedure is proposed which can be used to\nestimate the bandwidth parameter. A simulation study is used to investigate the\nfinite-sample performance of the resampling scheme and provides suggestions on\nhow to choose several additional parameters.

As a result, previous studies on the effects of CO2 ice clouds using\ntwo-stream approximations overrated the atmospheric warming caused by the\nscattering greenhouse effect. Consequently, the scattering greenhouse effect of\nCO2 ice particles seems to be less effective than previously estimated.

The aim is to constrain the\nphysical characteristics (excitation, kinematics, column density) of the warm\ngas toward 26 low-mass Class 0 and I YSOs using spectrally-resolved Herschel\nSpace Observatory data of high-J lines of CO. Data are complemented by\nground-based observations from APEX and the JCMT to compare those with the\ncolder gas traced by lower-J CO lines. This is the first large spectrally\nresolved high-J CO survey conducted for these types of sources. The median\nexcitation temperatures for 12CO, 13CO and C18O derived from single-temperature\nfits to the J_u=2-10 integrated intensities are ~70K, 48K and 37K,\nrespectively, with no significant difference between Class 0 and I sources and\nno trend with M_env or L_bol. Thus, in contrast with the continuum SEDs, the\nspectral line energy distributions (SLEDs) do not show an evolution during the\nembedded stage.

The H2O 110-101/CO 10-9 intensity ratio does not change\nsignificantly with velocity, in contrast with the H2O/CO 3-2 ratio, indicating\nthat CO 10-9 is the lowest transition for which the line wings probe the same\nwarm shocked gas as H2O. Modeling of the full suite of C18O lines indicates an\nabundance profile for Class 0 sources that is consistent with a freeze-out zone\nbelow 25 K and evaporation at higher temperatures, with but some fraction of\nthe CO transformed into other species in the cold phase. In contrast,\nobservations for two Class I sources in Ophiuchus are consistent with a\nconstant high CO abundance profile.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Jun 2013 19:32:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-19"}

This data, along with helioseismic measurements and open\ncluster spin down studies, provide powerful clues about the nature and\ntimescale for internal angular momentum transport in stars. We focus on two\ncases: the metal poor red giant KIC 7341231 (\"Otto\") and intermediate mass core\nhelium burning stars. For both we examine limiting case studies for angular\nmomentum coupling between cores and envelopes under the assumption of rigid\nrotation on the main sequence. We discuss the expected pattern of core rotation\nas a function of mass and radius. In the case of Otto, strong\npost-main-sequence coupling is ruled out and the measured core rotation rate is\nin the range of 23 to 33 times the surface value expected from standard spin\ndown models. The minimum coupling time scale (.17 to .45 Gyr) is significantly\nlonger than that inferred for young open cluster stars. This implies\nineffective internal angular momentum transport in early first ascent giants.\nBy contrast, the core rotation rates of evolved secondary clump stars are found\nto be consistent with strong coupling given their rapid main sequence rotation.\nAn extrapolation to the white dwarf regime predicts rotation periods between\n330 and .0052 days depending on mass and decoupling time.

However, both the PDF and the spectrum are still a matter of\ndebate, because theoretical predictions are limited and simulations of\nsupersonic turbulence require enormous resolutions to capture the\ninertial-range scaling. To advance our limited knowledge of compressible\nturbulence, we here present and analyse the world's largest simulations of\nsupersonic turbulence.

The spectrum of\nthe density-weighted velocity rho^(1/3)v, however, does not provide the\npreviously suggested universal scaling for supersonic turbulence.

In agreement with previous work,\nwe find that halo mass-gap is related to halo formation time and concentration.\nOn average, older and more highly concentrated halos have larger halo\nmass-gaps, and this trend is stronger than the mass-concentration relation over\na similar dynamic range. However, there is a large amount of scatter owing to\nthe transitory nature of the satellite subhalo population, which limits the use\nof the halo mass-gap statistic on an object-by-object basis. For example, we\nfind that 20% of very large halo mass-gap systems (akin to \"fossil groups\") are\nyoung, and have likely experienced a recent merger between a massive satellite\nsubhalo and the central subhalo. We relate halo mass-gap to the observable\nstellar mass-gap via abundance matching. Using a galaxy group catalog\nconstructed from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7, we find that the\nstar formation and structural properties of galaxies at fixed mass show no\ntrend with stellar mass-gap. This is despite a variation in halo-age of ~2.5\nGyr over ~1.2 dex in stellar mass-gap. Thus, we find no evidence to suggest\nthat the halo formation history significantly affects galaxy properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Jun 2013 20:00:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 2 Sep 2013 20:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

Secondly we find a very natural Laurent polynomial formula for Wcan by\nrestricting it to a `Lusztig torus' in Xcan.

The\nhigh temperatures (~5-40 MeV) prevailing in the merger remnant may provide\nthermal pressure support that could increase its maximum mass and, thus, its\nlife on a neutrino-cooling timescale. We investigate the role of thermal\npressure support in hypermassive merger remnants by computing sequences of\nspherically-symmetric and axisymmetric uniformly and differentially rotating\nequilibrium solutions to the general-relativistic stellar structure equations.\nUsing a set of finite-temperature nuclear equations of state, we find that hot\nmaximum-mass critically spinning configurations generally do not support larger\nbaryonic masses than their cold counterparts. However, subcritically spinning\nconfigurations with mean density of less than a few times nuclear saturation\ndensity yield a significantly thermally enhanced mass. Even without decreasing\nthe maximum mass, cooling and other forms of energy loss can drive the remnant\nto an unstable state. We infer secular instability by identifying approximate\nenergy turning points in equilibrium sequences of constant baryonic mass\nparametrized by maximum density. Energy loss carries the remnant along the\ndirection of decreasing gravitational mass and higher density until instability\ntriggers collapse. Since configurations with more thermal pressure support are\nless compact and thus begin their evolution at a lower maximum density, they\nremain stable for longer periods after merger.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Jun 2013 22:11:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 1 Jun 2014 21:18:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

We present an algorithm\nfor transforming the information present in the penetration testing tool to the\nplanning domain, and show how the scalability issues of attack graphs can be\nsolved using current planners.

Misidentification of the true source of this scatter can\nbias both the retrieved color-luminosity relation and cosmological parameter\nmeasurements.

The coding\nbased iterative approach works well even in the presence of Byzantine\n(malicious) sensors in the network. We further consider the effect of non-ideal\nchannels.

Our algorithms first construct a secondary image, derived\nfrom input image by pseudo-randomly extracting features that approximately\ncapture semi-global geometric characteristics. From the secondary image (which\ndoes not perceptually resemble the input), we further extract the final\nfeatures which can be used as a hash value (and can be further suitably\nquantized).

In the limited 3-50 AU separation range, the companion frequency is\nessentially constant from brown dwarfs to solar-type stars in the Hyades\ncluster, which is also in line with our current knowledge for field stars.\nCombining the binaries discovered in this surveys with those already known in\nthe Pleiades cluster reveals that very low-mass binaries in open clusters, as\nwell as in star-forming regions, are skewed toward lower mass ratios ($0.6\n\\lesssim q \\lesssim 0.8$) than are their field counterparts, a result that\ncannot be accounted for by selection effects.

A \"sparse sampling\" method offers a more affordable solution to this\nproblem: within a survey footprint covering a given survey volume, Vsurvey, we\nobserve only a fraction of the volume. The distribution of observed regions\nshould be chosen such that their separation is smaller than the length scale\ncorresponding to the wavenumber of interest. Then one can recover the power\nspectrum of galaxies with precision expected for a survey covering a volume of\nVsurvey (rather than the volume of the sum of observed regions) with the number\ndensity of galaxies given by the total number of observed galaxies divided by\nVsurvey (rather than the number density of galaxies within an observed region).\nWe find that regularly-spaced sampling yields an unbiased power spectrum with\nno window function effect, and deviations from regularly-spaced sampling, which\nare unavoidable in realistic surveys, introduce calculable window function\neffects and increase the uncertainties of the recovered power spectrum.

Cannon algorithm which dates\nback to 1969 was the first efficient algorithm for parallel matrix\nmultiplication providing theoretically optimal communication cost. However this\nalgorithm requires a square number of processors. In the mid 1990s, the SUMMA\nalgorithm was introduced. SUMMA overcomes the shortcomings of Cannon algorithm\nas it can be used on a non-square number of processors as well. Since then the\nnumber of processors in HPC platforms has increased by two orders of magnitude\nmaking the contribution of communication in the overall execution time more\nsignificant. Therefore, the state of the art parallel matrix multiplication\nalgorithms should be revisited to reduce the communication cost further. This\npaper introduces a new parallel matrix multiplication algorithm, Hierarchical\nSUMMA (HSUMMA), which is a redesign of SUMMA. Our algorithm reduces the\ncommunication cost of SUMMA by introducing a two-level virtual hierarchy into\nthe two-dimensional arrangement of processors. Experiments on an IBM BlueGene-P\ndemonstrate the reduction of communication cost up to 2.08 times on 2048 cores\nand up to 5.89 times on 16384 cores.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Jun 2013 12:17:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-19"}

With the current operational phase\nof the AMS-02 experiment and the ongoing development of a future dedicated\nexperiment, the General Antiparticle Spectrometer (GAPS), there are exciting\nprospects for a dark matter detection in the near future. In this paper we\ndevelop a detailed and complete re-analysis of the cosmic-ray antideuteron\nsignal, by discussing the main relevant issues related to antideuteron\nproduction and propagation through the interstellar medium and the heliosphere.\nIn particular, we first critically revisit the coalescence mechanism for\nantideuteron production in dark matter annihilation processes. Then, since\nantideuteron searches have their best prospects of detection at low kinetic\nenergies where the effect of the solar wind and magnetic field are most\nrelevant, we address the impact of solar modulation modeling on the\nantideuteron flux at the Earth by developing a full numerical 4D solution of\ncosmic rays transport in the heliosphere. We finally use these improved\npredictions to provide updated estimates of the reaching capabilities for\nAMS-02 and GAPS, compatible with the current constraints imposed by the\nantiprotons measurements of PAMELA. After the antiproton bound is applied,\nprospects of detection of up to about 15 events in GAPS LDB+ and AMS-02\nmissions are found, depending on the dark matter mass, annihilation rate and\nproduction channel from one side, and on the coalescence process, galactic and\nsolar transport parameters on the other.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Jun 2013 13:01:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 23 Aug 2013 13:13:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 25 Jul 2017 14:51:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-26"}

We focus on three specific structures: a putative bipolar outflow from\nthe vicinity of Sgr A*; a high surface brightness region located roughly 12\narcmin to the north-east of Sgr A*; and a lower surface-brightness extended\nloop feature seen to the south of Sgr A*. We show that all three structures are\nthermal in nature and have similar temperatures (kT ~ 1 keV). The inferred\nX-ray luminosities lie in the range (2 - 10) x 10^34 erg s^-1. In the case of\nthe bipolar feature we suggest that the hot plasma is produced by the\nshock-heating of the winds from massive stars within the Central Cluster,\npossibly collimated by the Circumnuclear Disc. Alternatively the outflow may be\ndriven by outbursts on Sgr A*, which follow tidal disruption events occurring\nat a rate of roughly 1 every 4000 yr. The north-east enhancement is centred on\na candidate PWN which has a relatively hard non-thermal X-ray spectrum. We\nsuggest that the coincident soft-thermal emission traces the core of a new\nthermal-composite supernova remnant, designated as SNR G0.13-0.12. There is no\nclear evidence for an associated radio shell but such a feature may be masked\nby the bright emission of the nearby Radio Arc and other filamentary\nstructures. SNR G0.13-0.12 is very likely interacting with the nearby molecular\ncloud, G0.11-0.11, and linked to the Fermi source, 2FGL J1746.4-2851c.

Tests with synthetic data\ndemonstrate that the algorithm converges over a wide class of underlying star\nformation rate forms.

Massive stars made a\nsmaller contribution to the chemical enrichment compared to the MW. The\nobserved differences between the bar and the disc speak in favour of an episode\nof enhanced star formation a few Gyr ago, occurring in the central parts of the\nLMC and leading to the formation of the bar. This is in agreement with recently\nderived star formation histories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Jun 2013 14:54:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

Specifically, in a\ndouble quantum dot an incoming electron is captured by one dot and the excess\nenergy is transferred to the neighboring dot and used to remove an electron\nfrom this dot. This process is due to long-range electron correlation and shown\nto be operative at rather large distances between the dots. The efficiency of\nthe process is greatly enhanced by preparing the double quantum dot such that\nthe incoming electron is initially captured by a two-electron resonance state\nof the system. In contrast to atoms and molecules in nature, double quantum\ndots can be manipulated to achieve this enhancement. This mechanism leads to a\nsurprisingly narrow distribution of the energy of the electron removed in the\nprocess which is explained by resonance theory. We argue that the process could\nbe exploited in practice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Jun 2013 15:37:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Aug 2013 12:49:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}
