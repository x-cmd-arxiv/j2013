Thus, in this paper, firstly the near sparse\nsystem modeling by Generalized Gaussian Distribution is recommended, where the\nsparsity is defined accordingly. Secondly, two modifications to the ZA-LMS\nalgorithm have been made. The $l_1$ norm penalty is replaced by a partial $l_1$\nnorm in the cost function, enhancing robustness without increasing the\ncomputational complexity. Moreover, the zero-point attraction item is weighted\nby the magnitude of estimation error which adjusts the zero-point attraction\nforce dynamically.

The relation between two subtypes, migraine without aura (MWoA)\nand migraine with aura (MWA), is explored with the aim to identify targets for\nneuromodulation techniques. To this end, a dynamically regulated control system\nis schematically reduced to a network of the trigeminal nerve, which innervates\nthe cranial circulation, an associated descending modulatory network of\nbrainstem nuclei, and parasympathetic vasomotor efferents. This extends the\nidea of a migraine generator region in the brainstem to a larger network and is\nstill simple and explicit enough to open up possibilities for mathematical\nmodeling in the future. In this study, it is suggested that the migraine\ngenerator network (MGN) is driven and may therefore respond differently to\ndifferent spatio-temporal noxious input in the migraine subtypes MWA and MWoA.\nThe noxious input is caused by a cortical perturbation of homeostasis, known as\nspreading depression (SD). The MGN might even trigger SD in the first place by\na failure in vasomotor control. As a consequence, migraine is considered as an\ninherently dynamical disease to which a linear course from upstream to\ndownstream events would not do justice.

Each matrix\nelement is a sum of products of elements in the input matrix taken over a\nsliding window. Any given product contributes to multiple output elements,\nthereby complicating parallelization. We present a novel algorithm that attains\nvery high parallelism without repeating multiplications or requiring inter-core\nsynchronization. Key to this is the assignment to each core of distinct\ndiagonal segments of the output matrix, selected such that no multiplications\nneed to be repeated yet only one core writes to any given output-matrix\nelement, and exploitation of a shared memory (including L1 cache) that obviates\nthe need for a corresponding awkward partitioning of the memory among cores.\nImplementation on Plurality's HyperCore shared-memory many-core architecture\ndemonstrates linear speedup of up to 64 cores and speedups of ~85X for 128\ncores. On an x86 system we demonstrate that the new algorithm has consider\nparallel speedups but also show that a sequential implementation of the new\nalgorithm outperforms the parallel implementation of the baseline approach. On\na quad-core x86 system, the new algorithm is 20X faster than sequential\nbaseline and 5X than parallel implementation of the baseline.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Mar 2013 02:48:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-12"}

One established example with topological order is the\nvalence bond solid (VBS) states in quantum antiferromagnets. The VBS states are\ndisordered spin liquids with no spontaneous symmetry breaking but most\ntypically manifest topological order known as hidden string order on 1D chain.\nInterestingly, the VBS models are based on mathematics analogous to fuzzy\ngeometry. We review applications of the mathematics of fuzzy super-geometry in\nthe construction of supersymmetric versions of VBS (SVBS) states, and give a\npedagogical introduction of SVBS models and their properties [arXiv:0809.4885,\n1105.3529, 1210.0299]. As concrete examples, we present detail analysis of\nsupersymmetric versions of SU(2) and SO(5) VBS states, i.e. UOSp(N|2) and\nUOSp(N|4) SVBS states whose mathematics are closely related to fuzzy two- and\nfour-superspheres. The SVBS states are physically interpreted as hole-doped VBS\nstates with superconducting property that interpolate various VBS states\ndepending on value of a hole-doping parameter. The parent Hamiltonians for SVBS\nstates are explicitly constructed, and their gapped excitations are derived\nwithin the single-mode approximation on 1D SVBS chains. Prominent features of\nthe SVBS chains are discussed in detail, such as a generalized string order\nparameter and entanglement spectra. It is realized that the entanglement\nspectra are at least doubly degenerate regardless of the parity of bulk\n(super)spins. Stability of topological phase with supersymmetry is discussed\nwith emphasis on its relation to particular edge (super)spin states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Mar 2013 04:51:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Apr 2013 10:59:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 27 Apr 2013 03:22:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-30"}

These networks are required of evaluation\nmechanisms and distributed control and configurations, so each peer will be\nable to communicate with other peers. Resilience to faults, failures and\nattacks, are the main requirements of most communication systems and networks\ntoday. Thus, since P2P networks can be individually used as an infrastructure\nand an alternative for many other communication networks, they have to be more\nreliable, and resilient to the faults, failures and attacks compared to the\nclient and server approach. In this work, we present a detailed study on the\nbehavior of various P2P networks toward faults and failures, and focus on\nfault-tolerance subject. We consider two different static failure scenarios:\na)a random strategy in which nodes or edges of the network will be removed with\nan equal probability and without any knowledge of the networks infrastructure,\nb)a targeted strategy that uses some information about the nodes, and in which\nthe nodes with the highest degree have the most priority to be attacked. By\nstatic faults, we mean a situation where the nodes or components encounter some\nfaults before the network starts to work or through its operation, and will\nremain faulty to the end of the work session. Our goal is to introduce various\nmeasures to analyzing P2P networks evaluating their vulnerability rate. The\npresented criteria can be used for evaluating the reliability and vulnerability\nof P2P networks toward both random and targeted failures. There is no limit to\nthe number and types of failures, the presented measures are able to be used\nfor different types of failures and even a wide range of networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Mar 2013 09:09:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-12"}

We show that varying the chemical potential (or magnetic field)\nperiodically in time can produce Majorana modes at the ends of a long chain. We\ndiscuss two kinds of periodic driving, periodic delta-function kicks and a\nsimple harmonic variation with time. We discuss some distinctive features of\nthe end modes such as the inverse participation ratio of their wave functions\nand their Floquet eigenvalues which are always equal to +/- 1 for time-reversal\nsymmetric systems. For the case of periodic delta-function kicks, we use the\neffective Hamiltonian of a system with periodic boundary conditions to define\ntwo topological invariants.

The\nsecond invariant is more powerful in that it always correctly predicts the\nnumbers of end modes with Floquet eigenvalues equal to +1 and -1, while the\nfirst invariant does not.

However, truncation of the\nShannon series suffers the drawback of slow convergence. Specifically, it is\nwell-known that the mean-square approximation error of the truncated series at\n$n$ points sampled at the exact Nyquist rate is of the order\n$O(\\frac1{\\sqrt{n}})$. We consider the reconstruction of bandlimited random\nprocesses from finite oversampling points, namely, the distance between\nconsecutive points is less than the Nyquist sampling rate. The optimal\ndeterministic linear reconstruction method and the associated intrinsic\napproximation error are studied. It is found that one can achieve\nexponentially-decaying (but not faster) approximation errors from oversampling.\nTwo practical reconstruction methods with exponential approximation ability are\nalso presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Mar 2013 10:22:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 21 Apr 2013 10:22:09 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 20 Jan 2014 14:08:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-21"}
