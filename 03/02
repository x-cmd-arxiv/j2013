In this paper, we study security of an ITS\nauthentication scheme proposed by Wegman & Carter, in the case of partially\nknown authentication key. This scheme uses a new authentication key in each\nauthentication attempt, to select a hash function from an Almost Strongly\nUniversal$_2$ hash function family. The partial knowledge of the attacker is\nmeasured as the trace distance between the authentication key distribution and\nthe uniform distribution; this is the usual measure in QKD. We provide direct\nproofs of security of the scheme, when using partially known key, first in the\ninformation-theoretic setting and then in terms of witness indistinguishability\nas used in the Universal Composability (UC) framework. We find that if the\nauthentication procedure has a failure probability $\\epsilon$ and the\nauthentication key has an $\\epsilon'$ trace distance to the uniform, then under\nITS, the adversary's success probability conditioned on an authentic\nmessage-tag pair is only bounded by $\\epsilon+|\\mT|\\epsilon'$, where $|\\mT|$ is\nthe size of the set of tags. Furthermore, the trace distance between the\nauthentication key distribution and the uniform increases to $|\\mT|\\epsilon'$\nafter having seen an authentic message-tag pair. Despite this, we are able to\nprove directly that the authenticated channel is indistinguishable from an\n(ideal) authentic channel (the desired functionality), except with probability\nless than $\\epsilon+\\epsilon'$. This proves that the scheme is\n($\\epsilon+\\epsilon'$)-UC-secure, without using the composability theorem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Mar 2013 16:19:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-25"}

The given scheme, based on the denoise-and-forward scheme\nproposed for two-way relaying by Popovski et al. in \\cite{PoY1}, employs two\nphases: Multiple Access (MA) phase and Broadcast (BC) phase with each phase\nutilizing one channel use and hence totally two channel uses. Physical layer\nnetwork-coding using the denoise-and-forward scheme was done for the two-way\nrelaying scenario in\\cite{KPT}, for three-way relaying scenario in \\cite{SVR},\nand for four-way relaying scenario in \\cite{ShR}. This paper employs\ndenoise-and-forward scheme for physical layer network coding of the $n$-way\nrelaying scenario illustrating with the help of the case $n = 5$ not dealt with\nso far. It is observed that adaptively changing the network coding map used at\nthe relay according to the channel conditions reduces the impact of multiple\naccess interference which occurs at the relay during the MA phase. These\nnetwork coding maps are chosen so that they satisfy a requirement called\n\\textit{exclusive law}. We show that when the $n$ users transmit points from\nthe same $M$-PSK $(M=2^{\\lambda})$ constellation, every such network coding map\nthat satisfies the exclusive law can be represented by a $n$-fold Latin\nHyper-Cube of side $M$. The singular fade subspaces resulting from the scheme\nare described and enumerated for general values of $n$ and $M$ and are\nclassified based on their removability in the given scenario. A network code\nmap to be used by the relay for the BC phase aiming at reducing the effect of\ninterference at the MA stage is obtained.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Mar 2013 17:29:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-04"}

These features are manifest at the\nlevel of the thermodynamical observables. We also compute the thermal sigma and\npion masses from the curvature of the effective potential. In the chiral limit,\nthis guarantees that the Goldstone's theorem is obeyed in the broken phase. A\nrealistic parametrization of the model in the N=4 case, based on the vacuum\nvalues of the curvature masses, shows that a sigma mass of around 450 MeV can\nbe obtained.

One promising approach to making such\nmeasurements involves analysis of the X-ray flux oscillations often seen during\nthermonuclear (type 1) X-ray bursts. These oscillations are almost certainly\nproduced by emission from hotter regions on the stellar surface modulated by\nthe rotation of the star. One consequence of the rotation is that the\noscillation should appear earlier at higher photon energies than at lower\nenergies. Ford (1999) found compelling evidence for such a hard lead in the\ntail oscillations of one type 1 burst from Aql X-1.

We present a simple calculation that\nreproduces the main results of our measurements as well as of previously\npublished measurements that had shown diffusion to be a flat or decreasing\nfunction of n. By accounting for effect of density on charge susceptibility we\nshow that, in p-type semiconductors, the regime we observe of increasing\nambipolar diffusion is unique to heavy doping and low temperature, where both\nthe holes and electrons are degenerate; in this regime the electronic and\nambipolar diffusion are nearly equal. The saturation is identified as a\ncrossover to ambipolar diffusion dominated by the majority carriers, the holes.\nAt short times the transient-grating signal rises gradually. This rise reveals\ncooling of hot electrons and, at high photocarrier density, allows us to\nmeasure ambipolar diffusion of 110 cm2/s in the hot-carrier regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Mar 2013 19:51:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

This torque depends on internal flows driven by the\noscillating pressure gradient associated with the warp, and on physical\nprocesses operating on smaller scales, which may include instability and\nturbulence. We introduce a local model for the detailed study of warped discs.\nStarting from the shearing sheet of Goldreich & Lynden-Bell, we impose the\noscillating geometry of the orbital plane by means of a coordinate\ntransformation.

Requiring program- mers to signal\nthreads explicitly results in many concurrency bugs due to missed\nnotifications, or notifications on wrong condition variables. In this paper, we\ndescribe an implementation of an au- tomatic signaling monitor in Java called\nAutoSynch that eliminates such concurrency bugs by removing the burden of\nsignaling from the programmer. We show that the belief that automatic signaling\nmonitors are prohibitively expensive is wrong. For most problems, programs\nbased on AutoSynch are almost as fast as those based on explicit signaling. For\nsome, AutoSynch is even faster than explicit signaling because it never uses\nsignalAll, whereas the programmers end up using signalAll with the explicit\nsignal mechanism. AutoSynch achieves efficiency in synchronization based on\nthree novel ideas. We introduce an operation called globalization that enables\nthe predicate evaluation in every thread, thereby reducing context switches\nduring the execution of the program. Secondly, AutoSynch avoids signalAll by\nusing a property called relay invari- ance that guarantees that whenever\npossible there is always at least one thread whose condition is true which has\nbeen signaled. Finally, AutoSynch uses a technique called predicate tagging to\nefficiently determine a thread that should be signaled. To evaluate the effi-\nciency of AutoSynch, we have implemented many different well- known\nsynchronization problems such as the producers/consumers problem, the\nreaders/writers problems, and the dining philosophers problem. The results show\nthat AutoSynch is almost as efficient as the explicit-signal monitor and even\nmore efficient for some cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Mar 2013 20:49:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-04"}

We consider these both MW-like and\nhigh-density (starburst) galaxies. With feedback present, all models produce\nidentical integrated star formation rates (SFRs), in agreement with the\nKennicutt relation. Without feedback all produce orders-of-magnitude excessive\nSFRs. This is totally dependent on feedback and independent of the SF law.\nHowever, the spatial and density distribution of SF depend strongly on the SF\ncriteria. Because cooling rates are generally fast and gas is turbulent,\ncriteria (4)-(7) are 'weak' and spread SF uniformly over the disk (above\ndensities n~0.01-0.1 cm^-3). A molecular criterion (3) localizes to higher\ndensities, but still a wide range; for Z Z_solar, it is similar to a density\nthreshold at n~1 cm^-3 (well below mean densities in the MW center or\nstarbursts). Fixed density thresholds (2) can always select the highest\ndensities, but must be adjusted for simulation resolution and galaxy\nproperties; the same threshold that works in a MW-like simulation will select\nnearly all gas in a starburst. Binding criteria (1) tend to adaptively select\nthe largest over-densities, independent of galaxy model or resolution, and\nautomatically predict clustered SF. We argue that this SF model is most\nphysically-motivated and presents significant numerical advantages in\nlarge-dynamic range simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Mar 2013 21:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Jul 2013 10:05:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-02"}

The first epoch shows the same general spectral characteristics\nas the later epochs (smooth continuum, narrow H and HeI emission lines), but\nthe IR continuum shape is substantially redder than the later epochs. The epoch\n1 continuum can be approximated by reddening the peak-luminosity (epoch 3)\nspectrum by E(B-V)=1.0 mag, but the blue color seen in visual-wavelength\nspectra at the same time indicates that strong wavelength-dependent extinction\nby circumstellar dust is not the correct explanation. Instead, we favor the\nhypothesis that the redder color before the brightening arises from excess\nemission from hot $\\sim$2000 K circumstellar dust. The minimum radius (120 AU)\ndeduced from the dust temperature and observed luminosity of the transient,\ncombined with the observed expansion speed in the precursor outbursts of SN\n2009ip, is consistent with an ejection at least 1.1 yr earlier. The mass of hot\ndust indicated by the IR excess is 4x10$^{-7}$ Msun, although this is only a\nlower limit since the near-IR data do not constrain the mass of cooler dust.\nThus, the observed pre-SN outbursts of this object were able to efficiently\nform dust into which the SN ejecta and radiation now propagate.

Clubs membership is\ndynamic, where the worst performing particles socialize more by joining more\nclubs to learn from other particles and the best performing particles are made\nto socialize less by leaving clubs to reduce their strong influence on other\nmembers. Particles return gradually to default membership level when they stop\nshowing extreme performance. Inertia weights of swarm members are made random\nwithin a predefined range.

Recently a number of approaches to learning\ndata-dependent hash functions have been developed. In this work, we propose a\ncolumn generation based method for learning data-dependent hash functions on\nthe basis of proximity comparison information. Given a set of triplets that\nencode the pairwise proximity comparison information, our method learns hash\nfunctions that preserve the relative comparison relationships in the data as\nwell as possible within the large-margin learning framework.

Unfortunately, the validity\nand accuracy of the unveiled patterns are strongly dependent on the amount of\nunavoidable noise pervading the data, such as the presence of homonymous\nindividuals in social networks. In the current paper, we investigate the\nproblem of name disambiguation in collaborative networks, a task that plays a\nfundamental role on a myriad of scientific contexts. In special, we use an\nunsupervised technique which relies on a particle competition mechanism in a\nnetworked environment to detect the clusters. It has been shown that, in this\nkind of environment, the learning process can be improved because the network\nrepresentation of data can capture topological features of the input data set.\nSpecifically, in the proposed disambiguating model, a set of particles is\nrandomly spawned into the nodes constituting the network. As time progresses,\nthe particles employ a movement strategy composed of a probabilistic convex\nmixture of random and preferential walking policies. In the former, the walking\nrule exclusively depends on the topology of the network and is responsible for\nthe exploratory behavior of the particles. In the latter, the walking rule\ndepends both on the topology and the domination levels that the particles\nimpose on the neighboring nodes. This type of behavior compels the particles to\nperform a defensive strategy, because it will force them to revisit nodes that\nare already dominated by them, rather than exploring rival territories.\nComputer simulations conducted on the networks extracted from the arXiv\nrepository of preprint papers and also from other databases reveal the\neffectiveness of the model, which turned out to be more accurate than\ntraditional clustering methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Mar 2013 03:41:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-12"}

Sunspots are strongly\nmagnetized regions and are generated by a dynamo mechanism which recreates the\nsolar polar field mediated via plasma flows. Here we report results from\nkinematic dynamo simulations which demonstrate that a fast meridional flow in\nthe early half of a cycle, followed by a slower flow in the latter half,\nreproduces both the characteristics of the minimum of sunspot cycle 23 - a\nlarge number of spotless days and a relatively weak polar field.

We also present\nfull 3D-LTE line formation calculations for some selected iron lines in the\nsolar and metal-poor 4480/2/-3 models and NLTE calculations with the\ncorresponding spatial and temporal average <3D> models. The use of the <3D>\nmodels is justified only for particular Fe I lines in particular physical\nconditions. Our NLTE calculations reproduce well the centre-to-limb variation\nof the solar Fe I 7780 A line, but they are unsuccessful for Fe I 6151 A. The\nmetal-poor <3D> model was found to be adequite for the strong Fe I 5166 A (Eexc\n= 0) line, but inadequite in all other investigated cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Mar 2013 05:43:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-05"}

Testing validates the real system behavior against models and\nchecks that the implementation conforms to them, but is capable also to find\nerrors in the models themselves.\n  The first MBT workshop was held in 2004, in Barcelona. At that time MBT\nalready had become a hot topic, but the MBT workshop was the first event\ndevoted mostly to this domain. Since that time the area has generated enormous\nscientific interest, and today there are several specialized workshops and more\nbroad conferences on software and hardware design and quality assurance\ncovering model based testing. MBT has become one of the most powerful system\nanalysis tools, one of the latest cutting-edge topics related is applying MBT\nin security analysis and testing.

By comparing these systems we can systematically investigate\ntheir adsorption nature and differences between the two functional versions\nvdW-DF1 and vdW-DF2. The bigger size of the C60 molecule makes it bind stronger\nto the surface than benzene, yet the interface between the molecules and the\nsheets are similar in nature. The binding separation is more sensitive to the\nexchange variant used in vdW-DF than to the correlation version. This result is\nrelated to the exchange and correlation components of the potential energy\ncurve (PEC). We show that a moderate dipole forms for C60 on graphene, unlike\nfor the other adsorption systems.
