Such a possibility seems to contradict the intuition that to\ndistribute entanglement, the transmitted system always needs to be entangled\nwith the sender. Here, we experimentally distribute entanglement by exchanging\na subsystem and successfully prove that this subsystem is not entangled with\neither of the two parties. Our implementation relies on the preparation of a\nspecific three-mode Gaussian state containing thermal noise that demolishes the\nentanglement in two of the three bipartite splittings. After transmission of a\nseparable mode this noise can be removed by quantum interference. Our work\ndemonstrates an unexpected variant of entanglement distribution and improves\nthe understanding necessary to engineer multipartite quantum information\nnetworks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Mar 2013 16:04:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 Mar 2013 10:03:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-16"}

We\nthus determine the metals-to-dust ratio in a unique way, providing direct\ndeterminations of in situ gas and dust columns without recourse to assumptions\nwith large uncertainties. We find that the metals-to-dust ratios in these\nsystems are surprisingly close to the value for the local group (10^{21.3} cm-2\nA_V mag-1), with a mean value of 10^{21.2} cm-2 A_V mag-1 and a standard\ndeviation of 0.3 dex.

Formation of the bulk of the\ndust in low mass stars is therefore ruled out by these data at any cosmic\nepoch.

We investigate possible QSL phases in the presence of\nexperimentally relevant spin-rotation symmetry-breaking perturbations such as\nDzyaloshinskii-Moriya and Ising interactions, as well as second-neighbour\nantiferromagnetic Heisenberg interactions. We use the projective symmetry group\nanalysis within the slave-fermion framework of QSL phases and systematically\nclassify possible QSLs in the presence of these perturbations. The dynamical\nspin-structure factor for relevant QSLs is computed and their effects are\nstudied. Our calculations reveal dispersive features in the spin structure\nfactor embedded in a generally diffuse background due to the existence of\nfractionalized S=1/2 excitations called spinons. For two of the previously\nproposed $Z_2$ states, the dispersive features are almost absent, and diffuse\nscattering dominates over a large energy window throughout the Brillouin zone.\nThis resembles the structure factor observed in recent inelastic neutron\nscattering experiments on singlet crystals of Herbertsmithite. Furthermore, one\nof the $Z_2$ states with the spin structure factor with mostly diffuse\nscattering is gapped, and it may be adiabatically connected to the gapped QSL\nstate observed in recent DMRG calculations for the NN HAF. The above\nperturbations are found to enhance the diffuse nature of the spin structure\nfactor and reduce the momentum dependencies of the spin gap.

In this paper, we investigate the validity domain of this\nassumption. Indeed, that premise disregards microlensing of the accretion disc\nin the MIR range, and does not account for recent progress in our knowledge of\nthe dusty torus. To simulate microlensing, we first built a simplified image of\nthe quasar composed of an accretion disc, and of a larger ring-like torus. The\nmock quasars are then microlensed using an inverse ray-shooting code. We\nsimulated the wavelength and size dependence of microlensing for different\nlensed image types and fraction of compact objects projected in the lens. This\nallows us to derive magnification probabilities as a function of wavelength, as\nwell as to calculate the microlensing-induced deformation of the spectral\nenergy distribution of the lensed images. We find that microlensing variations\nas large as 0.1 mag are very common at 11 microns (observer-frame). The main\nsignal comes from microlensing of the accretion disc, which may be significant\neven when the fraction of flux from the disc is as small as 5 % of the total\nflux. We also show that the torus of sources with Lbol <~ 10^45 erg/s is\nexpected to be noticeably microlensed. Microlensing may thus be used to get\ninsight into the rest near-infrared inner structure of AGNs. Finally, we\ninvestigate whether microlensing in the mid-infrared can alter the so-called\nRcusp relation that links the fluxes of the lensed images triplet produced when\nthe source lies close to a cusp macro-caustic. This relation is commonly used\nto identify massive (dark-matter) substructures in lensing galaxies. We find\nthat significant deviations from Rcusp may be expected, which means that\nmicrolensing can explain part of the flux ratio problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Mar 2013 21:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 6 Jun 2013 13:43:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-07"}

We have selected a sample of 4 nearby resolved galaxies and a sample\nof 27 unresolved galaxies from the Herschel Reference Survey and the Very\nNearby Galaxies Survey, for which we have a large set of multi-wavelength data\nfrom the FUV to the FIR including metallicity gradients for resolved galaxies,\nalong with radio HI and CO observations.

We provide new, simple to use, relations to determine the face-on\noptical depth from the gas surface density, taking the metallicity into\naccount, which proves to be crucial for a proper estimate.

The inverse-Compton emission in\nour fits is due to inverse-Compton scattering of high-redshift CMB photons at\nlarge distances along the jet due to the high bulk Lorentz factors of the jets.\nWe postulate a new interpretation of the blazar sequence based on the radius of\nthe transition region of the jet (where the jet is brightest in synchrotron\nemission) scaling linearly with black hole mass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Mar 2013 21:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

In this work, we give conditions that are necessary and\nsufficient for the true class-conditional distributions to be identifiable.\nThese conditions are weaker than those analyzed previously, and allow for the\nclasses to be nonseparable and the noise levels to be asymmetric and unknown.\nThe conditions essentially state that a majority of the observed labels are\ncorrect and that the true class-conditional distributions are \"mutually\nirreducible,\" a concept we introduce that limits the similarity of the two\ndistributions.

The model is based on a projection of the\ndynamical evolution of Navier-Stokes (NS) equations into the subspace where\nhelicity (the $L^2-$scalar product of velocity and vorticity) is sign-definite.\nThe presence of a second (beside energy) sign-definite inviscid conserved\nquadratic quantity, which is equivalent to the $H^{1/2}-$Sobolev norm, allows\nus to demonstrate global existence and uniqueness, of space-periodic solutions,\ntogether with continuity with respect to the initial conditions, for this\ndecimated 3D model. This is achieved thanks to the establishment of two new\nestimates, for this 3D model, which show that the $H^{1/2}$ and the time\naverage of the square of the $H^{3/2}$ norms of the velocity field remain\nfinite. Such two additional bounds are known, in the spirit of the work of H.\nFujita and T. Kato \\cite{kato1,kato2}, to be sufficient for showing\nwell-posedness for the 3D NS equations.

One way\nto distinguish between the SDS and the double-degenerate scenario is to search\nfor the post-impact remnant stars (PIRSs) in SN Ia remnants. Using a technique\nthat combines multi-dimensional hydrodynamics simulations with one-dimensional\nstellar evolution simulations, we have examined the post-impact evolution of\nhelium-rich binary companions in the SDS. It is found that these helium-rich\nPIRSs (He PIRSs) dramatically expand and evolve to a luminous phase ($L\\sim\n10^4 L_\\odot$) about 10 years after a supernova explosion. Subsequently, they\ncontract and evolve to become hot blue-subdwarf-like (sdO-like) stars by\nreleasing gravitational energy, persisting as sdO-like stars for several\nmillion years before evolving to the helium red-giant phase.

The stronger photometric period around 0.12245 d, which had been\ndetected from the ground-based observation, was found to be variable, and we\nidentified this period as being the positive superhump period. This superhump\nperiod showed short-term (10-20 d) and strong variations in period most\nunexpectedly when the object entered a slightly faint state. The fractional\nsuperhump excess varied as large as ~30%. The variation of the period very well\ntraced the variation of the brightness of the system. The time-scales of this\nvariation of the superhump period was too slow to be interpreted as the\nvariation caused by the change in the disk radius due to the thermal disk\ninstability. We interpreted that the period variation was caused by the varying\npressure effect on the period of positive superhumps.

We suggest that the predicted nonconsensus\nbinding mechanism provides a genome-wide background for specific promoter\nelements, such as transcription factor binding sites, TATA-like elements, and\nspecific binding of the PIC components to nucleosomes.

In agreement with\nobservations, we find that most BRC line profiles are symmetric and that\nasymmetries can be either red or blue, in contrast to the blue-dominance\nexpected for a collapsing cloud. Asymmetries in the line profiles arise when an\noptically thick line is dominated by the shell and an optically thin line is\ndominated by the cloud interior to the shell.

We focus on a spatial adaptation of Aloha within the\nframework of ad hoc networks. We consider quasi-static networks in which\nmobiles learn the local topology and incorporate this information to adapt\ntheir medium access probability (MAP) selection to their local environment. We\nconsider the cases where nodes cooperate in a distributed way to maximize the\nglobal throughput or to achieve either proportional fair or max-min fair medium\naccess. In the proportional fair case, we show that nodes can compute their\noptimal MAPs as solutions to certain fixed point equations. In the maximum\nthroughput case, the optimal MAPs are obtained through a Gibbs Sampling based\nalgorithm. In the max min case, these are obtained as the solution of a convex\noptimization problem. The main performance analysis result of the paper is that\nthis type of distributed adaptation can be analyzed using stochastic geometry\nin the proportional fair case. In this case, we show that, when the nodes form\na homogeneous Poisson point process in the Euclidean plane, the distribution of\nthe optimal MAP can be obtained from that of a certain shot noise process\nw.r.t. the node Poisson point process and that the mean utility can also be\nderived from this distribution. We discuss the difficulties to be faced for\nanalyzing the performance of the other cases (maximum throughput and max-min\nfairness).

In particular, it introduces U-Plan, a planning system that\nconstructs quantitatively ranked plans given an incomplete description of the\nstate of the world. U-Plan uses a DempsterShafer interval to characterise\nuncertain and incomplete information about the state of the world. The planner\ntakes as input what is known about the world, and constructs a number of\npossible initial states with representations at different abstraction levels. A\nplan is constructed for the initial state with the greatest support, and this\nplan is tested to see if it will work for other possible initial states. All,\npart, or none of the existing plans may be used in the generation of the plans\nfor the remaining possible worlds. Planning takes place in an abstraction\nhierarchy where strategic decisions are made before tactical decisions. A\nsuper-plan is then constructed, based on merging the set of plans and the\nappropriately timed acquisition of essential knowledge, which is used to decide\nbetween plan alternatives.

To help reduce the conflict between these two\napproaches, this paper reexamines expected utility theory-from which Bayesian\nprobability theory is derived. Expected utility theory requires the decision\nmaker to assign a utility to each decision conditioned on every possible event\nthat might occur. But frequently the decision maker cannot foresee all the\nevents that might occur, i.e., one of the possible events is the occurrence of\nan unforeseen event. So once we acknowledge the existence of unforeseen events,\nwe need to develop some way of assigning utilities to decisions conditioned on\nunforeseen events. The commonsensical solution to this problem is to assign\nsimilar utilities to events which are similar. Implementing this commonsensical\nsolution is equivalent to replacing Bayesian subjective probabilities over the\nspace of foreseen and unforeseen events by random set theory probabilities over\nthe space of foreseen events. This leads to an expected utility principle in\nwhich normalized variants of Shafer's commonalities play the role of subjective\nprobabilities. Hence allowing for unforeseen events in decision analysis causes\nBayesian probability theory to become much more similar to Shaferian theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Mar 2013 14:23:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-08"}

The policy\nimplications are clear: legislators, administrators, investors, media\nrepresentatives, and members of the public who value honest numbers should not\ntrust cost estimates and cost-benefit analyses produced by project promoters\nand their analysts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Mar 2013 11:22:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-27"}

Comparing the\nresults, we find that the three prescriptions yield identical energy\ndistributions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Mar 2013 17:46:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-23"}
