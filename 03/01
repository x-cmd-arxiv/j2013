Provided\nthat this alpha-effect operates more efficiently than (turbulent) magnetic\ndiffusion, such a system should be capable of sustaining a large-scale dynamo.\nHowever, in the Boussinesq model that was considered by Cattaneo&Hughes (2006)\nthe dynamo produced small-scale, intermittent magnetic fields with no\nsignificant large-scale component. In this paper, we consider the compressible\nanalogue of the rotating convective layer that was considered by\nCattaneo&Hughes (2006). Varying the horizontal scale of the computational\ndomain, we investigate the dependence of the dynamo upon the rotation rate. Our\nsimulations indicate that these turbulent compressible flows can drive a\nsmall-scale dynamo but, even when the layer is rotating very rapidly (with a\nmid-layer Taylor number of Ta=10^8), we find no evidence for the generation of\na significant large-scale component of the magnetic field on a dynamical\ntimescale. Like Cattaneo&Hughes(2006), we measure a negligible (time-averaged)\nalpha-effect when a uniform horizontal magnetic field is imposed across the\ncomputational domain. Although the total horizontal magnetic flux is a\nconserved quantity in these simulations, the (depth-dependent)\nhorizontally-averaged magnetic field always exhibits strong fluctuations. If\nthese fluctuations are artificially suppressed within the code, we measure a\nsignificant mean electromotive force that is comparable to that found in\nrelated calculations in which the alpha-effect is measured using the test-field\nmethod, even though we observe no large-scale dynamo action.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Feb 2013 16:12:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-06"}

Our method requires 30% to 40% less memory with respect to\nthe method of [3], with insignificant impact to construction time. At the same\ntime, our experiments showed a better query time compared to [3]. This is, to\nour knowledge, the best practical representation for de Bruijn graphs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Feb 2013 18:35:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 May 2013 15:25:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-22"}

This is the cornerstone of a\nspectral characterization of subspace recurrence that generalizes some of the\nmain results in the above mentioned paper. The spectral decomposition of the\nunitary step operator driving the evolution yields a spectral measure, which we\nproject onto the subspace to obtain a new spectral measure that is purely\nsingular iff the subspace is recurrent, and consists of a pure point spectrum\nwith a finite number of masses precisely when all states in the subspace have a\nfinite expected return time.\n  This notion of subspace recurrence also links the concept of expected return\ntime to an Aharonov-Anandan phase that, in contrast to the case of state\nrecurrence, can be non-integer. Even more surprising is the fact that averaging\nsuch geometrical phases over the absorbing subspace yields an integer with a\ntopological meaning, so that the averaged expected return time is always a\nrational number. Moreover, state recurrence can occasionally give higher return\nprobabilities than subspace recurrence, a fact that reveals once more the\ncounterintuitive behavior of quantum systems.\n  All these phenomena are illustrated with explicit examples, including as a\nnatural application the analysis of site recurrence for coined walks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Feb 2013 19:05:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

To follow the slow evolution of subsonic motions,\nvarious sound-proof models attempt to remove fast acoustic waves whilst\nretaining stratified convection and buoyancy dynamics. In astrophysics,\nanelastic models typically receive the most attention in the class of\nsound-filtered stratified models. Generally, anelastic models remain valid in\nnearly adiabatically stratified regions like stellar convection zones, but may\nbreak down in strongly sub-adiabatic, stably stratified layers common in\nstellar radiative zones. However, studying stellar rotation, circulation, and\ndynamos requires understanding the complex coupling between convection and\nradiative zones, and this requires robust equations valid in both regimes. Here\nwe extend the analysis of equation sets begun in Brown Vasil & Zweibel 2012,\nwhich studied anelastic models, to two types of pseudo-incompressible models.\nThis class of models has received attention in atmospheric applications, and\nmore recently in studies of white-dwarf supernovae progenitors.

We use Lagrangian\nvariational methods to extend the energy conserving model to a general equation\nof state, and dub the resulting equation set the Generalized\nPseudo-Incompressible (GPI) model.

We consider diffuse gas densities (n_H=10^-5-10^-3\ncm^-3) exposed to the extra-galactic background (EGB) and initially in thermal\nequilibrium (T \\sim 10^4-10^4.5 K). Once the proximate AGN field turns on,\nadditional photo-ionisation rapidly ionises the HI and metals. The enhanced AGN\nradiation field turns off after a typical AGN lifetime (tau_AGN=1-20 Myr) and\nthe field returns to the EGB intensity, but the metals remain out of ionisation\nequilibrium for timescales that can significantly exceed tau_AGN. We define\nthis phase as the AGN proximity zone \"fossil\" phase and show that high\nionisation stages (e.g. OVI, NeVIII, MgX) are in general enhanced, while the\nabundances of low ions are reduced. In contrast, HI re-equilibrates rapidly\n(<<tau_AGN) owing to its low neutral fraction at diffuse densities.

However there is a small chance that it was born\nrecently, with a low magnetic field. If so, upper limits on the X-ray flux\nsuggest but can not prove that PSR J2007+2722 is at least ~ 100 kyr old.

With the advent of deeper imaging surveys\nfrom, e.g., the HST and VISTA, there are a plethora of spectroscopic targets\nwhich are already beyond the sensitivity limits of current facilities. This\nwealth of targets will grow even more rapidly in the coming years, e.g., after\nthe completion of ALMA, the launch of the JWST and Euclid, and the advent of\nthe LSST. Thus, one of the key requirements underlying plans for the next\ngeneration of ground-based telescopes, the Extremely Large Telescopes (ELTs),\nis for even greater sensitivity for optical and infrared spectroscopy. Here we\nrevisit the scientific motivation for a MOS capability on the European ELT,\ncombining updated elements of science cases advanced from the Phase A\ninstrument studies with new science cases which draw on the latest results and\ndiscoveries. These science cases address key questions related to galaxy\nevolution over cosmic time, from studies of resolved stellar populations in\nnearby galaxies out to observations of the most distant galaxies, and are used\nto identify the top-level requirements on an 'E-ELT/MOS'. We argue that several\nof the most compelling ELT science cases demand MOS observations, in highly\ncompetitive areas of modern astronomy. Recent technical studies have\ndemonstrated that important issues related to e.g. sky subtraction and\nmulti-object AO can be solved, making fast- track development of a MOS\ninstrument feasible. To ensure that ESO retains world leadership in exploring\nthe most distant objects in the Universe, galaxy evolution and stellar\npopulations, we are convinced that a MOS should have high priority in the\ninstrumentation plan for the E-ELT.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Feb 2013 21:46:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-04"}

In extensions of the standard model allowing for the\npresence of DeltaNnu equivalent neutrinos (or dark radiation), Neff is\ngenerally >3. The canonical results are reconsidered here, revealing that a\nmeasurement of Neff>3 can be consistent with DeltaNnu=0 (dark radiation without\ndark radiation). Conversely, a measurement consistent with Neff=3 is not\ninconsistent with the presence of dark radiation (DeltaNnu>0). In particular,\nif there is a light WIMP that annihilates to photons after the SM neutrinos\nhave decoupled, the photons are heated beyond their usual heating from e+-\nannihilation, reducing the late time ratio of neutrino and photon temperatures\n(and number densities), leading to Neff<3. This opens the window for one or\nmore equivalent neutrinos, including sterile neutrinos, to be consistent with\nNeff=3. By reducing the neutrino number density at present, this allows for\nmore massive neutrinos, relaxing the current constraints on the sum of the\nneutrino masses. In contrast, if the light WIMP only couples to the SM\nneutrinos and not to the photons, its late time annihilation heats the\nneutrinos but not the photons, resulting in Neff>3 even in the absence of\nequivalent neutrinos or dark radiation. A measurement of Neff>3 is thus no\nguarantee of the presence of equivalent neutrinos or dark radiation. In the\npresence of light WIMPs and/or equivalent neutrinos there are degeneracies\namong the light WIMP mass and its nature (fermion or boson, as well as its\ncouplings to neutrinos or photons), the number and nature (fermion or boson) of\nthe equivalent neutrinos, and their decoupling temperature (the strength of\ntheir interactions with the SM particles).

For\nexample, the Ginzburg--Landau equation is a normal form that describes pattern\nformation due to the appearance of a single mode of instability in a wide\nvariety of dissipative problems. In a similar vein, a certain \"single-wave\nmodel\" arises in many physical contexts that share common pattern forming\nbehavior. These systems have Hamiltonian structure, and the single-wave model\nis a kind of Hamiltonian mean-field theory describing the patterns that form in\nphase space. The single-wave model was originally derived in the context of\nnonlinear plasma theory, where it describes the behavior near threshold and\nsubsequent nonlinear evolution of unstable plasma waves. However, the\nsingle-wave model also arises in fluid mechanics, specifically shear-flow and\nvortex dynamics, galactic dynamics, the XY and Potts models of condensed matter\nphysics, and other Hamiltonian theories characterized by mean field\ninteraction. We demonstrate, by a suitable asymptotic analysis, how the\nsingle-wave model emerges from a large class of nonlinear advection-transport\ntheories. An essential ingredient for the reduction is that the Hamiltonian\nsystem has a continuous spectrum in the linear stability problem, arising not\nfrom an infinite spatial domain but from singular resonances along curves in\nphase space whereat wavespeeds match material speeds (wave-particle resonances\nin the plasma problem, or critical levels in fluid problems).

To that end a variety of models such as Petri-nets or Finite State\nMachines may be utilized. These models specify actions to be executed, such as\ninvoking operations or configuring components to achieve a certain goal.\n  This traditional approach has several disadvantages related to loss of\nreusability of coordination models due to coupling with platform-specific\nfunctionality, non-deterministic temporal behavior and limited robustness as a\nresult of executing platform operations within the context of the coordinator.\n  To avoid these shortcomings, we propose to split this \"rich\" coordinator into\na Pure Coordinator and a Configurator. Although the coordinator remains in\ncharge of commanding and reacting, the execution of actions is deferred to the\nConfigurator. This pattern, called \"Coordinator-Configurator\", is implemented\nas a novel Configurator domain specific language that can be used together with\nany model of coordination. We illustrate the approach by refactoring an\nexisting application that realizes a safe haptic coupling of two youBot mobile\nmanipulators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Mar 2013 02:27:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-04"}

Interpreting the returnability index as\nan equilibrium constant for a reaction network in equilibrium with a\nhypothetical reference system, enables us to quantify the extent to which a\nmetabolic network is in disequilibrium. Further, by introducing a new directed\ncentrality measure via an extension of the subgraph centrality metric to\ndirected networks, we are able to characterise individual metabolites by their\nparticipation within metabolic pathways. To demonstrate these ideas, we study\n116 metabolic networks of bacteria.

Common adaptive optics systems require\ndedicated components to perform wave-front analysis. The ultimate wave-front\nmeasurement performance is thus limited by the unavoidable differential\naberrations between the wavefront sensor and the scientific camera. To reach\nthe level of detectivity required by high-contrast imaging, these differential\naberrations must be estimated and compensated for.

However, the overshoot mixing is a long standing problem. The\nuncertainty of the overshoot mixing is one of the most uncertain factors in\nstellar physics. As it is well known, the convective and overshoot mixing is\ndetermined by the radial chemical component flux. In this paper, a local model\nof the radial chemical component flux is established based on the hydrodynamic\nequations and some model assumptions. The model is tested in stellar models.\nThe main conclusions are as follows. (i) The local model shows that the\nconvective and overshoot mixing could be regarded as a diffusion process, and\nthe diffusion coefficient for different chemical element is the same. However,\nif the non-local terms, i.e., the turbulent convective transport of radial\nchemical component flux, are taken into account, the diffusion coefficient for\neach chemical element should be in general different. (ii) The diffusion\ncoefficient of convective / overshoot mixing shows different behaviors in\nconvection zone and in overshoot region because the characteristic length scale\nof the mixing is large in the convection zone and small in the overshoot\nregion. The overshoot mixing should be regarded as a weak mixing process. (iii)\nThe result of the diffusion coefficient of mixing is tested in stellar models.\nIt is found that a single choice of our central mixing parameter leads to\nconsistent results for a solar convective envelope model as well as for core\nconvection models of stars with mass from 2M to 10M.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Mar 2013 10:36:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-16"}

We first propose an LP based solution for secure communication against\neavesdropping, and show that it is information-theoretically rate-optimal among\nall routing-only schemes.

Our aim is to test the validity of the\nseismic diagnostics for red giants rotation that are based on a perturbative\nmethod and to investigate the oscillation spectra when the validity does not\nhold. We use a non-perturbative approach implemented in the ACOR code (Ouazzani\net al. 2012) that accounts for the effect of rotation on pulsations, and solves\nthe pulsation eigenproblem directly for dipolar oscillation modes. We find that\nthe limit of the perturbation to first order can be expressed in terms of the\nrotational splitting compared to the frequency separation between consecutive\ndipolar modes. Above this limit, non-perturbative computations are necessary\nbut only one term in the spectral expansion of modes is sufficient as long as\nthe core rotation rate remains significantly smaller than the pulsation\nfrequencies. Each family of modes with different azimuthal symmetry, m, has to\nbe considered separately. In particular, in case of rapid core rotation, the\ndensity of the spectrum differs significantly from one m-family of modes to\nanother, so that the differences between the period spacings associated with\neach m-family can constitute a promising guideline toward a proper seismic\ndiagnostic for rotation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Mar 2013 13:26:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

However, there are a number of important\nissues which remain unresolved. The energy repartition amongst particle\npopulations in quasiperpendicular shocks is a multi-scale process related to\nthe spatial and temporal structure of the electromagnetic fields within the\nshock layer. The most important processes take place in the close vicinity of\nthe major magnetic transition or ramp region. The distribution of\nelectromagnetic fields in this region determines the characteristics of ion\nreflection and thus defines the conditions for ion heating and energy\ndissipation for supercritical shocks and also the region where an important\npart of electron heating takes place. All of these processes are crucially\ndependent upon the characteristic spatial scales of the ramp and foot region\nprovided that the shock is stationary. The earliest studies of collisionless\nshocks identified nonlinearity, dissipation, and dispersion as the processes\nthat arrest the steepening of the shock transition. Their relative role\ndetermines the scales of electric and magnetic fields, and so control the\ncharacteristics of processes such as of ion reflection, electron heating and\nparticle acceleration. The purpose of this review is to address a subset of\nunresolved problems in collisionless shock physics from experimental point of\nview making use multi-point observations onboard Cluster satellites. The\nproblems we address are determination of scales of fields and of a scale of\nelectron heating, identification of energy source of precursor wave train, an\nestimate of the role of anomalous resistivity in energy dissipation process by\nmeans of measuring short scale wave fields, and direct observation of\nreformation process during one single shock front crossing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Mar 2013 15:23:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

While observations of open clusters\npropose a universal picture for the IMF from the substellar domain up to a few\nsolar masses, the young association eta Chamaeleontis presents an apparent lack\nof low mass objects (m<0.1 Msun). Another unusual feature of this cluster is\nthe absence of wide binaries with a separation > 50 AU. We aim to test whether\ndynamical evolution alone can reproduce the peculiar properties of the\nassociation assuming a universal IMF. We use a pure N-body code to simulate the\ndynamical evolution of the cluster for 10 Myr, and compare the results with\nobservations. A wide range of values for the initial parameters are tested in\norder to identify the initial state that would most likely lead to\nobservations. In this context we also investigate the influence of the initial\nbinary population on the dynamics and the possibility of having a discontinuous\nsingle IMF near the transition to the brown dwarf regime. We consider as an\nextreme case an IMF with no low mass systems (m<0.1 Msun). The initial\nconfigurations cover a wide range of initial density, from 10^2 to 10^8\nstars/pc^3, in virialized, hot and cold dynamical state. We do not find any\ninitial state that would evolve from a universal single IMF to fit the\nobservations. Only when starting with a truncated IMF without any very low mass\nsystems and no wide binaries, can we reproduce the cluster core properties with\na success rate of 10% at best. Pure dynamical evolution alone cannot explain\nthe observed properties of eta Cha from universal initial conditions. The lack\nof brown dwarfs and very low mass stars, and the peculiar binary properties\n(low binary fraction and lack of wide binaries), are probably the result of the\nstar formation process in this association.

It is easy to verify that the operation\ngenerating $(a,\\, b,\\, c,\\, a+b+c-d)$ from $(a,\\, b,\\, c,\\, d)$ preserves this\nfeature and that it and analogous ones for the other elements can be\nrepresented by four matrices. We examine in detail the triangle group, the\ngroup with these operations as generators, and completely classify the orbits\nof quadruples with respect to the triangle group action. We also compute the\nnumber of triangle quadruples generated after a certain number of operations\nand approximate the number of quadruples bounded by characteristics such as the\nmaximal element. Finally, we prove that the triangle group is a hyperbolic\nCoxeter group and derive information about the elements of triangle quadruples\nby invoking Lie groups. We also generalize the problem to higher dimensions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Mar 2013 15:53:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-04"}

In this paper, Casimir pressure effect by deploying\nmagnetically tunable surface plasmon quanta in stratified structure of using\nferrite and metal wires is presented. Previously, oscillating surface plasmon\nquanta were successfully included to modify first reflection and first\ntransmission characteristics. The oscillating surface plasmon quanta in the\nmodified reflection in such a system, not only does resolve in a typical matter\nin metamaterial, but also provide new applications such as creating Casimir\npressure effects through the metamaterial composite shown in this paper. The\nCasimir pressure flips from attractive state to repulsive state is referred to\ncause mechanism of radiation from surface plasmon quanta. Both Casimir force\nanalysis and the measured data of radiations indicate us the system develops\nquantized states by electric flux induced by ferromagnetic resonance. Quantum\nanalysis is used to understand the discrete radiations spectra for our\nexperimental measurement. The discrete radiations are reproduced by using time\ndependent Schr\\\"odinger representation. As a result, we find the Josephson\nfrequency and Josephson current representations at room temperature and we used\nthem for extrapolating voltage induced in excited ferrites. Josephson frequency\nat X-band is able to differentiate micron volt differences and it allows us to\nreport the data for voltage induced by ferromagnetic resonance in ferrite at\nroom temperature. It is understood that the radiation intensity depends on\ndensity of final states and excitation probability when we come to think the\nenergy matter. It seems possible to create as high as 20mW microwave power\ninside waveguide at X-band.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Mar 2013 15:59:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Oct 2013 10:14:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-08"}

For two such wells in series with certain parameter\ncombinations, we find that there is an appreciable velocity range for which\nsolitons can propagate in one direction only.

However,\nmany real-world networks, such as the social network Twitter and the WWW\nnetworks, upon which information, emotion or malware spreads, are shown to be\ndirected networks, composed of both unidirectional links and bidirectional\nlinks. We define the directionality as the percentage of unidirectional links.\nThe epidemic threshold for the susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) epidemic\nhas been proved to be 1/lambda_{1} in directed networks by N-intertwined\nMean-field Approximation, where lambda_{1}, also called as spectral radius, is\nthe largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix. Here, we propose two algorithms\nto generate directed networks with a given degree distribution, where the\ndirectionality can be controlled. The effect of directionality on the spectral\nradius lambda_{1}, principal eigenvector x_{1}, spectral gap\nlambda_{1}-|lambda_{2}|) and algebraic connectivity |mu_{N-1}| is studied.\nImportant findings are that the spectral radius lambda_{1} decreases with the\ndirectionality, and the spectral gap and the algebraic connectivity increase\nwith the directionality. The extent of the decrease of the spectral radius\ndepends on both the degree distribution and the degree-degree correlation\nrho_{D}. Hence, the epidemic threshold of directed networks is larger than that\nof undirected networks, and a random walk converges to its steady-state faster\nin directed networks than in undirected networks with degree distribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Mar 2013 14:20:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 2 Dec 2013 16:02:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}
