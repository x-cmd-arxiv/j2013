Based on the observed dichotomy in the ages\nof stellar populations of early-type galaxies on one side and late-type\ngalaxies on the other, the model interprets the epoch-dependent LFs at z \\geq\n1.5 using a physical model for the evolution of proto-spheroidal galaxies and\nof the associated AGNs, while IR galaxies at z<1.5 are interpreted as being\nmostly late-type 'cold' (normal) and 'warm' (starburst) galaxies. As for\nproto-spheroids, in addition to the epoch-dependent LFs of stellar and AGN\ncomponents separately, we have worked out the evolving LFs of these objects as\na whole (stellar plus AGN component). The model provides a physical explanation\nfor the observed positive evolution of both galaxies and AGNs up to z \\simeq\n2.5 and for the negative evolution at higher redshifts, for the sharp\ntransition from Euclidean to extremely steep counts at (sub-)mm wavelengths, as\nwell as the (sub-)mm counts of strongly lensed galaxies, that are hard to\naccount for by alternative, physical or phenomenological, approaches. The\nevolution of late-type galaxies and of z<1.5 AGNs is described using a\nparametric phenomenological approach. The modeled AGN contributions to the\ncounts and to the cosmic infrared background (CIB) are always subdominant with\nmaximal at mid-IR wavelengths. The model provides a good fit to the\nmulti-wavelength (from the mid-IR to millimeter waves) data on LFs at different\nredshifts and on number counts (both global and per redshift slices). A\nprediction of the present model is a systematic variation with wavelength of\nthe populations dominating the counts and the contributions to the CIB\nintensity. The implied specific trend for cross-wavelength CIB power spectra is\nfound to be in good agreement with the data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Mar 2013 16:11:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-26"}

Our theoretical estimates and simulations show that for\nthe X-ray luminosity L_X \\sim 0.008 L_{Edd}, the gas is thermally and\nconvectivelly unstable within the computational domain. In the simulations, we\nobserve that very tiny fluctuations in an initially smooth, spherically\nsymmetric, accretion flow, grow first linearly and then non-linearly.\nConsequently, an initially one-phase flow relatively quickly transitions into a\ntwo-phase/cold-hot accretion flow. For L_X = 0.015 L_{Edd} or higher, the cold\nclouds continue to accrete but in some regions of the hot phase, the gas starts\nto move outward. For L_X < 0.015 L_{Edd}, the cold phase contribution to the\ntotal mass accretion rate only moderately dominates over the hot phase\ncontribution. This result might have some consequences for cosmological\nsimulations of the so-called AGN feedback problem. Our simulations confirm the\nprevious results of Barai et al. (2012) who used smoothed particle hydrodynamic\nsimulations to tackle the same problem. However here, because we use a grid\nbased code to solve equations in 1-D and 2-D, we are able to follow the gas\ndynamics at much higher spacial resolution and for longer time in comparison to\nthe 3-D SPH simulations. One of new features revealed by our simulations is\nthat the cold condensations in the accretion flow initially form long\nfilaments, but at the later times, those filaments may break into smaller\nclouds advected outwards within the hot outflow.

The interpretation of experimental EDM\nlimits requires careful delineation of physics at a wide range of distance\nscales, from the long-range atomic and molecular scales to the short-distance\ndynamics of physics at or beyond the Fermi scale. In this review, we provide a\nframework for disentangling contributions from physics at these disparate\nscales, building out from the set of dimension four and six effective operators\nthat embody CP violation at the Fermi scale. We survey existing computations of\nhadronic and nuclear matrix elements associated with Fermi-scale CP violation\nin systems of experimental interest, and quantify the present level of\ntheoretical uncertainty in these calculations. Using representative BSM\nscenarios of current interest, we illustrate how the interplay of physics at\nvarious scales generates EDMs at a potentially observable level.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Mar 2013 20:36:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

We study the properties of stars\nthat rotate near their critical-rotation rate and investigate the properties of\nthe disks formed by equatorial mass ejections. We used the most recent Geneva\nstellar evolutionary tracks for rapidly rotating stars that reach the critical\nlimit and used a simple model for the disk structure. We obtain that for a 9\nMsun star at solar metallicity, the minimum average velocity during the Main\nSequence phase to reach the critical velocity is around 330 km/s, whereas it\nwould be 390 km/s at the metallicity of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). Red\ngiants or supergiants originating from very rapid rotators rotate six times\nfaster and show N/C ratios three times higher than those originating from\nslowly rotating stars. This difference becomes stronger at lower metallicity.\nIt might therefore be very interesting to study the red giants in clusters that\nshow a large number of Be stars on the MS band. On the basis of our single-star\nmodels, we show that the observed Be-star fraction with cluster age is\ncompatible with the existence of a temperature-dependent lower limit in the\nvelocity rate required for a star to become a Be star. The mass, extension, and\ndiffusion time of the disks produced when the star is losing mass at the\ncritical velocity, obtained from simple parametrized expressions, are not too\nfar from those estimated for disks around Be-type stars. At a given\nmetallicity, the mass and the extension of the disk increase with the initial\nmass and with age on the MS phase. Denser disks are expected in low-metallicity\nregions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Mar 2013 23:16:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

The 11-25 A broadband is described with a simple\nabsorption model that takes into account the pileup effect and results in an\nestimate of the hydrogen column density. The oxygen K-edge region (21-25 A) is\nfitted with the physical warmabs model, which is based on a photoionization\nmodel grid generated with the xstar code with the most up-to-date atomic\ndatabase. This approach allows a benchmark of the atomic data which involves\nwavelength shifts of both the K lines and photoionization cross sections in\norder to fit the observed spectra accurately. As a result we obtain: a column\ndensity of N(H)=1.38+/-0.01\\times 10^21 cm^-2; ionization parameter of\nlog(xi)=-2.70+/-0.023; oxygen abundance of A(O)= 0.689^{+0.015}_{-0.010}; and\nionization fractions of OI/O = 0.911, OII/O = 0.077, and OIII/O = 0.012 that\nare in good agreement with previous studies.

Mira and R\nAquarii (R Aqr) are two known binaries included in the program. The 47 LPVs are\namong 121 sources of the Australia Telescope National Facility (ATNF) Mopra\ntelescope's monitoring program.

The SiO spectra are from the\nv=1, J=1-0 (43.122 GHz; hereafter J10) and the v=1, J=2-1 (86.2434 GHz;\nhereafter J21) transitions. For 41 of the 47 LPVs we observed both transitions\nnearly simultaneously in 457 observations. We have determined and compared the\nvelocity centroids (VCs) and velocity ranges of emission (VRs) suffixed as\nabove (10 and 21) for the two transitions - VC10, VC21, VR10, and VR21.

Alternative splice variants increase the false\npositive rate of mapping while incomplete reference tran- scriptomes decrease\nthe true positive rate, leading to inaccurate transcript expression levels.\nGrouping transcripts by gene or read sharing (similar to mapping to a reference\ngenome) significantly decreases false positives, but only by improving the\nreference transcriptome itself can the missing transcript problem be addressed.\nWe also demonstrate that employing different mapping software does not yield\nsubstantial increases in accuracy on simulated data. Finally, we show that read\nlengths or insert sizes must increase past 1kb to resolve mapping ambiguity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Mar 2013 02:32:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-12"}

When those vertices are further required to induce a\nconnected subgraph, the corresponding number is called the connected vertex\ncover number, and is always greater or equal to the vertex cover number.\n  Connected vertex covers are found in many applications, and the relationship\nbetween those two graph invariants is therefore a natural question to\ninvestigate. For that purpose, we introduce the {\\em Price of Connectivity},\ndefined as the ratio between the two vertex cover numbers. We prove that the\nprice of connectivity is at most 2 for arbitrary graphs. We further consider\ngraph classes in which the price of connectivity of every induced subgraph is\nbounded by some real number $t$. We obtain forbidden induced subgraph\ncharacterizations for every real value $t \\leq 3/2$.\n  We also investigate critical graphs for this property, namely, graphs whose\nprice of connectivity is strictly greater than that of any proper induced\nsubgraph. Those are the only graphs that can appear in a forbidden subgraph\ncharacterization for the hereditary property of having a price of connectivity\nat most $t$. In particular, we completely characterize the critical graphs that\nare also chordal.\n  Finally, we also consider the question of computing the price of connectivity\nof a given graph. Unsurprisingly, the decision version of this question is\nNP-hard. In fact, we show that it is even complete for the class $\\Theta_2^P =\nP^{NP[\\log]}$, the class of decision problems that can be solved in polynomial\ntime, provided we can make $O(\\log n)$ queries to an NP-oracle.

Recently,\nsome proposals have appeared in the literature using codes with denser\nparity-check matrices, named moderate-density parity-check (MDPC) codes.\nHowever, the density of the parity-check matrices to be used in QC-LDPC\ncode-based variants of the McEliece cryptosystem has never been optimized. This\npaper aims at filling such gap, by proposing a procedure for selecting the\ndensity of the private parity-check matrix, based on the security level and the\ndecryption complexity. We provide some examples of the system parameters\nobtained through the proposed technique.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Mar 2013 15:16:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-15"}

Moreover, in an energy-constraint\nwireless network such as Wireless Sensor Network (a typical type of wireless ad\nhoc network), applying network coding to reduce the number of wireless\ntransmissions can also prolong the life time of sensor nodes. Although applying\nnetwork coding in a wireless sensor network is obviously beneficial, due to the\noperation that one transmitting information is actually combination of multiple\nother information, it is possible that an error propagation may occur in the\nnetwork. This special characteristic also exposes network coding system to a\nwide range of error attacks, especially Byzantine attacks. When some adversary\nnodes generate error data in the network with network coding, those erroneous\ninformation will be mixed at intermeidate nodes and thus corrupt all the\ninformation reaching a destination. Recent research efforts have shown that\nnetwork coding can be combined with classical error control codes and\ncryptography for secure communication or misbehavior detection. Nevertheless,\nwhen it comes to Byzantine attacks, these results have limited effect. In fact,\nunless we find out those adversary nodes and isolate them, network coding may\nperform much worse than pure routing in the presence of malicious nodes. In\nthis paper, a distributed hierarchical algorithm based on random linear network\ncoding is developed to detect, locate and isolate malicious nodes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Mar 2013 15:50:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-12"}
