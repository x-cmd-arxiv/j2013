Each agent wishes to be matched to an agent in the\nother set and has a strict preference over these potential matches. A matching\nis stable if there are no blocking pairs, i.e., no pair of agents that prefer\neach other to their assigned matches. Such a situation is undesirable as it\ncould lead to a deviation in which the blocking pair form a private arrangement\noutside the matching. This however assumes that the blocking pair have social\nties or communication channels to facilitate the deviation. Relaxing the\nstability definition to take account of the potential lack of social ties\nbetween agents can yield larger stable matchings.\n  In this paper, we define the Hospitals/Residents problem under Social\nStability (HRSS) which takes into account social ties between agents by\nintroducing a social network graph to the HR problem. Edges in the social\nnetwork graph correspond to resident-hospital pairs in the HR instance that\nknow one another. Pairs that do not have corresponding edges in the social\nnetwork graph can belong to a matching M but they can never block M. Relative\nto a relaxed stability definition for HRSS, called social stability, we show\nthat socially stable matchings can have different sizes and the problem of\nfinding a maximum socially stable matching is NP-hard, though approximable\nwithin 3/2. Furthermore we give polynomial time algorithms for three special\ncases of the problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Mar 2013 16:18:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 3 May 2013 15:59:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 13 May 2013 12:39:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-14"}

An emergent trend\nconsists in parsing proteins three-dimensional (3D) structures into graphs of\namino acids. Hence, the search of recurrent spatial motifs is formulated as a\nprocess of frequent subgraph discovery where each subgraph represents a spatial\nmotif. In this scope, several efficient approaches for frequent subgraph\ndiscovery have been proposed in the literature. However, the set of discovered\nfrequent subgraphs is too large to be efficiently analyzed and explored in any\nfurther process. In this paper, we propose a novel pattern selection approach\nthat shrinks the large number of discovered frequent subgraphs by selecting the\nrepresentative ones.

Yet, in our approach we incorporate the evolutionary\ninformation of amino acids defined in the substitution matrices in order to\nselect the representative subgraphs.

It is typically measured\nusing the ratio of the radial-to-tangential velocity dispersions at a given\ndistance from the halo centre. However, this measure is insufficient to\ndescribe the dynamics of realistic haloes, which are typically quite elongated.\nStudying the velocity distribution in massive DM haloes in cosmological\nsimulations, we find that in the inner parts of the haloes the local velocity\nellipsoids are strongly aligned with the major axis of the halo, the alignment\nbeing stronger for more relaxed haloes. In the outer regions of the haloes, the\nalignment becomes gradually weaker and the orientation is more random. These\ntwo distinct regions of different degree of the alignment coincide with two\ncharacteristic regimes of the DM density profile: shallower and steeper than\n\\rho r^{-2}. This alignment of the local velocity ellipsoids requires\nreinterpretation of features found in measurements based on the spherically\naveraged ratio of the radial-to-tangential velocity dispersions. In particular,\nwe show that the velocity distribution in the central halo regions is highly\nanisotropic. For cluster-size haloes with mass 10^{14}-10^{15} h^-1 Msun, the\nvelocity anisotropy along the major axis is nearly independent of radius and is\nequal to \\beta=1-\\sigma^2_{perp}/\\sigma^2_{radial}=0.4, which is significantly\nlarger than the previously estimated spherically averaged velocity anisotropy.\nThe alignment of density and velocity anisotropies, and the radial trends may\nalso have some implications for the mass modelling based on kinematical data of\nsuch objects as galaxy clusters or dwarf spheroidals, where the orbital\nanisotropy is a key element in an unbiased mass inference.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Mar 2013 17:09:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 21 Jun 2013 10:18:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

The standard model of an average\neconomic agent predicts that fluctuations are reduced by such an adaptive\npricing mechanism.\n  However, the underlying assumption that the actions of all agents average out\non the time axis is not always true in a market of many agents. We numerically\nstudy an econophysics agent model of an adaptive power market that does not\nassume averaging a priori. We find that when agents are exposed to source noise\nvia correlated price fluctuations (as adaptive pricing schemes suggest), the\nmarket may amplify those fluctuations. In particular, small price changes may\ntranslate to large load fluctuations through catastrophic consumer\nsynchronization. As a result, an adaptive power market may cause the opposite\neffect than intended: Power fluctuations are not dampened but amplified\ninstead.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Mar 2013 20:53:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-29"}

From the N$_2$H$^+$ emission, we identify 19 dense cores,\nsome starless and some protostellar.

In this\nspace, the C$^{18}$O components appear as velocity-coherent structures, and we\nhave identified them automatically using a dedicated algorithm (FIVe: Friends\nIn Velocity). Using this algorithm, we have identified 35 filamentary\ncomponents with typical lengths of 0.5 pc, sonic internal velocity dispersions,\nand mass-per-unit-length close to the stability threshold of isothermal\ncylinders at 10 K. Core formation seems to have occurred inside the filamentary\ncomponents via fragmentation, with a small number of fertile components with\nlarger mass-per-unit-length being responsible for most cores in the cloud.

First we study\nthe dependencies of the stability behaviors of various patterns, as well as\ntransition time scales, on parameters relevant to the switching action(the\ndegree of built-in azimuthal anisotropy in the system and the switching beam\nintensity). It is found that if the parameters are varied, the pattern system\nundergoes abrupt transitions at threshold parameter values which are\naccompanied by multiple-stability and hysteresis behaviors. Moreover, during a\nreal-time switching action, the transient dynamics of the system may depend\nsignificantly on the proximity of unstable patterns. The second aspect is a\nclassification and detailed analysis of the polariton scattering processes\ncontributing to the pattern dynamics, giving us an understanding of the\nselection and control of patterns as results of these processes' intricate\ninterplay. The crucial role played by the relative phases of the polariton\nfield in determining the gains or losses of polariton densities in various\nmomentum modes is highlighted, and interpretation of the actions of the various\nprocesses in terms of concepts commonly used in classical pattern-forming\nsystems is given.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Mar 2013 23:43:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

We then find that the MIR CF shows the strongest\ncorrelation with Lwing/L_{bol} rather than with Lcore/L_{bol} or the above\nfundamental AGN parameters, and the correlation becomes stronger as the\ninfrared wavelength increases.

A key unsolved\nquestion is whether the IMF is universal in time and space. Here we use\nstate-of-the-art results of stellar evolution to show that the IMF of our\nGalaxy made a transition from an IMF dominated by massive stars to the\npresent-day IMF at an early phase of the Galaxy formation. Updated results from\nstellar evolution in a wide range of metallicities have been implemented in a\nbinary population synthesis code, and compared with the observations of\ncarbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars in our Galaxy. We find that applying\nthe present-day IMF to Galactic halo stars causes serious contradictions with\nfour observable quantities connected with the evolution of AGB stars.\nFurthermore, a comparison between our calculations and the observations of CEMP\nstars may help us to constrain the transition metallicity for the IMF which we\ntentatively set at [Fe/H] = -2. A novelty of the current study is the inclusion\nof mass loss suppression in intermediate-mass AGB stars at low-metallicity.\nThis significantly reduces the overproduction of nitrogen-enhanced stars that\nwas a major problem in using the high-mass star dominated IMF in previous\nstudies. Our results also demonstrate that the use of the present day IMF for\nall time in chemical evolution models results in the overproduction of Type I.5\nsupernovae.

Here, we present a detailed numerical study of the energy\ninjection process and interpret the X-ray and optical afterglow light curves of\nGRB 081029. In our model, we have assumed two periods of energy injection, each\nwith a constant injection power.

In X-ray band, the predicted amplitude of the\nrebrightening is much shallower, which is also consistent with the observed\nX-ray afterglow light curve.

The Bethe approximation is an\nefficient approximation for graphical models, which gives an asymptotically\naccurate estimate of the partition function for many graphical models. The\nBethe approximation explains the well-known message passing algorithm, belief\npropagation, which is exact for tree graphical models. It is also known that\nthe cluster variational method gives the generalized Bethe approximation,\ncalled the Kikuchi approximation, yielding the generalized belief propagation.\nIn the thesis, a new series of generalization of the Bethe approximation is\nproposed, which is named the asymptotic Bethe approximation. The asymptotic\nBethe approximation is derived from the characterization of the Bethe free\nenergy using graph covers, which was recently obtained by Vontobel. The\nasymptotic Bethe approximation can be expressed in terms of the edge zeta\nfunction by using Watanabe and Fukumizu's result about the Hessian of the Bethe\nentropy. The asymptotic Bethe approximation is confirmed to be better than the\nconventional Bethe approximation on some conditions. For this purpose, Chertkov\nand Chernyak's loop calculus formula is employed, which shows that the error of\nthe Bethe approximation can be expressed as a sum of weights corresponding to\ngeneralized loops, and generalized for non-binary finite alphabets by using\nconcepts of information geometry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Mar 2013 05:13:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-12"}

In mammals, gBGC is\nhypothesized to contribute to variation in GC content, rapidly evolving\nsequences, and the fixation of deleterious mutations, but its prevalence and\ngeneral functional consequences remain poorly understood. gBGC is difficult to\nincorporate into models of molecular evolution and so far has primarily been\nstudied using summary statistics from genomic comparisons. Here, we introduce a\nnew probabilistic model that captures the joint effects of natural selection\nand gBGC on nucleotide substitution patterns, while allowing for correlations\nalong the genome in these effects. We implemented our model in a computer\nprogram, called phastBias, that can accurately detect gBGC tracts ~1 kilobase\nor longer in simulated sequence alignments. When applied to real primate genome\nsequences, phastBias predicts gBGC tracts that cover roughly 0.3% of the human\nand chimpanzee genomes and account for 1.2% of human-chimpanzee nucleotide\ndifferences. These tracts fall in clusters, particularly in subtelomeric\nregions; they are enriched for recombination hotspots and fast-evolving\nsequences; and they display an ongoing fixation preference for G and C alleles.\nWe also find some evidence that they contribute to the fixation of deleterious\nalleles, including an enrichment for disease-associated polymorphisms. These\ntracts provide a unique window into historical recombination processes along\nthe human and chimpanzee lineages; they supply additional evidence of long-term\nconservation of megabase-scale recombination rates accompanied by rapid\nturnover of hotspots. Together, these findings shed new light on the\nevolutionary, functional, and disease implications of gBGC.

In particular, using GPUs for general purpose\ncomputing has brought forth several success stories with respect to time taken,\ncost, power, and other metrics. However, accelerator based computing has\nsignifi- cantly relegated the role of CPUs in computation. As CPUs evolve and\nalso offer matching computational resources, it is important to also include\nCPUs in the computation. We call this the hybrid computing model. Indeed, most\ncomputer systems of the present age offer a degree of heterogeneity and\ntherefore such a model is quite natural.\n  We reevaluate the claim of a recent paper by Lee et al.(ISCA 2010). We argue\nthat the right question arising out of Lee et al. (ISCA 2010) should be how to\nuse a CPU+GPU platform efficiently, instead of whether one should use a CPU or\na GPU exclusively. To this end, we experiment with a set of 13 diverse\nworkloads ranging from databases, image processing, sparse matrix kernels, and\ngraphs. We experiment with two different hybrid platforms: one consisting of a\n6-core Intel i7-980X CPU and an NVidia Tesla T10 GPU, and another consisting of\nan Intel E7400 dual core CPU with an NVidia GT520 GPU. On both these platforms,\nwe show that hybrid solutions offer good advantage over CPU or GPU alone\nsolutions. On both these platforms, we also show that our solutions are 90%\nresource efficient on average.\n  Our work therefore suggests that hybrid computing can offer tremendous\nadvantages at not only research-scale platforms but also the more realistic\nscale systems with significant performance gains and resource efficiency to the\nlarge scale user community.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Mar 2013 05:35:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-12"}

Firstly, the interevent time series of rating\nbehaviors of these three type medias show the similar scaling property with\nexponents ranging from 0.53 to 0.58, which implies that the collective\nbehaviors of rating media follow a process embodying self-similarity and\nlong-range correlation.

The method\nexploits the notion of widely linear estimation to model the input-out relation\nfor complex-valued data and considers two cases: a) the complex data are split\ninto their real and imaginary parts and a typical real kernel is employed to\nmap the complex data to a complexified feature space and b) a pure complex\nkernel is used to directly map the data to the induced complex feature space.\nThe recently developed Wirtinger's calculus on complex reproducing kernel\nHilbert spaces (RKHS) is employed in order to compute the Lagrangian and derive\nthe dual optimization problem. As one of our major results, we prove that any\ncomplex SVM/SVR task is equivalent with solving two real SVM/SVR tasks\nexploiting a specific real kernel which is generated by the chosen complex\nkernel. In particular, the case of pure complex kernels leads to the generation\nof new kernels, which have not been considered before. In the classification\ncase, the proposed framework inherently splits the complex space into four\nparts. This leads naturally in solving the four class-task (quaternary\nclassification), instead of the typical two classes of the real SVM. In turn,\nthis rationale can be used in a multiclass problem as a split-class scenario\nbased on four classes, as opposed to the one-versus-all method; this can lead\nto significant computational savings.

To explore the role of eta', I used EXODUS\nsimulations to generate different dilepton spectra, corresponding to different\neta' properties. The conclusion here was that the excess can not be described\nwith just the eta' mass modification, but the agreement with data has been\nimproved significantly.\n  Another idea which might brings us closer to understand the excess is to\nexamine the radial flow of the mesons, which was not included in the original\nPHENIX analysis. Radial flow is important in the low-pT range, where it\ndescribes the particles' spectra well: just in the region where the dilepton\nspectrum has the most contributions from.

Inspired by Core Erlang, we\nintroduce Lambda-Actor, a prototypical functional language with\npattern-matching algebraic data types, augmented with process creation and\nasynchronous message-passing primitives. We formalise an abstract model of\nLambda-Actor programs called Actor Communicating System (ACS) which has a\nnatural interpretation as a vector addition system, for which some verification\nproblems are decidable. We give a parametric abstract interpretation framework\nfor Lambda-Actor and use it to build a polytime computable, flow-based,\nabstract semantics of Lambda-Actor programs, which we then use to bootstrap the\nACS construction, thus deriving a more accurate abstract model of the input\nprogram. We have constructed Soter, a tool implementation of the verification\nmethod, thereby obtaining the first fully-automatic, infinite-state model\nchecker for a core fragment of Erlang. We find that in practice our abstraction\ntechnique is accurate enough to verify an interesting range of safety\nproperties. Though the ACS coverability problem is Expspace-complete, Soter can\nanalyse these verification problems surprisingly efficiently.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Mar 2013 12:10:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-11"}

The mass tracks on\nthese J-maps correspond to the sheath region between the CME and its associated\nshock front as detected by in situ measurements at L1. A time-series of mass\nmeasurements from the STEREO COR-2A instrument are made along the Earth\npropagation direction.
