The existence depends on the $L^2$-Betti numbers of $\\Gamma$, its\nsubgroups and of a uniform lattice of $\\Isom(X)$.

The cover data that is transmitted through the internet hides the\nwatermark in a computer aided assertion method such that it becomes\nundetectable. Finally it stands as a hindrance over many operations without\nharming the embedded host document. Unfortunately, many owners of the digital\nmaterials such as images, text, audio and video are reluctant to the spreading\nof their documents on the web or other networked environment, because the ease\nof duplicating digital materials facilitates copyright violation. Digital media\ndistribution occurs through various channels. The cover data may or may not\nhold any relation with the watermark information.

The answer to this question is important, since some published\nnumerical studies use the time difference quotients, whereas other numerical\nstudies do not. The criterion used in this paper to answer this question is the\nrate of convergence of the error of the reduced order model with respect to the\nnumber of proper orthogonal decomposition basis functions. Two cases are\nconsidered: the no_DQ case, in which the snapshot difference quotients are not\nused, and the DQ case, in which the snapshot difference quotients are used. The\nerror estimates suggest that the convergence rates in the $C^0(L^2)$-norm and\nin the $C^0(H^1)$-norm are optimal for the DQ case, but suboptimal for the\nno_DQ case. The convergence rates in the $L^2(H^1)$-norm are optimal for both\nthe DQ case and the no_DQ case. Numerical tests are conducted on the heat\nequation and on the Burgers equation. The numerical results support the\nconclusions drawn from the theoretical error estimates.

The inhomogeneities in the energy density of such\nfields are quadratic in the fields to leading order in the inhomogeneity\nexpansion. Although it is often assumed that such isocurvature perturbations\nand inflaton-driven curvature perturbations are uncorre- lated, this is not\nobvious from a direct computational point of view due to the form of the\nminimal gravitational interactions. We thus compute the irreducible\ngravitational contributions to the quadratic isocurvature-curvature\ncross-correlation. We find a small but non-decaying cross-correlation, which in\nprinciple serves as a consistency prediction of this large class of\nisocurvature perturbations. We apply our cross-correlation result to two dark\nmatter isocurvature perturbation scenarios: QCD axions and WIMPZILLAs. On the\ntechnical side, we utilize a gravita- tional Ward identity in a novel manner to\ndemonstrate the gauge invariance of the computation. Furthermore, the detailed\ncomputation is interpreted in terms of a soft-{\\zeta} theorem and a\ngravitational Ward identity. Finally, we also identify explicitly all the\ncounterterms that are necessary for renormalizing the isocurvature perturbation\ncomposite operator in inflationary cosmological backgrounds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Mar 2013 04:06:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-28"}

Recent results found the optimal trafficstorage tradeoff, and proposed\nregenerating codes to achieve the optimality. We aim at minimizing the\ntransmission cost in the repair process. We consider the network topology in\nthe repair, and accordingly modify information flow graphs.

Previously, it has been assumed that the orbits in\ngiant planet systems become gravitationally unstable after the gas nebula\ndispersal. It was not well understood, however, how these unstable conditions\nwere established in the first place.\n  In this work we numerically simulate the evolution of systems of three\nplanets as the planets sequentially grow to Jupiter's mass, and dynamically\ninteract among themselves and with the gas disk. We use the hydro-dynamical\ncode FARGO that we modified by implementing the $N$-body integrator SyMBA. The\nnew code can handle close encounters and collisions between planets. To test\ntheir stability, the planetary systems were followed with SyMBA for up to\n$10^8$ yr after the gas disk dispersal.\n  We find that dynamics of the growing planets is complex, because migration\nand resonances raise their orbital eccentricities, and cause dynamical\ninstabilities when gas is still around. If the dynamical instabilities occur\nearly, planets can be removed by collisions and ejections, and the system\nrearranges into a new, more stable configuration. In this case, the planetary\nsystems emerging from the gas disks are expected to be stable, and would need\nto be destabilized by other means (low-mass planets, planetesimal disks, etc.).\nAlternatively, for the giant planet system to be intrinsically unstable upon\nthe gas disk dispersal, a special timing would be required with the growth of\n(at least some of) the giant planets having to occur near the end of the gas\ndisk lifetime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Mar 2013 09:46:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

Nonetheless, there are many challenging problems arising in\ntraining cascade detectors. One common issue is that the node classifier is\ntrained with a symmetric classifier. Having a low misclassification error rate\ndoes not guarantee an optimal node learning goal in cascade classifiers, i.e.,\nan extremely high detection rate with a moderate false positive rate. In this\nwork, we present a new approach to train an effective node classifier in a\ncascade detector. The algorithm is based on two key observations: 1) Redundant\nweak classifiers can be safely discarded; 2) The final detector should satisfy\nthe asymmetric learning objective of the cascade architecture. To achieve this,\nwe separate the classifier training into two steps: finding a pool of\ndiscriminative weak classifiers/features and training the final classifier by\npruning weak classifiers which contribute little to the asymmetric learning\ncriterion (asymmetric classifier construction). Our model reduction approach\nhelps accelerate the learning time while achieving the pre-determined learning\nobjective.

In this\nset-up convex constraint sets are distributed to the network processors who\nhave to compute the optimizer of a linear cost function subject to the\nconstraints. We propose a novel fully distributed algorithm, named\ncutting-plane consensus, to solve the problem, based on an outer polyhedral\napproximation of the constraint sets. Processors running the algorithm compute\nand exchange linear approximations of their locally feasible sets.\nIndependently of the number of processors in the network, each processor stores\nonly a small number of linear constraints, making the algorithm scalable to\nlarge networks. The cutting-plane consensus algorithm is presented and analyzed\nfor the general framework. Specifically, we prove that all processors running\nthe algorithm agree on an optimizer of the global problem, and that the\nalgorithm is tolerant to node and link failures as long as network connectivity\nis preserved. Then, the cutting plane consensus algorithm is specified to three\ndifferent classes of distributed optimization problems, namely (i) inequality\nconstrained problems, (ii) robust optimization problems, and (iii) almost\nseparable optimization problems with separable objective functions and coupling\nconstraints. For each one of these problem classes we solve a concrete problem\nthat can be expressed in that framework and present computational results. That\nis, we show how to solve: position estimation in wireless sensor networks, a\ndistributed robust linear program and, a distributed microgrid control problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Mar 2013 11:25:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-02"}

By means of mean-field theory,\nMonte Carlo simulations, and finite-size scaling analysis we determine the\ncritical Casimir force acting on the two parallel walls and its corresponding\nuniversal scaling function. We show that in the limit of stripe widths small\ncompared with the film thickness, on the striped surface the system effectively\nrealizes Dirichlet boundary conditions, which generically do not hold for\nactual fluids. Moreover, the critical Casimir force is found to be attractive\nor repulsive, depending on the width of the stripes of the chemically patterned\nsurface and on the boundary condition applied to the opposing surface.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Mar 2013 11:58:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 Nov 2013 16:35:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-27"}

The first regime is cooling of the ceramic to 77 K\nin the excitation field with a subsequent turning off of the excitation field,\nand the second regime is cooling in the Earth's magnetic field with a\nsubsequent turning on and off of the excitation field. At an excitation field\nup to 2000 A/m in these regimes two different types of macroscopic current\nvortex structures, which generate the frozen field, are formed. The local\ncritical field of excitation when the vortex structure is formed in the second\nregime exceeds the uniform perpendicular critical field of the slab by a factor\nof 10 and equals 1700 A/m.

The\nanomalies, observed in the data of recent experiments (possible bump in the\nelectron spectrum and the PAMELA anomaly in the positron fraction) are\ndiscussed through the systematic use of simple analytical solutions of the\ntransport equations for cosmic ray electrons. Three main ways of explaining the\norigin of the anomalies are considered: the conservative way supposing the\npositrons to be pure secondary particles; the nearby sources like pulsars\norigin; and the dark matter origin. This review discusses, also, the inability\nto select the pulsars model or the dark matter model to explain the electron\nanomalies on the basis of the electron spectra with the usual large energy\nbinning ($\\gtrsim15%$). It is argued that the signature of nearby pulsars\norigin of the anomalies against the dark matter origin could be the fine\nstructure of the cosmic ray electron spectrum predicted in the Malyshev et al.\npaper (2009) and which was observed in the data from the high-resolution ATIC\nexperiment (2009-2011).

However,\nsome of these studies exhibit methodological problems, or were based on coarse\nassumptions (such as a strict periodicity of the solar orbit). Here we\ninvestigate this link in more detail, using a model of the Galaxy to\nreconstruct the solar orbit and thus a predictive model of the temporal\nvariation of the extinction rate due to astronomical mechanisms. We compare\nthese predictions as well as those of various reference models with\npaleontological data. Our approach involves Bayesian model comparison, which\ntakes into account the uncertainties in the paleontological data as well as the\ndistribution of solar orbits consistent with the uncertainties in the\nastronomical data. We find that various versions of the orbital model are not\nfavored beyond simpler reference models. In particular, the distribution of\nmass extinction events can be explained just as well by a uniform random\ndistribution as by any other model tested. Although our negative results on the\norbital model are robust to changes in the Galaxy model, the Sun's coordinates\nand the errors in the data, we also find that it would be very difficult to\npositively identify the orbital model even if it were the true one.

We show that phonon spectroscopy with STJs offers a spectral\nresolution of ~15-20 GHz, which is ~20 times better than thermal conductance\nmeasurements, for probing nanoscale phonon transport. The STJs are Al-AlxOy-Al\ntunnel junctions and phonon emission and detection occurs via quasiparticle\nexcitation and decay transitions that occur in the superconducting films.

In this work we aim at determining the\ncharacteristics of the fast MHD sausage mode in the corona on the modulation of\nobservable quantities such as line intensity and spectral line broadening.\nEffects of line-of-sight angle, and spatial, temporal and spectral resolutions\nare considered.

For two of these sources (PKS\n0208-512 and PKS 0528+134), there were extensive observations (at various\nobserving periods) by EGRET. Hence these dramatic variations are not due to a\nsingle short time-scale flare, but reflect long term changes in the average\nflux. Over the last twenty years, these two sources were also the target of\nseveral X-ray observatories (e.g. ROSAT, ASCA, RXTE, BeppoSAX, Chandra, Suzaku,\nXMM-Newton and Swift). While the ratios of the average gamma-ray fluxes between\nEGRET and Fermi observations are 22.9 +/- 1.9 and 12.6 +/- 1.5, their estimated\n2-10 keV X-ray flux do not show such dramatic variations. The X-ray emission\nfrom such flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) are believed to be due to\nsynchrotron self Compton, while gamma-rays originate from inverse\nComptonization of external soft photons from an accretion disk and/or broad\nline region. We argue that in this scenario, the only explanation for the\nuncorrelated variability is that there was an order of magnitude decrease in\nthe external soft photons, while the jet parameters remained more or less\nconstant.

We\npresent deep velocity-resolved Herschel-HIFI spectra of the 3(12)-3(03) lines\nof H2-16O and H2-18O (1097 GHz, Eup/k = 249 K) in the low-mass Class 0\nprotostar NGC1333 IRAS2A. A spherical radiative transfer model with a power-law\ndensity profile is unable to reproduce both the HIFI data and existing\ninterferometric data on the H2-18O 3(13)-2(20) line (203 GHz, Eup/k = 204 K).\nInstead, the HIFI spectra likely show optically thick emission from a hot core\nwith a radius of about 100 AU. The mass of the hot core is estimated from the\nC18O J=9-8 and 10-9 lines. We derive a lower limit to the hot water abundance\nof 2x10^-5, consistent with the theoretical predictions of ~10^-4. The revised\nHDO/H2O abundance ratio is 1x10^-3, an order of magnitude lower than previously\nestimated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Mar 2013 15:46:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

One believes usually in gauge models and we also do it. Nevertheless, it\nis an interesting idea to develop the class of ${\\rm\nGL}(4,\\mathbb{R})$-invariant (or rather ${\\rm GL}(n,\\mathbb{R})$-invariant)\ntetrad ($n$-leg) generally covariant models. This is done below and motivated\nby our idea of bringing back to life the Thales of Miletus idea of affine\nsymmetry. Formally, the obtained scheme is a generally-covariant tetrad\n($n$-leg) model, but it turns out that generally-covariant and intrinsically\naffinely-invariant models must have a kind of non-accidental Born-Infeld-like\nstructure. Let us also mention that they, being based on tetrads ($n$-legs),\nhave many features common with continuous defect theories. It is interesting\nthat they possess some group-theoretical solutions and more general\nspherically-symmetric solutions. It is also interesting that within such\nframework the normal-hyperbolic signature of the space-time metric is not\nintroduced by hand, but appears as a kind of solution, rather integration\nconstants, of differential equations. Let us mention that our Born-Infeld\nscheme is more general than alternative tetrad models. It may be also used\nwithin more general schemes, including also the gauge ones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Mar 2013 13:05:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 Feb 2016 11:29:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-18"}
