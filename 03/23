As a\nconsequence, the detection of correlation functions between an arbitrary set of\nlattice sites is possible.

Given an observation $y$, it\nsearches for a state of hidden variables $x$ that maximizes $p(x,y \\mid\n\\theta)$ by coordinate ascent on parameters $\\theta$ and $x$. In this paper we\nintroduce VT to PRISM, a logic-based probabilistic modeling system for\ngenerative models. VT improves PRISM in three ways. First VT in PRISM converges\nfaster than EM in PRISM due to the VT's termination condition. Second,\nparameters learned by VT often show good prediction performance compared to\nthose learned by EM. We conducted two parsing experiments with probabilistic\ngrammars while learning parameters by a variety of inference methods, i.e.\\ VT,\nEM, MAP and VB. The result is that VT achieved the best parsing accuracy among\nthem in both experiments. Also we conducted a similar experiment for\nclassification tasks where a hidden variable is not a prediction target unlike\nprobabilistic grammars. We found that in such a case VT does not necessarily\nyield superior performance. Third since VT always deals with a single\nprobability of a single explanation, Viterbi explanation, the exclusiveness\ncondition that is imposed on PRISM programs is no more required if we learn\nparameters by VT.\n  Last but not least we can say that as VT in PRISM is general and applicable\nto any PRISM program, it largely reduces the need for the user to develop a\nspecific VT algorithm for a specific model.

For dealing with the problem that\ngenetic algorithm are hardly applied to community detection, we propose a\ngenetic algorithm with ensemble learning (GAEL) for detecting community\nstructure in complex networks. GAEL replaces its traditional crossover operator\nwith a multi-individual crossover operator based on ensemble learning.\nTherefore, GAEL can avoid the problems that are brought by traditional\ncrossover operator which is only able to mix string blocks of different\nindividuals, but not able to recombine clustering contexts of different\nindividuals into new better ones. In addition, the local search strategy, which\nmakes mutated node be placed into the community where most of its neighbors\nare, is used in mutation operator. At last, a Markov random walk based method\nis used to initialize population in this paper, and it can provide us a\npopulation of accurate and diverse clustering solutions. Those diverse and\naccurate individuals are suitable for ensemble learning based multi-individual\ncrossover operator. The proposed GAEL is tested on both computer-generated and\nreal-world networks, and compared with current representative algorithms for\ncommunity detection in complex networks. Experimental results demonstrate that\nGAEL is highly effective at discovering community structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Mar 2013 17:50:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-25"}

The subsequent\nradioactive decay of the nuclei can power electromagnetic emission similar to,\nbut significantly dimmer than, an ordinary supernova. Identifying such events\nis an important goal of future transient surveys, offering new perspectives on\nthe origin of r-process nuclei and the astrophysical sources of gravitational\nwaves. Predictions of the transient light curves and spectra, however, have\nsuffered from the uncertain optical properties of heavy ions. Here we consider\nthe opacity of expanding r-process material and argue that it is dominated by\nline transitions from those ions with the most complex valence electron\nstructure, namely the lanthanides. For a few representative ions, we run atomic\nstructure models to calculate radiative data for tens of millions of lines. We\nfind that the resulting r-process opacities are orders of magnitude larger than\nthat of ordinary (e.g., iron-rich) supernova ejecta. Radiative transport\ncalculations using these new opacities indicate that the transient emission\nshould be dimmer and redder than previously thought. The spectra appear\npseudo-blackbody, with broad absorption features, and peak in the infrared (~1\nmicron). We discuss uncertainties in the opacities and attempt to quantify\ntheir impact on the spectral predictions. The results have important\nimplications for observational strategies to find and study the radioactively\npowered electromagnetic counterparts to compact object mergers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Mar 2013 22:24:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

From the practical point of view, when trying\nto compute an optimal trajectory, for instance by means of a shooting method,\nchattering may be a serious obstacle to convergence.\n  In this paper we propose a general regularization procedure, by adding an\nappropriate penalization of the total variation.

The two\ndependent variables are a scaled energy deviation and a generalization of the\nso-called ponderomotive phase. As the wavelength varies the system passes\nthrough resonant and nonresonant (NR) zones and we develop NR and\nnear-to-resonant (NtoR) normal form approximations.

For some\nchemical reaction systems, more than two moments are necessary to describe the\ndynamic properties of the system, which the linear noise approximation (LNA) is\nunable to provide. Moreover, also for systems for which the mean does not have\na strong dependence on higher order moments, moment approximation methods give\ninformation about higher order moments of the underlying probability\ndistribution. We demonstrate the method using a dimerisation reaction,\nMichaelis-Menten kinetics and a model of an oscillating p53 system. We show\nthat for the dimerisation reaction and Michaelis-Menten enzyme kinetics system\nhigher order moments have limited influence on the estimation of the mean,\nwhile for the p53 system, the solution for the mean can require several moments\nto converge to the average obtained from many stochastic simulations.

This comparison gives insight into the analogies/differences in the\nphysics of the star-disk interaction and in the physical mechanisms driving\ndisk dissipation.\n  Several optical and near-IR line luminosities used for low-mass objects are\nalso valid to estimate typical accretion rates for intermediate-mass stars\nunder similar empirical expressions. In contrast, the Halpha width at 10% of\npeak intensity is used as an accretion tracer for T Tauris, but is not reliable\nto estimate accretion rates for Herbig Ae/Bes. This can be explained as a\nconsequence of the different stellar rotation rates that characterize both\ntypes of stars. In addition, there are similar trends when the accretion rate\nis related to the near-IR colours and disk masses, suggesting that viscous\naccretion disk models are able to explain these trends for both T Tauri and\nHerbig Ae/Be stars. However, there are two major differences between cool and\nhot PMS objects. First, the inner gas dissipation timescale, as estimated by\nrelating the accretion rates and the stellar ages, is slightly faster for\nHerbig Ae/Be stars. This could have implications on the physical mechanism able\nto form planets around objects more massive than the Sun. Second, the relative\nposition of Herbig Ae/Bes with disks showing signs of inner dust clearing in\nthe accretion rate--disk mass plane contrasts with that of transitional T Tauri\nstars, when both samples are compared with \"classical\", non-evolved disks. This\nlatter difference could be pointing to a different physical mechanism driving\ndisk evolution, depending on the stellar regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Mar 2013 14:54:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-26"}
