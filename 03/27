An interesting\nquestion is how resource allocation mechanisms can be tuned to improve RNC\nperformance. By means of a differential equation framework which models RNC\nthroughput in terms of lower layer parameters, we propose a gradient based\napproach that can dynamically allocate MAC and PHY layer resources with the\ngoal of maximizing the minimum network coding throughput among all the\ndestination nodes in a RNC multicast. We exemplify this general approach with\ntwo resource allocation problems: (i) power control to improve network coding\nthroughput, and (ii) CSMA mean backoff delay control to improve network coding\nthroughput. We design both centralized algorithms and online algorithms for\npower control and CSMA backoff control. Our evaluations, including numerically\nsolving the differential equations in the centralized algorithm and an\nevent-driven simulation for the online algorithm, show that such gradient based\ndynamic resource allocation yields significant throughput improvement of the\ndestination nodes in RNC. Further, our numerical results reveal that network\ncoding aware power control can regain the broadcast advantage of wireless\ntransmissions to improve the throughput.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Mar 2013 16:17:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-27"}

The use of zeolite membranes\nis a very efficient way in order to capture CO2 from some flue gases.

In\ntime delay gravitational lenses, \"external convergence,\" kappa, can dominate\nthe uncertainty in the inferred distances and hence cosmological parameters. In\nthis paper we attempt to reconstruct kappa, due to line of sight structure,\nusing a simple halo model. We use mock catalogues from the Millennium\nSimulation, and calibrate and compare our reconstructed P(kappa) to ray-traced\nkappa \"truth\" values; taking into account realistic observational\nuncertainties. We find that the reconstruction of kappa provides an improvement\nin precision of ~50% over galaxy number counts. We find that the lowest-kappa\nlines of sight have the best constrained P(kappa). In anticipation of large\nfuture samples of lenses, we find that selecting the third of the systems with\nthe highest precision kappa estimates gives a sample of unbiased time delay\ndistance measurements with just ~1% uncertainty due to line of sight external\nconvergence effects. Photometric data are sufficient to pre-select the\nbest-constrained lines of sight, and can be done before investment in\nlight-curve monitoring. Conversely, we show that selecting lines of sight with\nhigh external shear could, with the reconstruction model presented, induce\nbiases of up to 1% in time delay distance. We find that a major potential\nsource of systematic error is uncertainty in the high mass end of the stellar\nmass-halo mass relation; this could introduce ~2% biases on the time-delay\ndistance if completely ignored. We suggest areas for the improvement of this\ngeneral analysis framework (including more sophisticated treatment of high mass\nstructures) that should allow yet more accurate cosmological inferences to be\nmade.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Mar 2013 17:16:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

The distributions against which optimality is\nachieved are the so-called k-sine-skewed distributions of Umbach and\nJammalamadaka (2009). We first show that sequences of k-sine-skewed models are\nlocally and asymptotically normal in the vicinity of reflective symmetry.\nFollowing the Le Cam methodology, we then construct optimal (in the maximin\nsense) parametric tests for reflective symmetry, which we render\nsemi-parametric by a studentization argument. These asymptotically\ndistribution-free tests happen to be uniformly optimal (under any reference\ndensity) and are moreover of a very simple and intuitive form. They furthermore\nexhibit nice small sample properties, as we show through a Monte Carlo\nsimulation study. Our new tests also allow us to re-visit the famous red wood\nants data set of Jander (1957). We further show that one of the proposed\nparametric tests can as well serve as a test for uniformity against cardioid\nalternatives; this test coincides with the famous circular Rayleigh (1919) test\nfor uniformity which is thus proved to be (also) optimal against cardioid\nalternatives. Moreover, our choice of k-sine-skewed alternatives, which are the\ncircular analogues of the classical linear skew-symmetric distributions,\npermits us a Fisher singularity analysis \\`a la Hallin and Ley (2012) with the\nresult that only the prominent sine-skewed von Mises distribution suffers from\nthese inferential drawbacks.

Using 300,000 BOSS-Survey galaxies\nwith accurate spectroscopic redshifts, we measure their mean redshift depth\nbehind four large samples of optically selected clusters from the SDSS surveys,\ntotalling 5,000-15,000 clusters. A clear trend of increasing mean redshift\ntowards the cluster centers is found, averaged over each of the four cluster\nsamples. In addition we find similar but noisier behaviour for an independent\nX-ray sample of 158 clusters lying in the foreground of the current BOSS sky\narea. By adopting the mass-richness relationships appropriate for each survey\nwe compare our results with theoretical predictions for each of the four SDSS\ncluster catalogs. The radial form of this redshift enhancement is well fitted\nby a richness-to-mass weighted composite Navarro-Frenk-White profile with an\neffective mass ranging between M_200 ~ 1.4-1.8 10^14 M_sun for the optically\ndetected cluster samples, and M_200 ~ 5.0 10^14 M_sun for the X-ray sample.\nThis lensing detection helps to establish the credibility of these SDSS cluster\nsurveys, and provides a normalization for their respective mass-richness\nrelations. In the context of the upcoming bigBOSS, Subaru-PFS, and EUCLID-NISP\nspectroscopic surveys, this method represents an independent means of deriving\nthe masses of cluster samples for examining the cosmological evolution, and\nprovides a relatively clean consistency check of weak-lensing measurements,\nfree from the systematic limitations of shear calibration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Mar 2013 18:24:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

We\ndevelop an innovative combination of generic models of radiative transfer (RT)\nin dusty media with a prescription for the spectral evolution of galaxies, via\nthe association of different geometric components of galaxies with stars in\ndifferent age ranges. We show that a wide range of RT models all predict a\nquasi-universal relation between slope of the attenuation curve at any\nwavelength and V-band attenuation optical depth in the diffuse interstellar\nmedium (ISM), at all galaxy inclinations. This relation predicts steeper\n(shallower) dust attenuation curves than both the Calzetti and MW curves at\nsmall (large) attenuation optical depths, which implies that geometry and\norientation effects have a stronger influence on the shape of the attenuation\ncurve than changes in the optical properties of dust grains.

The mean spectral indices are 0.66 +/- 0.01 where\nthe jets first brighten abruptly and 0.59 +/- 0.01 after they recollimate. The\nmean change in spectral index between these locations, which is independent of\ncalibration and flux-density scale errors and is therefore more accurately and\nrobustly measured, is -0.067 +/- 0.006. Our jet models associate the decrease\nin spectral index with a bulk deceleration of the flow from 0.8c to <0.5c. We\nsuggest that the decrease is the result of a change in the characteristics of\nongoing particle acceleration. One possible acceleration mechanism is the\nfirst-order Fermi process in mildly relativistic shocks: in the Bohm limit, the\nindex of the electron energy spectrum, p, is slightly larger than 2 and\ndecreases with velocity upstream of the shock. This possibility is consistent\nwith our measurements, but requires shocks throughout the jet volume rather\nthan at a few discrete locations. A second possibility is that two acceleration\nmechanisms operate in these jets: one (with p = 2.32) dominant close to the\ngalactic nucleus and associated with high flow speeds, another (with p = 2.18)\ntaking over at larger distances and slower flow speeds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Mar 2013 21:10:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

Due to the heterogeneous nature of the area it is frequently\ndifficult to verify the scope of each result. In this paper we take closer look\nat recent developments, and provide additional results. Our analysis allows us\ncreate a taxonomy of the chase variations and the properties they satisfy.\n  Two of the most central problems regarding the chase is termination, and\ndiscovery of restricted classes of sets of dependencies that guarantee\ntermination of the chase. The search for the restricted classes has been\nmotivated by a fairly recent result that shows that it is undecidable to\ndetermine whether the chase with a given dependency set will terminate on a\ngiven instance. There is a small dissonance here, since the quest has been for\nclasses of sets of dependencies guaranteeing termination of the chase on all\ninstances, even though the latter problem was not known to be undecidable.

In the soft\nenergy region (p gT), the simple perturbative expansion called the hard thermal\nloop (HTL) approximation can be applied, and that approximation expects the\nexistence of the bosonic and fermionic collective excitations called plasmon\nand plasmino. On the other hand, in the ultrasoft energy region (p g^2T), the\nHTL approximation is inapplicable due to infrared singularity, so the question\nwhether there are any excitation modes in that energy region has not been\nstudied well. In this thesis, we analyze the quark spectrum whose energy is\nultrasoft in QGP, using the resummed perturbation theory which enables us to\nsuccessfully regularize the infrared singularity. Since the Yukawa model and\nQED are simpler than QCD but have some similarity to QCD, we also work in these\nmodels. As a result, we establish the existence of a novel fermionic mode in\nthe ultrasoft energy region, and obtain the expressions of the pole position\nand the strength of that mode. We also show that the Ward-Takahashi identity is\nsatisfied in the resummed perturbation theory in QED/QCD. Furthermore, we\nderive the linearized and generalized Boltzmann equation for the ultrasoft\nfermion excitations in the Kadanoff-Baym formalism, and show that the resultant\nequation is equivalent to the self-consistent equation in the resummed\nperturbation theory.

The study focuses on globally modulated STDP, as\na special use-case of this method. Flexibility is achieved by embedding a\ngeneral-purpose processor dedicated to plasticity into the wafer. To evaluate\nthe suitability of the proposed system, we use a reward modulated STDP rule in\na spike train learning task. A single layer of neurons is trained to fire at\nspecific points in time with only the reward as feedback. This model is\nsimulated to measure its performance, i.e. the increase in received reward\nafter learning. Using this performance as baseline, we then simulate the model\nwith various constraints imposed by the proposed implementation and compare the\nperformance. The simulated constraints include discretized synaptic weights, a\nrestricted interface between analog synapses and embedded processor, and\nmismatch of analog circuits. We find that probabilistic updates can increase\nthe performance of low-resolution weights, a simple interface between analog\nsynapses and processor is sufficient for learning, and performance is\ninsensitive to mismatch. Further, we consider communication latency between\nwafer and the conventional control computer system that is simulating the\nenvironment. This latency increases the delay, with which the reward is sent to\nthe embedded processor. Because of the time continuous operation of the analog\nsynapses, delay can cause a deviation of the updates as compared to the not\ndelayed situation. We find that for highly accelerated systems latency has to\nbe kept to a minimum.

Second,\nin the context of holography, we show that by using symmetric tensors, a global\nsymmetry at the boundary becomes a local symmetry in the bulk, thus explicitly\nrealizing in the MERA a characteristic feature of the AdS/CFT correspondence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Mar 2013 01:04:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Apr 2013 00:20:19 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 15 Sep 2013 21:51:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

We further find that having D7-branes and a resolved conifold\ntogether give rise to a non-trivial D-term on the D7-branes. This\nsupersymmetry-breaking term vanishes when we take the singular conifold limit,\nalthough supersymmetry appears to remain broken.

Genomic DNA is already\nused on Earth to store non-biological information. Though smaller in capacity,\nbut stronger in noise immunity is the genetic code. The code is a flexible\nmapping between codons and amino acids, and this flexibility allows modifying\nthe code artificially. But once fixed, the code might stay unchanged over\ncosmological timescales. Thus, it represents a reliable storage for an\nintelligent signature, if that conforms to biological and thermodynamic\nrequirements. As the actual scenario for the origin of terrestrial life is far\nfrom being settled, the proposal that it might have been seeded intentionally\ncannot be ruled out. A statistically strong signal in the genetic code is then\na testable consequence of such scenario.

It will soon become possible to directly link the most accurate\nradio reference frame with the Gaia optical reference frame using many common\nextragalactic objects. It is important to know the level of coincidence between\nthe radio and optical positions of compact active galactic nuclei (AGN). Aims.\nUsing the best catalogues available at present, we investigate how many AGN\nwith significantly large optical-radio positional offsets exist as well as the\npossible causes of these offsets. Methods. We performed a case study by finding\noptical counterparts to the International Celestial Reference Frame (ICRF2)\nradio sources in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 9 (DR9). The\nICRF2 catalogue was used as a reference because the radio positions determined\nby Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) observations are about two orders\nof magnitude more accurate than the optical positions. Results. We find 1297\nobjects in common for ICRF2 and SDSS DR9. Statistical analysis of the\noptical-radio differences verifies that the SDSS DR9 positions are accurate to\n~55 mas in both coordinates, with no systematic offset with respect to ICRF2.\nWe find 51 sources (~4% of the sample) for which the positional offset exceeds\n170 mas (~3{\\sigma}). Astrophysical explanations must exist for most of these\noutliers. There are 3 known strong gravitational lenses among them. Dual AGN or\nrecoiling supermassive black holes may also be possible. Conclusions. The most\naccurate Gaia-VLBI reference frame link will require a careful selection of a\ncommon set of objects by eliminating the outliers. On the other hand, the\nsignificant optical-radio positional non-coincidences may offer a new tool for\nfinding e.g. gravitational lenses or dual AGN candidates. Detailed follow-up\nradio interferometric and optical spectroscopic observations are encouraged to\ninvestigate the outlier sources found in this study.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Mar 2013 08:41:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

In a communication system with time\nvarying channel qualities, it is important to allocate the limited transmission\npower to channels that will be in good state. However, it is very challenging\nto do so because channel states are usually unknown when the power allocation\ndecision is made. In this paper, we derive an optimal power allocation policy\nthat can maximize the expected discounted number of bits transmitted over an\ninfinite time span by allocating the transmission power only to those channels\nthat are believed to be good in the coming time slot. We use the concept belief\nto represent the probability that a channel will be good and derive an optimal\npower allocation policy that establishes a mapping from the channel belief to\nan allocation decision.\n  Specifically, we first model this problem as a partially observable Markov\ndecision processes (POMDP), and analytically investigate the structure of the\noptimal policy.

In the solar\ncontext, the free energy is one of the main indicators used in space weather\nforecasts to predict the eruptivity of active regions. A trustworthy estimation\nof the magnetic energy is therefore needed in three-dimensional models of the\nsolar atmosphere, eg in coronal fields reconstructions or numerical\nsimulations. The expression of the energy of a system as the sum of its\npotential energy and its free energy (Thomson's theorem) is strictly valid when\nthe magnetic field is exactly solenoidal. For numerical realizations on a\ndiscrete grid, this property may be only approximately fulfilled. We show that\nthe imperfect solenoidality induces terms in the energy that can lead to\nmisinterpreting the amount of free energy present in a magnetic configuration.\nWe consider a decomposition of the energy in solenoidal and nonsolenoidal parts\nwhich allows the unambiguous estimation of the nonsolenoidal contribution to\nthe energy. We apply this decomposition to six typical cases broadly used in\nsolar physics. We quantify to what extent the Thomson theorem is not satisfied\nwhen approximately solenoidal fields are used. The quantified errors on energy\nvary from negligible to significant errors, depending on the extent of the\nnonsolenoidal component. We identify the main source of errors and analyze the\nimplications of adding a variable amount of divergence to various solenoidal\nfields. Finally, we present pathological unphysical situations where the\nestimated free energy would appear to be negative, as found in some previous\nworks, and we identify the source of this error to be the presence of a finite\ndivergence. We provide a method of quantifying the effect of a finite\ndivergence in numerical fields, together with detailed diagnostics of its\nsources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Mar 2013 09:48:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

This\nemission constitutes a significant fraction of the pulsar spin-down luminosity.\nIt is not clear however, how the highly magnetized pulsar wind could convert\nits mainly electromagnetic energy into the particles with such high efficiency.\nHere we investigate a scenario in which a pulsar striped wind converts into a\nstrong electromagnetic wave before reaching the shock. This mode can be thought\nof as a shock precursor that is able to accelerate particles to\nultrarelativistic energies at the expense of the electromagnetic energy it\ncarries.

Molecular crowding on\nthe DNA is likely to influence the association rate of TFs to their target site\nand the steady state occupancy of those sites, but it is still not clear how it\ninfluences the search in a genome-wide context, when the model includes\nbiologically relevant parameters (such as: TF abundance, TF affinity for DNA\nand TF dynamics on the DNA). We performed stochastic simulations of TFs\nperforming the facilitated diffusion mechanism, and considered various\nabundances of cognate and non-cognate TFs. We show that, for both obstacles\nthat move on the DNA and obstacles that are fixed on the DNA, changes in search\ntime are not statistically significant in case of biologically relevant\ncrowding levels on the DNA. In the case of non-cognate proteins that slide on\nthe DNA, molecular crowding on the DNA always leads to statistically\nsignificant lower levels of occupancy, which may confer a general mechanism to\ncontrol gene activity levels globally. When the `other' molecules are immobile\non the DNA, we found a completely different behaviour, namely: the occupancy of\nthe target site is always increased by higher molecular crowding on the DNA.\nFinally, we show that crowding on the DNA may increase transcriptional noise\nthrough increased variability of the occupancy time of the target sites.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Mar 2013 11:25:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Aug 2013 12:48:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-20"}

Shortly after\nthe big bang, the isotropy of the Higgs-field is broken during the expansion\nand cooling of the universe. Kibble proposed the formation of monopoles,\nstrings, and membranes in the Higgs field since the phase of the symmetry\nbroken field can not switch globally to gain the same value everywhere in\nspace. Zurek pointed out that the same mechanism is relevant for second order\nphase transitions in condensed matter systems. Every finite cooling rate\ninduces the system to fall out of equilibrium which is due to the critical\nslowing down of order parameter fluctuations: the correlation time diverges and\nthe symmetry of the system can not change globally but incorporates defects\nbetween different domains. Depending on the cooling rate the heterogeneous\norder parameter pattern are a fingerprint of critical fluctuations.

In general, we find a good agreement between the theoretically predicted\nand observed Doppler shifts of Fe I line cores, with somewhat larger\ndiscrepancies seen in the case of weaker (equivalent width W < 5 pm) and\nstronger lines (W > 11 pm). Both observed and theoretical coreshifts cover a\nrange between 0 and -1 km/s, with increasingly stronger blueshifts for weaker\nlines and slight hints of a coreshift dependence on wavelength. Theoretical\nbisectors reproduce the observed ones reasonably well too, however, theoretical\nbisectors of the weak red (lambda > 600 nm) Fe I lines have blueshifts that are\nby up to 200 m/s larger than observed.

However, it should be guaranteed in such\na structure that the non-thermometer code to binary code (NTH2B) encoding\nprocess should be finished within just one system clock cycle. So the\nimplementation of the NTH2B encoder is quite challenging considering the high\nspeed requirement. Besides, the high resolution wave union TDC also demands the\nencoder to convert an ultra-wide input code to a binary code. We present a fast\nimproved fat tree encoder (IFTE) to fulfill such requirements, in which bubble\nerror suppression is also integrated. With this encoder scheme, a wave union\nTDC with 7.7 ps RMS and 3.8 ps effective bin size was implemented in an FPGA\nfrom Xilinx Virtex 5 family. An encoding time of 8.33 ns was achieved for a\n276-bit non-thermometer code to a 9-bit binary code conversion. We conducted a\nseries of tests on the oscillating period of the wave union launcher, as well\nas the overall performance of the TDC; test results indicate that the IFTE\nworks well. In fact, in the implementation of this encoder, no manual routing\nor special constrains were required; therefore, this IFTE structure could also\nbe further applied in other delay chain based FPGA TDCs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Mar 2013 14:56:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is a very well-known\ntechnique for efficient data transmission over many carriers overlapped in\nfrequency. Recently, several papers have appeared which describe spectrally\nefficient variations of multi-carrier systems where the condition of\northogonality is dropped. Proposed techniques suffer from two weaknesses:\nFirstly, the complexity of generating the signal is increased. Secondly, the\nsignal detection is computationally demanding. Known methods suffer either\nunusably high complexity or high error rates because of the inter-carrier\ninterference. This work addresses both problems by proposing new transmitter\nand receiver arch itectures whose design is based on using the simplification\nthat a rational Spectrally Efficient Frequency Division Multiplexing (SEFDM)\nsystem can be treated as a set of overlapped and interleaving OFDM systems.\n  The efficacy of the proposed designs is shown through detailed simulation of\nsys tems with different signal types and carrier dimensions. The decoder is\nheuristic but in practice produces very good results which are close to the\ntheoretical best performance in a variety of settings. The system is able to\nproduce efficiency gains of up to 20% with negligible impact on the required\nsignal to noise ratio.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Mar 2013 15:22:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-28"}

We argue that the\ndiagnostic problem, as currently posed, is incomplete: it does not consider how\nthe diagnosis is to be used, or the utility associated with the treatment of\nthe abnormalities. In this paper we analyze several well-known definitions of\ndiagnosis, showing that the different definitions of the most likely diagnosis\nhave different qualitative meanings, even given the same input data. We argue\nthat the most appropriate definition of (optimal) diagnosis needs to take into\naccount the utility of outcomes and what the diagnosis is used for.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Mar 2013 13:55:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-05"}

Bayesian\nestimation mechanisms employing stochastic sensor models allow incremental\nupdating of the Occupancy Grid using multi-view, multi-sensor data, composition\nof multiple maps, decision-making, and incorporation of robot and sensor\nposition uncertainty.

Knowledge of\nthese contexts can be used in the task of using a mobile camera to search for a\nspecified object in a room. We call this the object search task. This paper is\nconcerned with representing this knowledge in a manner facilitating its\napplication to object search while at the same time lending itself to\nautonomous learning by a robot. The ability for the robot to learn such\nknowledge without supervision is crucial due to the vast number of possible\nrelationships that can exist for any given set of objects. Moreover, since a\nrobot will not have an infinite amount of time to learn, it must be able to\ndetermine an order in which to look for possible relationships so as to\nmaximize the rate at which new knowledge is gained. In effect, there must be a\n\"focus of interest\" operator that allows the robot to choose which examples are\nlikely to convey the most new information and should be examined first. This\npaper demonstrates how a representation based on statistical confidence\nintervals allows the construction of a system that achieves the above goals. An\nalgorithm, based on the Highest Impact First heuristic, is presented as a means\nfor providing a \"focus of interest\" with which to control the learning process,\nand examples are given.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Mar 2013 13:57:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-05"}

The functions, called valuations, represent the\nfactors of an objective function. Solving the optimization problem involves\nusing two operations called combination and marginalization.

The theory\nof belief functions uses the Dempster rule to combine two belief functions\ndefined by independent bodies of evidence. However, with limited dependency\ninformation about the accumulated belief the Dempster rule may lead to\nunsatisfactory results. The present study suggests a method to determine the\naccumulated belief based on the premise that the information gain from the\ncombination process should be minimum. This method provides a mechanism that is\nequivalent to the Bayes rule when all the conditional probabilities are\navailable and to the Dempster rule when the normalization constant is equal to\none. The proposed principle of minimum information gain is shown to be\nequivalent to the maximum entropy formalism, a special case of the principle of\nminimum cross-entropy.
