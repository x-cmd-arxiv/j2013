We relax the common gradient\nLipschitz-continuity condition and strong convexity condition to ones that hold\nonly over certain line segments. Specifically, we establish complexities\n$O(\\frac{R}{\\epsilon})$ and $O(\\sqrt{\\frac{R}{\\epsilon}})$ for the ordinary and\naccelerate gradient methods, respectively, assuming that $\\nabla f$ is\nLipschitz continuous with constant $R$ over the line segment joining $x$ and\n$x-\\frac{1}{R}\\nabla f$ for each $x\\in\\dom f$. Then we improve them to\n$O(\\frac{R}{\\nu}\\log(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}))$ and\n$O(\\sqrt{\\frac{R}{\\nu}}\\log(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}))$ for function $f$ that also\nsatisfies the secant inequality $\\ < \\nabla f(x), x- x^*\\ > \\ge \\nu\\|x-x^*\\|^2$\nfor each $x\\in \\dom f$ and its projection $x^*$ to the minimizer set of $f$.\nThe secant condition is also shown to be necessary for the geometric decay of\nsolution error. Not only are the relaxed conditions met by more functions, the\nrestrictions give smaller $R$ and larger $\\nu$ than they are without the\nrestrictions and thus lead to better complexity bounds. We apply these results\nto sparse optimization and demonstrate a faster algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Mar 2013 16:03:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 8 Sep 2013 01:17:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-10"}

In particular, we\nintroduce the Feynman propagator for unstable scalar resonances and motivate\nthe idea that this kind of correlation function should possess complex poles\nwhich parameterize the mass and decay width of the considered particle. We also\nbriefly discuss the problematic scalar sector in particle physics, emphasizing\nthat hadronic loop contributions dominate its dynamics. A whole chapter is\ndedicated to the method of analytic continuation of complex functions through\nbranch cuts into the so called second Riemann sheet. This method is crucial in\norder to describe physics of scalar resonances because the Feynman propagator\nof interacting quantum field theories will have branch cuts in the complex\nenergy plane and complex poles in the second Riemann sheet.\n  We then apply these concepts to a simple non-relativistic Lee model and\ndemonstrate the physical implications, i.e., the motion of the propagator poles\nand the behaviour of the spectral function. Besides that, we investigate the\ntime evolution of a particle described by such a model.\n  In the last chapter, we finally concentrate on a simple quantum field\ntheoretical model which describes the decay of a scalar state into two\n(pseudo)scalar ones. It is investigated how the motion of the propagator poles\nis influenced by loop contributions of the two (pseudo)scalar particles. We\nperform a numerical study for a hadronic system involving a scalar seed state\n(alias the \\sigma-meson) that couples to pions. The unexpected emergence of a\nputative stable state below the two-pion threshold is investigated and it is\nclarified under which conditions such a stable state appears.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Mar 2013 16:47:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 May 2013 12:41:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 8 Aug 2013 08:56:09 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 7 Nov 2013 09:25:42 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 24 Apr 2014 10:43:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-25"}

However, given that Y can be measured spectroscopically\nin only a small percentage of stars, a linear relationship is assumed between Y\nand the mass fraction of metals (Z). This Y-Z relation is generally represented\nas Y=Yp+DY/DZxZ, with the value of the helium-to-metal enrichment ratio (DY/DZ)\nassumed as a constant. However, there is no fundamental reason for every star\nto have a Y value on a linear scale with Z. In this paper a method for\ndetermining the FSPs of nearby stars is presented that uses at the same time\nMbol, Teff, and log g. One of these parameters is Y, which is used to determine\nthe validity of the Y-Z relation. A new set of evolutionary tracks is created\nusing the PGPUC stellar evolution code, which includes 7 masses\n(0.5<M/Msun<1.1), 7 helium abundances (0.230<Y<0.370), and 12 metallicities\n(1.6x10^-4<Z<6.0x10^-2) for solar-scaled chemical compositions\n([alpha/Fe]=0.0). The suggested method is tested using two different\nspectroscopic databases of nearby main sequence stars with precise parallaxes,\nand spectroscopic measurements of [Fe/H], Teff and g. The proposed method is\ncompared to other techniques used to determine the FSPs, where one assumes an\nage of 5 Gyr for all nearby stars. This comparison demonstrates that the\nhypothesis regarding constant age leads to an underestimation of the Y value,\nespecially for low metallicities. In addition, the suggested method is limited\nto masses above 0.60 Msun and requires high-precision measurements of\nspectroscopic surface gravities in order to obtain reliable results. Finally,\nestimating masses and ages assuming a Y-Z relation rather than a free Y value\nmay induce average errors of approximately 0.02 Msun and 2 Gyr, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Mar 2013 18:19:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 22 Mar 2013 11:26:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

In the presence of dissipation, the fluctuations\ncan be driven non-Gaussian if there is macroscopic energy transfer from large\nto small scales.

Energy fluctuations in the\nphenomenological model map directly onto the 1/f^alpha noise problem and\nnumerical simulations of the stochastic model yield results in qualitative\nagreement with these predictions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Mar 2013 18:27:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 26 Jun 2013 08:04:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-27"}

Entanglement is one of these\nresources, arising when quantum communication and nonlocal operations are\nexpensive to perform. In the first part of this thesis we quantify the\neffective entanglement when operations are additionally restricted. For an\nimportant class of errors we find a linear relationship between the usual and\neffective higher dimensional generalization of concurrence, a measure of\nentanglement.\n  In the second chapter we focus on nonlocality in the presence of\nsuperselection rules, where we propose a scheme that may be used to activate\nnongenuinely multipartite nonlocality with multiple copies of the state. We\nshow that whenever the number of particles is insufficient, the genuinely\nmultipartite nonlocality is degraded to nongenuinely multipartite.\n  While in the first few chapters we focus on understanding the resources\npresent in quantum states, in the final part we turn the picture around and\ninstead treat operations themselves as a resource. We provide our observers\nwith free access to classical operations - ie. those that cannot detect or\ngenerate quantum coherence. We show that the operation of interest can then be\nused to either generate or detect quantum coherence if and only if it violates\na particular commutation relation. Using the relative entropy, the commutation\nrelation provides us with a measure of nonclassicality of operations. We show\nthat the measure is a sum of two contributions, the generating power and the\ndistinguishing power, each of which is separately an essential ingredient in\nquantum communication and information processing. The measure also sheds light\non the operational meaning of quantum discord, which we show can be interpreted\nas the difference in superdense coding capacity between a quantum state and a\nclassical state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Mar 2013 18:31:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-20"}

It is found that\nthe Sersic r^1/n model produce good fits to the core regions of ellipticals (r\n< r_half), but is an inadequate function for the entire profile of an\nelliptical from core to halo due to competing effects on the Sersic n index and\nthe fact that the interior shape of an elliptical is only weakly correlated\nwith its halo shape.

In this work we investigate\nsimultaneously the impact of the method used to account for masked regions and\nthe impact of the ISW effect, which is the large-scale secondary anisotropy\nmost likely to affect the CMB anomalies. In this sense, our work is an update\nof both Francis & Peacock 2010 and Kim et al. 2012. Our aim is to identify\ntrends in CMB data with different mask treatments.

We focus\non three large-scale CMB anomalies: the low quadrupole, the quad/oct alignment,\nand the octopole planarity. After sparse inpainting, the low quadrupole becomes\nmore anomalous, whilst the quad/oct alignment becomes less anomalous. The\nsignificance of the low quadrupole is unchanged after subtraction of the ISW\neffect, while the trend is that the quad/oct alignment has reduced\nsignificance, yet other hypotheses remain possible as well (e.g. exotic\nphysics).

The generators\nof such evolutions are called Lindbladians. In the setting of quantum many-body\nsystems on a lattice it is natural to consider Lindbladians that decompose into\na sum of local interactions with decreasing strength with respect to the size\nof their support. For both practical and theoretical reasons, it is crucial to\nestimate the impact that perturbations in the generating Lindbladian, arising\nas noise or errors, can have on the evolution. These local perturbations are\npotentially unbounded, but constrained to respect the underlying lattice\nstructure. We show that even for polynomially decaying errors in the\nLindbladian, local observables and correlation functions are stable if the\nunperturbed Lindbladian has a unique fixed point and a mixing time which scales\nlogarithmically with the system size. The proof relies on Lieb-Robinson bounds,\nwhich describe a finite group velocity for propagation of information in local\nsystems. As a main example, we prove that classical Glauber dynamics is stable\nunder local perturbations, including perturbations in the transition rates\nwhich may not preserve detailed balance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Mar 2013 20:00:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 Oct 2013 18:46:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 29 Sep 2014 14:22:21 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 28 Apr 2015 12:37:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-29"}

For self-confined CRs, this depends on the source of MHD wave\ndamping: if only non-linear Landau damping operates, then CRs stream on the\nslow Alfvenic timescale, but if turbulent wave damping operates, super-Alfvenic\nstreaming is possible. As turbulence increases, it promotes outward streaming\nmore than it enables inward turbulent advection. Curiously, the CR flux is\nindependent of $\\nabla f$ (as long as it is non-zero) and depends only on\nplasma parameters; this enables radio halos with flat inferred CR profiles to\nturn off. We perform 1D time-dependent calculations of a radio mini-halo\n(Perseus) and giant radio halo (Coma) and find that both diminish in radio\nluminosity by an order of magnitude in several hundred Myr, given plausible\nestimates for the magnetic field in the outskirts of the cluster. Due to the\nenergy dependence of CR streaming, spectral curvature develops, and radio halos\nturn off more slowly at low frequencies -- properties consistent with\nobservations. Similarly, CR streaming rapidly turns off gamma-ray emission at\nthe high-energies probed by Cherenkov telescopes, but not at the low energies\nprobed by Fermi. CR mediated wave-heating of the ICM is unaffected, as it is\ndominated by ~GeV CRs which stream Alfvenically.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Mar 2013 20:02:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

In this\npaper, we propose a general framework for distributed estimation based on a\nmaximum marginal likelihood (MML) approach.

Our aim is to spatially resolve the outer atmosphere\n(so-called MOLsphere) in individual CO first overtone lines and derive its\nphysical properties, which are important for understanding the mass-loss\nmechanism in normal (i.e., non-Mira) K--M giants. Methods: Aldebaran was\nobserved between 2.28 and 2.31 micron with a projected baseline length of 10.4m\nand a spectral resolution of 12000. Results: The uniform-disk diameter observed\nin the CO first overtone lines is 20--35% larger than is measured in the\ncontinuum. We have also detected a signature of inhomogeneities in the\nCO-line-forming region on a spatial scale of ~45 mas, which is more than twice\nas large as the angular diameter of the star itself. While the MARCS\nphotospheric model reproduces the observed spectrum well, the angular size in\nthe CO lines predicted by the MARCS model is significantly smaller than\nobserved. This is because the MARCS model with the parameters of Aldebaran has\na geometrical extension of only ~2% (with respect to the stellar radius). The\nobserved spectrum and interferometric data in the CO lines can be\nsimultaneously reproduced by placing an additional CO layer above the MARCS\nphotosphere. This CO layer is extended to 2.5 +/- 0.3 stellar radii with CO\ncolumn densities of 5x10^{19}--2x10^{20} cm^-2 and a temperature of 1500 +/-\n200 K. Conclusions: The high spectral resolution of AMBER has enabled us to\nspatially resolve the inhomogeneous, extended outer atmosphere (MOLsphere) in\nthe individual CO lines for the first time in a K giant. Our modeling of the\nMOLsphere of Aldebaran suggests a rather small gradient in the temperature\ndistribution above the photosphere up to 2--3 stellar radii.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Mar 2013 20:44:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

To overcome this impairment, a hybrid automatic retransmission\nrequest (HARQ) protocol is combined with multi-layer broadcast transmission,\nthus allowing for variable-rate decoding. Moreover, motivated by cloud radio\naccess network applications, the relay operation is limited to\ncompress-and-forward. The aim is maximizing the throughput performance as\nmeasured by the average number of successfully received bits per channel use,\nunder either long-term static channel (LTSC) or short-term static channel\n(STSC) models.

Previous studies have found that an actomyosin ring (\"purse\nstring\") forms around the wound perimeter and contracts to close the wound over\nthe course of several dozens of minutes. Here, we report experiments that\nreveal an even faster mechanism which remarkably closes wounds by more than 50%\nwithin the first 30 seconds. Circular and elliptical wounds (~100 um in size)\nwere made in the blastoderm of early chick embryos and allowed to heal, with\nwound area and shape characterized as functions of time. The closure rate\ndisplayed a biphasic behavior, with rapid constriction lasting about a minute,\nfollowed by a period of more gradual closure to complete healing. Fluorescent\nstaining suggests that both healing phases are driven by actomyosin\ncontraction, with relatively rapid contraction of fibers at cell borders within\na relatively thick ring of tissue (several cells wide) around the wound\nfollowed by slower contraction of a thin supracellular actomyosin ring along\nthe margin, consistent with a purse string mechanism. Finite-element modeling\nshowed that this idea is biophysically plausible, with relatively isotropic\ncontraction within the thick ring giving way to tangential contraction in the\nthin ring. In addition, consistent with experimental results, simulated\nelliptical wounds heal with little change in aspect ratio, and decreased\nmembrane tension can cause these wounds to open briefly before going on to\nheal. These results provide new insight into the healing mechanism in embryonic\nepithelia.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Mar 2013 22:55:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Sep 2013 00:28:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 6 Sep 2013 03:38:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

The generalized Forchheimer law is\nconsidered for incompressible and slightly-compressible single-phase flows. We\nuse recently developed analytical results Aulisa et al. (2009) and write the\nresulting system in terms of a degenerate nonlinear flow equation for the\npressure with the nonlinearity that depends on the pressure gradient. The\ncoarse scale parameters for the steady state problem are determined so that the\nvolumetric average of velocity of the flow in the domain on fine scale and on\ncoarse scale are close enough. A flow-based coarsening approach is used, where\nthe equivalent permeability tensor is first evaluated following the streamline\nof the existing linear cases, and successively modified in order to take into\naccount the nonlinear effects. Compared to previous works Durlofsky and\nKarimi-Fard (2009) and Peszynska et al. (2009), our approach relies on recent\nanalytical results of Aulisa et al.

The developed upscaling\nalgorithm for nonlinear steady state problems is effectively used for variety\nof heterogeneities in the domain of computation. Direct numerical computations\nfor average velocity and productivity index justify the usage of the coarse\nscale parameters obtained for the special steady state case in the fully\ntransient problem. Analytical upscaling formulas in stratified domain are\nobtained for the nonlinear case.

The goal is\nthen to understand the world's data in terms of the parameters of the mixing\nmatrix and the differences between the squares of the masses of the neutrinos.\nAn outstanding question is what is the correct ordering of the masses, the\nhierarchy question.

Pf-beta\nwas serendipitously observed in NIRSPEC and CRIRES surveys of CO fundamental\nemission, amounting to a sample size of 120 young stars with detected Pf-beta\nemission. Using a subsample of disks with previously measured accretion\nluminosities, we show that Pf-beta line luminosity is well correlated with\naccretion luminosity over a range of at least three orders of magnitude. We use\nthis correlation to derive accretion luminosities for all 120 targets, 65 of\nwhich are previously unreported in the literature. We also report accretion\nrates for 67 targets, 16 previously unmeasured. Our large sample size and our\nability to probe high extinction values allow for relatively unbiased\ncomparisons between different types of disks. We find that the transitional\ndisks in our sample have lower than average Pf-beta line luminosities, and thus\naccretion luminosities, at a marginally significant level. We also show that\nhigh Pf-beta equivalent width is a signature of transitional disks with high\ninner disk gas/dust ratios. In contrast, we find that disks with signatures of\nslow disk winds have Pf-beta luminosities comparable to those of other disks in\nour sample. Finally, we investigate accretion rates for stage I disks,\nincluding significantly embedded targets. We find that stage I and stage II\ndisks have statistically indistinguishable Pf-beta line luminosities, implying\nsimilar accretion rates, and that the accretion rates of stage I disks are too\nlow to be consistent with quiescent accretion. Our results are instead\nconsistent with both observational and theoretical evidence that stage I\nobjects experience episodic, rather than quiescent, accretion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Mar 2013 01:10:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

As\nSSDs write data out-of-place, garbage collection (GC) is required to erase and\nreclaim space with invalid data. However, GC poses additional writes that\nhinder the I/O performance, while SSD blocks can only endure a finite number of\nerasures. Thus, there is a performance-durability tradeoff on the design space\nof GC. To characterize the optimal tradeoff, this paper formulates an\nanalytical model that explores the full optimal design space of any GC\nalgorithm. We first present a stochastic Markov chain model that captures the\nI/O dynamics of large-scale SSDs, and adapt the mean-field approach to derive\nthe asymptotic steady-state performance. We further prove the model convergence\nand generalize the model for all types of workload. Inspired by this model, we\npropose a randomized greedy algorithm (RGA) that can operate along the optimal\ntradeoff curve with a tunable parameter. Using trace-driven simulation on\nDiskSim with SSD add-ons, we demonstrate how RGA can be parameterized to\nrealize the performance-durability tradeoff.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Mar 2013 02:46:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 Mar 2013 03:39:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-22"}

It is found that there is a useful way to select red giant branch (RGB)\nstars from the contamination of other evolved stars such as asymptotic giant\nbranch (AGB) and red horizontal branch (RHB) stars by using the CH(G) index\nversus (g-r) diagram if the metallicity is known from the spectra. When this\ndiagram is applied to field giant stars with similar metallicity, we establish\na calibration of CH(G)=1.625(g-r)-1.174(g-r)^2-0.934. This method is confirmed\nby stars with [Fe/H]~2.3 where spectra of member stars in globular clusters M15\nand M92 are available in the SDSS database. We thus extend this kind of\ncalibration to every individual metallicity bin ranging from [Fe/H] ~ -3.0 to\n[Fe/H] ~ 0.0 by using field red giant stars with 0.4 < (g-r) < 1.0.

With the two calibrations, a significant\nnumber of the contaminating stars (AGB and RHB stars) were excluded and thus a\nclear sample of red giant stars is obtained by selecting stars within 0.05 mag\nof the calibration. The sample is published online and it is expected that this\nlarge and clean sample of RGB stars will provide new information on the\nformation and evolution of the Galaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Mar 2013 03:03:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

The genetic\ndiversity contained in the global population of yeast strains represents a\nvaluable resource for a number of fields, including genetics, bioengineering,\nand studies of evolution and population structure. Here, we apply a\nmultiplexed, reduced genome sequencing strategy (known as RAD-seq) to genotype\na large collection of S. cerevisiae strains, isolated from a wide range of\ngeographical locations and environmental niches. The method permits the\nsequencing of the same 1% of all genomes, producing a multiple sequence\nalignment of 116,880 bases across 262 strains. We find diversity among these\nstrains is principally organized by geography, with European, North American,\nAsian and African/S. E. Asian populations defining the major axes of genetic\nvariation. At a finer scale, small groups of strains from cacao, olives and\nsake are defined by unique variants not present in other strains. One\npopulation, containing strains from a variety of fermentations, exhibits high\nlevels of heterozygosity and mixtures of alleles from European and Asian\npopulations, indicating an admixed origin for this group. In the context of\nthis global diversity, we demonstrate that a collection of seven strains\ncommonly used in the laboratory encompasses only one quarter of the genetic\ndiversity present in the full collection of strains, underscoring the\nrelatively limited genetic diversity captured by the current set of lab\nstrains. We propose a model of geographic differentiation followed by\nhuman-associated admixture, primarily between European and Asian populations\nand more recently between European and North American populations. The large\ncollection of genotyped yeast strains characterized here will provide a useful\nresource for the broad community of yeast researchers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Mar 2013 04:08:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-13"}

When a star is disrupted in a bound\norbit with moderate eccentricity instead of a parabolic orbit, the temporal\nbehavior of the resulting stellar debris changes qualitatively. The debris is\ninitially all bound, returning to pericenter in a short time ~ the original\nstellar orbital timescale. The resulting fallback rate can thus be much higher\nthan the Eddington rate. Furthermore if the star is disrupted close to the\nhole, in a regime where general relativity is important, the stellar and debris\norbits display general relativistic precession. Apsidal precession can make the\ndebris stream cross itself after several orbits, likely leading to fast debris\nenergy dissipation. If the star is disrupted in an inclined orbit around a\nspinning hole, nodal precession reduces the probability of self-intersection,\nand circularization may take many dynamical timescales, delaying the onset of\nflare activity. An examination of the particle dynamics suggests that\nquasi-periodic flares with short durations, produced when the center of the\ntidal stream passes pericenter, may occur in the early-time light curve. The\nlate-time light curve may still show power-law behavior which is generic to\ndisk accretion processes. The detection triggers for future surveys should be\nextended to capture such \"non-standard\" short-term flaring activity before the\nevent enters the asymptotic decay phase, as this activity is likely to be more\nsensitive to physical parameters such as the black hole spin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Mar 2013 04:20:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Sep 2013 21:21:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

More generally, an infinite family of lattice loop\nmodels is studied on the torus and related to the corresponding\nFortuin-Kasteleyn random cluster models. Starting with a cylinder, the\ncommuting periodic single-row transfer matrices are built from the periodic\nTemperley-Lieb algebra extended by the shift operators Omega and Omega^{-1}. In\nthis enlarged algebra, the non-contractible loop fugacity is alpha and the\ncontractible loop fugacity is beta. The torus is formed by gluing the top and\nbottom of the cylinder. This gives rise to a variety of non-contractible loops\nwinding around the torus. Because of their nonlocal nature, the standard matrix\ntrace does not produce the proper geometric torus. Instead, we introduce a\nmodified matrix trace for this purpose. This is achieved by using a\nrepresentation of the enlarged periodic Temperley-Lieb algebra with a parameter\nv that keeps track of the winding of defects on the cylinder. The transfer\nmatrix representatives and their eigenvalues thus depend on v. The modified\ntrace is constructed as a linear functional on planar connectivity diagrams in\nterms of matrix traces Tr_d (with a fixed number of defects d) and Chebyshev\npolynomials of the first kind. For critical dense polymers, where beta=0, the\ntransfer matrix eigenvalues are obtained by solving a functional equation in\nthe form of an inversion identity. The solution depends on d and is subject to\nselection rules which we prove. Simplifications occur if all non-contractible\nloop fugacities are set to alpha=2 in which case the traces are evaluated at\nv=1. In the continuum scaling limit, the corresponding conformal torus\npartition function obtained from finite-size corrections agrees with the known\nmodular invariant partition function of symplectic fermions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Mar 2013 10:25:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 May 2013 01:25:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

The integrality gap is\nknown to be $\\Omega(\\sqrt{n})$ even for planar graphs due to a simple\ntopological obstruction and a major focus, following earlier work, has been\nunderstanding the gap if some constant congestion is allowed.\n  In this context, it is natural to ask for which classes of graphs does a\nconstant-factor constant-congestion property hold. It is easy to deduce that\nfor given constant bounds on the approximation and congestion, the class of\n\"nice\" graphs is nor-closed. Is the converse true? Does every proper\nminor-closed family of graphs exhibit a constant factor, constant congestion\nbound relative to the LP relaxation? We conjecture that the answer is yes.\n  One stumbling block has been that such bounds were not known for bounded\ntreewidth graphs (or even treewidth 3). In this paper we give a polytime\nalgorithm which takes a fractional routing solution in a graph of bounded\ntreewidth and is able to integrally route a constant fraction of the LP\nsolution's value. Note that we do not incur any edge congestion. Previously\nthis was not known even for series parallel graphs which have treewidth 2. The\nalgorithm is based on a more general argument that applies to $k$-sums of\ngraphs in some graph family, as long as the graph family has a constant factor,\nconstant congestion bound.

This question extends to a pair of randomness notions R and S, where\nS is weaker: for which A is S^A still weaker than R? In the last few years,\nmany results have characterized the sequences that are low for randomness by\ntheir low computational strength. A few results have also given\nmeasure-theoretic characterizations of low sequences. For example, Kjos-Hanssen\nproved that A is low for Martin-L\u007f\\\"of randomness if and only if every A-c.e.\nopen set of measure less than 1 can be covered by a c.e. open set of measure\nless than 1.

The dynamics of pol-II moving along the transcribed region\ninfluence the rate and timing of gene expression. In this work we present a\nprobabilistic model of transcription dynamics which is fitted to pol-II\noccupancy time course data measured using ChIP-Seq. The model can be used to\nestimate transcription speed and to infer the temporal pol-II activity profile\nat the gene promoter. Model parameters are estimated using either maximum\nlikelihood estimation or via Bayesian inference using Markov chain Monte Carlo\nsampling. The Bayesian approach provides confidence intervals for parameter\nestimates and allows the use of priors that capture domain knowledge, e.g. the\nexpected range of transcription speeds, based on previous experiments. The\nmodel describes the movement of pol-II down the gene body and can be used to\nidentify the time of induction for transcriptionally engaged genes. By\nclustering the inferred promoter activity time profiles, we are able to\ndetermine which genes respond quickly to stimuli and group genes that share\nactivity profiles and may therefore be co-regulated.

Its computational intractability has\nattracted a number of heuristic approaches to generate satisfactory, if not\noptimal, candidate solutions. In this paper we demonstrate a simple\nunconventional computation method to approximate the Euclidean TSP using a\nvirtual material approach. The morphological adaptation behaviour of the\nmaterial emerges from the low-level interactions of a population of particles\nmoving within a diffusive lattice. A `blob' of this material is placed over a\nset of data points projected into the lattice, representing TSP city locations,\nand the blob is reduced in size over time. As the blob shrinks it\nmorphologically adapts to the configuration of the cities. The shrinkage\nprocess automatically stops when the blob no longer completely covers all\ncities. By manually tracing the perimeter of the blob a path between cities is\nelicited corresponding to a TSP tour. Over 6 runs on 20 randomly generated\ndatasets of 20 cities this simple and unguided method found tours with a mean\nbest tour length of 1.04, mean average tour length of 1.07 and mean worst tour\nlength of 1.09 when expressed as a fraction of the minimal tour computed by an\nexact TSP solver. We examine the insertion mechanism by which the blob\nconstructs a tour, note some properties and limitations of its performance, and\ndiscuss the relationship between the blob TSP and proximity graphs which group\npoints on the plane. The method is notable for its simplicity and the spatially\nrepresented mechanical mode of its operation.

In Dempster?s\ncategory, the new defined conjunction can be seen as the most cautious\nconjunction of beliefs, and thus no assumption about distinctness (of the\nsources) of beliefs is needed as opposed to Dempster?s rule of combination,\nwhich calls for distinctness (of the sources) of beliefs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Mar 2013 15:31:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-26"}

A priori\nuncertainty about the actual result of the experiment may be quantified,\nrepresenting either the likelihood of the choice of :r_X or the degree to which\nany such X would be suitable as a description of the outcome. The former case\ncorresponds to a probability distribution, while the latter gives a possibility\nassignment on X. The study of such assignments and their properties falls\nwithin the purview of possibility theory [DP88, Y80, Z783. It, like probability\ntheory, assigns values between 0 and 1 to express likelihoods of outcomes.\nHere, however, the similarity ends. Possibility theory uses the maximum and\nminimum functions to combine uncertainties, whereas probability theory uses the\nplus and times operations. This leads to very dissimilar theories in terms of\nanalytical framework, even though they share several semantic concepts. One of\nthe shared concepts consists of expressing quantitatively the uncertainty\nassociated with a given distribution. In probability theory its value\ncorresponds to the gain of information that would result from conducting an\nexperiment and ascertaining an actual result. This gain of information can\nequally well be viewed as a decrease in uncertainty about the outcome of an\nexperiment. In this case the standard measure of information, and thus\nuncertainty, is Shannon entropy [AD75, G77]. It enjoys several advantages-it is\ncharacterized uniquely by a few, very natural properties, and it can be\nconveniently used in decision processes. This application is based on the\nprinciple of maximum entropy; it has become a popular method of relating\ndecisions to uncertainty. This paper demonstrates that an equally integrated\ntheory can be built on the foundation of possibility theory. We first show how\nto define measures of in formation and uncertainty for possibility assignments.\nNext we construct an information-based metric on the space of all possibility\ndistributions defined on a given domain. It allows us to capture the notion of\nproximity in information content among the distributions. Lastly, we show that\nall the above constructions can be carried out for continuous\ndistributions-possibility assignments on arbitrary measurable domains. We\nconsider this step very significant-finite domains of discourse are but\napproximations of the real-life infinite domains. If possibility theory is to\nrepresent real world situations, it must handle continuous distributions both\ndirectly and through finite approximations. In the last section we discuss a\nprinciple of maximum uncertainty for possibility distributions. We show how\nsuch a principle could be formalized as an inference rule. We also suggest it\ncould be derived as a consequence of simple assumptions about combining\ninformation. We would like to mention that possibility assignments can be\nviewed as fuzzy sets and that every fuzzy set gives rise to an assignment of\npossibilities. This correspondence has far reaching consequences in logic and\nin control theory. Our treatment here is independent of any special\ninterpretation; in particular we speak of possibility distributions and\npossibility measures, defining them as measurable mappings into the interval\n[0, 1]. Our presentation is intended as a self-contained, albeit terse summary.\nTopics discussed were selected with care, to demonstrate both the completeness\nand a certain elegance of the theory. Proofs are not included; we only offer\nillustrative examples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Mar 2013 15:32:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-26"}

In contrast to well known\nstrategies it is not sequentially and hypotheses-driven, but parallel and self\norganizing, determined by the concept of information gain. The information\ngain, calculated as the maximal difference between the actual evidence\ndistribution in the knowledge base and the potential evidence determines each\nconsultation step. Hierarchically structured knowledge is an important\nrepresentation form and experts even use several hierarchies in parallel for\nconstituting their knowledge. Hence the control strategy is applied to a\nlayered set of distinct hierarchies. Depending on the actual data one of these\nhierarchies is chosen by the control strategy for the next step in the\nreasoning process. Provided the actual data are well matched to the structure\nof one hierarchy, this hierarchy remains selected for a longer consultation\ntime. If no good match can be achieved, a switch from the actual hierarchy to a\ncompeting one will result, very similar to the phenomenon of restructuring in\nproblem solving tasks. Up to now the control strategy is restricted to multi\nhierarchical knowledge bases with disjunct hierarchies. It is implemented in\nthe expert system IBIG (inference by information gain), being presently applied\nto acquired speech disorders (aphasia).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Mar 2013 15:33:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-26"}

Knowledge of the differences in costs per kilometre, including\nexplanations of differences and their breakdowns is currently lacking in the\nliterature. This paper aims to provide a first stage insight into how cost per\nkilometre varies across urban rail projects. The methodology applied is a\nsimple cost comparison across projects where the data collected are comparable.\nWe conclude that capital costs per route-kilometre of urban rail vary highly\nbetween projects. Looking at European projects and excluding outliers, the\ntotal capital costs per route-kilometre (including stations and rolling stock)\nlie mainly between US$50-100 million (2002 prices). Including US projects, the\nrange is US$50-150 million. The main reasons for the high variation in the\nroute-kilometre costs are differences between projects as regards the ratio of\nunderground to above-ground construction, ground conditions, station spacing,\ntype of rolling stock, environmental and safety constraints and labour costs.\nWe warn, however, that the observations used to reach the conclusions are too\nfew to obtain results with statistical significance. Our results must therefore\nbe seen as a first step towards collecting more data so that a more succinct\nstatistical analysis can be conducted. Another conclusion is therefore that\nthis area has future research potential.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Mar 2013 11:33:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-27"}

Finally, studying the squared speed of the sound $v_s^2$\nfor our model, we found that is classically stable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Mar 2013 10:40:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-31"}
