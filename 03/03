Due to issues regarding memory, physical strength and\nreduced self-assessment, old people face a lot of challenges in accomplishing\ntheir activities of daily living. This thesis is meant to address these\nproblems by analysing the required infrastructure of a home-care facility as\nwell as the arising issues regarding used components, especially wireless\nsensors. After the analysis, a prototype of a home-care system is designed and\nimplemented. Furthermore, the issue of energy consumption of the used wireless\nsensor node is addressed by modifying the intelligence of the used sensor.\nAfter that, the design and components of the prototype used for the energy\nconsumption analysis is explained, together with the programming structure of\nthe sensor nodes used in this thesis. Thereupon, the results are of the\nsimulations are discussed and compared with the authors' expectations. Finally\nthe overall outcomes of the thesis are analysed and summed up, followed by a\nshort outlook of further possible improvements and developments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Mar 2013 16:08:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-05"}

However, variation in severity and\npenetrance of neonatal diabetes, as in other complex genetic diseases, cannot\nbe accounted for by known disease mutations. In a novel approach to this\nproblem, we have utilized the genetic tools available in Drosophila to model\nthe effects of the C96Y mutation, a cysteine to tyrosine mutation in the\ninsulin protein that can cause permanent neonatal diabetes in humans. This\nmutation, which disrupts a disulfide bridge in the proinsulin molecule, has\nbeen shown to lead to partial protein unfolding and aggregation in the\nendoplasmic reticulum. It is thought to induce beta cell death in humans and\nmice through endoplasmic reticulum stress-mediated apoptosis. We employed the\nUAS/GAL4 system to create a stable fly laboratory stock expressing human\ninsulin with the C96Y mutation (INSC96Y) in the Drosophila eye. We crossed\nthese transgenic INSC96Y flies to 36 isogenic lines derived from a wild\npopulation. The F1 flies displayed a disrupted eye development phenotype, with\nboth reduced eye size and irregularity in ommatidia, which varied between lines\nand with sex. By backcrossing F1 offspring to their wild parents, we were able\nto analyze the effects of naturally occurring genetic variation on the INSC96Y\nphenotype in flies both heterozygous and homozygous for wild third chromosomes.\nWe observed significant differences between lines in terms of eye size, eye\nshape, the presence or absence of lesions, and degree of ommatidial structure\npresent, indicating that an approach that takes into account quantitative\nvariation in the genetic background can yield valuable insights into the\nphenotypic severity and penetrance of a complex genetic disease.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Mar 2013 16:09:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-05"}

The second class\ncontains the population genetic models focused on the dynamics of the allele\nfrequencies. The approaches are not fully compatible because the strategic\nmodels disregard the role of the male individuals as the passive carriers of\nthe strategy genes. In the previous two papers in this cycle, a new model\ncombining the strategic analysis with more rigorous genetics was presented. The\nnew model shows that sex ratio self-regulation is a multistage complex process\nwhich can be regarded as an example of multilevel selection. One of the\nelements of this process is the dynamic equilibrium between male and female\ngene carriers associated with convergence of the dynamics to the manifold\ntermed the male subpopulation equilibrium (MSE). This paper attempts to explain\nthis phenomenon and analyze its properties. We show that the MSE phenomenon\naffects every stage of sex ratio self-regulation (Lemmas 1-4). The MSE plays a\ncrucial role in synchronizing two levels of selection in the double-level\nselection process. We show that the MSE condition can be generalized as an\ninteresting synergistic property allowing for the estimation of the primary sex\nratio of the entire population according to the state of some arbitrarily\nchosen subpopulation (Lemma 5). We also show that the classical Dusing Fisher\nShaw Mohler fitness measure is a biased approximation of the new approach, but\nthat it produces compatible strategic predictions (Lemma 6).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Mar 2013 16:49:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 12 Mar 2014 21:17:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-14"}

Since two basic approximations usually taken in the standard\nscenario of quintessence models, that both dark energy density during the\nmatter dominated period and dark energy fluctuations on small scales are\nnegligible, are not valid in such models, we first study approximate analytical\nsolutions for dark matter and dark energy perturbations in the linear regime.\nThis study is helpful to find consistent initial conditions for the system of\nequations and to analytically understand the effects of Early Dark Energy and\nits fluctuations, which are also verified numerically. In the linear regime we\ncompute the matter growth and variation of the gravitational potential\nassociated with the Integrated Sachs-Wolf effect, showing that these\nobservables present important modifications due to Early Dark Energy\nfluctuations, though making them more similar to $\\Lambda$CDM model. We also\nmake use of the Spherical Collapse model to study the influence of Early Dark\nEnergy fluctuations in the nonlinear regime of structure formation, especially\non $\\delta_c$ parameter, and their contribution to the halo mass, which we show\ncan be of the order of 10%. We finally compute how the number density of halos\nis modified in comparison to $\\Lambda$CDM model and address the problem of how\nto correct the mass function in order to take into account the contribution of\nclustered dark energy. We conclude that the inhomogeneous Early Dark Energy\nmodels are more similar to $\\Lambda$CDM model than its homogeneous\ncounterparts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Mar 2013 18:50:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 12 Mar 2014 20:10:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-14"}

The step-size parameters of this algorithm are\ndetermined by only local user access relationship (i.e., the number of users\nserved by each antenna), but do not rely on channel coefficients.

The problem has many\napplications such as verifying the robustness of the networks and controlling\nor improving the entity dissemination. It can be defined as finding a small set\nof topological network modifications which yield a desired closeness centrality\nconfiguration. As a fundamental building block to tackle that problem, we\npropose incremental algorithms which efficiently update the closeness\ncentrality values upon changes in network topology, i.e., edge insertions and\ndeletions.

In addition to closeness\ncentrality, they can also be a great arsenal for the shortest-path-based\nmanagement and analysis of the networks.

A total area of about 5.7 deg$^2$ is covered in the\n$J$, $H$, and $K_S$ bands. We examined the polarization efficiency, defined as\nthe ratio of degree of polarization to color excess. The interstellar medium\nbetween the Galactic center and us shows the polarization efficiency lower than\nthat in the Galactic disk by a factor of three. Moreover we investigated the\nspatial variation of the polarization efficiency by comparing it with those of\ncolor excess, degree of polarization, and position angle. The spatial\nvariations of color excess and degree of polarization depend on the Galactic\nlatitude, while the polarization efficiency varies independently of the\nGalactic structure. Position angles are nearly parallel to the Galactic plane,\nindicating the longitudinal magnetic field configuration between the Galactic\ncenter and us. The polarization efficiency anticorrelates with dispersions of\nposition angles. The low polarization efficiency and its spatial variation can\nbe explained by the differences of the magnetic field directions along the\nline-of-sight. From the lower polarization efficiency, we suggest a higher\nstrength of a random component relative to a uniform component of the magnetic\nfield between the Galactic center and us.

The inflow and outflow of particles move\nalong the magnetic field lines and emit curvature photons, and the incoming\ncurvature photons are converted to pairs by the strong magnetic field of the\nstar. These pairs emit synchrotron photons. We suggest that the X-rays and soft\ngamma-rays of PSR B1509-58 result from the synchrotron radiation of these\npairs, and the viewing angle of PSR B1509-58 only receives the inflow\nradiation. The magnetic pair creation requires a large pitch angle, which makes\nthe pulse profile of the synchrotron radiation distinct from that of the\ncurvature radiation. We carefully trace the pulse profiles of the synchrotron\nradiation with different pitch angles. We find that the differences between the\nlight curves of different energy bands are due to the different pitch angles of\nthe secondary pairs, and the second peak appearing at E>10MeV comes from the\nregion near the star, where the stronger magnetic field allows the pair\ncreation to happen with a smaller pitch angle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Mar 2013 07:14:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-05"}

In contrast to prior\nstudies, thermal fluctuations of the torsional angle between the phenyl rings\nand variations in the position of the molecular level alignment with respect to\nthe electrode Fermi energy were both taken into account. Full thermopower\nhistograms were obtained, and their dependence on the magnitude of the\nfluctuations was studied. We found that at large molecular orbital variations\nthe thermopower becomes strongly dependent on the torsion angle and can even\nchange sign. This results in a marked effect of fluctuations on the thermopower\ndistribution, yielding an average thermopower at high temperatures that differs\n(smaller or larger) from the fluctuation-free value, depending on the strength\nof fluctuations. We therefore conclude that fluctuations should be taken into\naccount both when extracting single-molecule parameters, such as the molecular\nlevel-Fermi level offset, and in predictions of the thermopower of molecular\njunctions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Mar 2013 11:48:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

In these paper the\ndifferent stages are formed, firstly the document preprocessing is done by\nremoving stop words, stemming is performed using porter stemmer algorithm, word\nnet thesaurus is applied for maintaining relationship between the important\nterms, global unique words, and frequent word sets get generated, Secondly,\ndata matrix is formed, and thirdly terms are extracted from the documents by\nusing term selection approaches tf-idf, tf-df, and tf2 based on their minimum\nthreshold value. Further each and every document terms gets preprocessed, where\nthe frequency of each term within the document is counted for representation.\nThe purpose of this approach is to reduce the attributes and find the effective\nterm selection method using WordNet for better clustering accuracy.

It is shown that a such a system displays much\nricher phenomenology than its static Schwarzschild or Reissner--Nordstrom\ncousins, for example, the rotation generates a near horizon electric field. In\nthe case of an extremal rotating black hole, two phases of the Higgs hair are\npossible: Large black holes exhibit standard hair, with the vortex piercing the\nevent horizon. Small black holes on the other hand, exhibit a flux-expelled\nsolution, with the gauge and scalar field remaining identically in their false\nvacuum state on the event horizon. This solution however is extremely sensitive\nto confirm numerically, and we conjecture that it is unstable due to a\nsupperradiant mechanism similar to the Kerr-adS instability. Finally, we\ncompute the gravitational back reaction of the vortex, which turns out to be\nfar more nuanced than a simple conical deficit. While the string produces a\nconical effect, it is conical with respect to a local co-rotating frame, not\nwith respect to the static frame at infinity.

Main attention\nis paid to the model of the so-called quarter stack with perfectly matched\nlayers (the same unperturbed by disorder impedances, $Z_a=Z_b$, and optical\npath lengths, $n_ad_a=|n_b| d_b$, with $d_a$, $d_b$ being the thicknesses of\nbasic layers).
