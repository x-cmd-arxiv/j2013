In order to accomplish one of the preconditions for the\nasteroseismic modelling of the stars, we aim to derive fundamental parameters\nand individual abundances for a sample of 18 Gamma Dor (GD)/Delta Sct (DSct)\nand 8 SPB/beta Cep candidate stars in the Kepler satellite field of view. We\nuse the spectral synthesis method to model newly obtained, high-resolution\nspectra of 26 stars in order to derive their fundamental parameters and\nindividual abundances. The stars are then placed into the log(Teff)-log(g)\ndiagram and the obtained spectroscopic classification is compared to the\nexisting photometric one. For hot stars, the KIC temperatures appear to be\nsystematically underestimated, in agreement with previous findings. We also\nfind that the temperatures derived from our spectra agree reasonably well with\nthose derived from the SED fitting. According to their position in the\nlog(Teff)-log(g) diagram, two stars are expected GD stars, four stars are\nexpected DSct stars, and four stars are possibly DSct stars at the blue edge of\nthe instability strip. Two stars are confirmed SPB variables, and one star\nfalls into the SPB instability region but its parameters might be biased by\nbinarity. Two of the four stars that fall into the DSct instability region show\nGD-type oscillation in their light curves implying that GD-like oscillations\nare much more common among the DSct stars than is theoretically expected.\nMoreover, one of the stars located at the hot border of the DSct instability\nstrip is classified as DSct-GD hybrid pulsator from its light curve analysis.\nGiven that these findings are fully consistent with recent investigations, we\nconclude that a revision of the GD and DSct instability strips is essential.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Mar 2013 16:02:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

In this context, this work\ncontributes to the multi-scale study of the model iron-chromium alloy and their\nfree surfaces by numerical simulations. This study begins with ab initio\ncalculations of properties related to the mixture of atoms of iron and\nchromium. We highlight complex dependency of the magnetic moments of the\nchromium atoms on their local chemical environment. Surface properties are also\nproving sensitive to magnetism. This is the case of impurity segregation of\nchromium in iron and of their interactions near the surface. In a second step,\nwe construct a simple energy model for high numerical efficiency. It is based\non pair interactions on a rigid lattice to which are given local chemical\nenvironment and temperature dependencies. With this model, we reproduce the ab\ninitio results at zero temperature and experimental results at high\ntemperature. We also deduce the solubility limits at all intermediate\ntemperatures with mean field approximations that we compare to Monte Carlo\nsimulations. The last step of our work is to introduce free surfaces in our\nmodel. We then study the effect of ab initio calculated bulk and surface\nproperties on surface segregation.

While the\nclassical Riemann problem serves as a primary building block in the\nconstruction of many numerical schemes (most notably the Godunov scheme), the\nanalytic study of GRP will lead to an array of GRP schemes, which extend the\nGodunov scheme. Currently there are extensive studies on the second-order GRP\nscheme, which proves to be robust and is capable of resolving complex\nmultidimensional fluid dynamic problems [M. Ben-Artzi and J. Falcovitz,\n\"Generalized Riemann Problems in Computational Fluid Dynamics\", Cambridge\nUniversity Press, 2003]. A more general formulation of the second-order GRP\nsolver is still confined with a class of weakly coupled systems [Numer. Math.\n(2007) 106:369-425]. This paper provides a unified approach for solving the GRP\nin the general context of hyperbolic balance laws, without weakly coupled\nconstraint, towards high order accuracy. The derivation of the second-order GRP\nsolver is more concise compared to those in previous works and the third-order\nquadratic GRP is resolved for the first time. The latter is shown to be\nnecessary through numerical experiments with strong discontinuities. Our method\nrelies heavily on the new treatment of the rarefaction wave by deriving the\nL(Q)-equations, an ODE system capturing the \"evolution\" of the characteristic\nderivatives in x-t space for generalized Riemann invariants.

Proximity to an antiferromagnetic phase suggests that pairing is\nmediated by spin fluctuations, but orbital fluctuations have also been invoked.\nThe former typically favour a pairing state of extended s-wave symmetry with a\ngap that changes sign between electron and hole Fermi surfaces (s+-), while the\nlatter yield a standard s-wave state without sign change (s++). Here we show\nthat applying pressure to KFe2As2 induces a change of pairing state. The\ncritical temperature Tc decreases with pressure initially, and then suddenly\nincreases, above a critical pressure Pc. The constancy of the Hall coefficient\nthrough Pc rules out a change in the Fermi surface. There is compelling\nevidence that the pairing state below Pc is d-wave, from bulk measurements at\nambient pressure. Above Pc, the high sensitivity to disorder argues for a\nparticular kind of s+- state. The change from d-wave to s-wave is likely to\nproceed via an unusual s + id state that breaks time-reversal symmetry.

Given the agreement with simulations, these toy models are useful\nfor understanding the complex phenomena in simple terms and for\nback-of-the-envelope predictions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Mar 2013 20:00:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 May 2013 14:50:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

The study of Li in stars of open clusters\n(hereafter OC) allows a detailed comparison with stellar evolutionary models\nand permits us to trace its galactic evolution. The OC NGC 2243 is particularly\ninteresting because of its low metallicity ([Fe/H]=$-0.54 \\pm0.10$ dex). We\nmeasure the iron and lithium abundance in stars of the metal-poor OC NGC 2243.\nThe first aim is to determine whether the Li dip extends to such low\nmetallicities, the second is to compare the results of our Li analysis in this\nOC with those present in 47 Tuc, a globular cluster of similar metallicity. We\nperformed a detailed analysis of high-resolution spectra obtained with the\nmulti-object facility FLAMES at the ESO VLT 8.2m telescope. Lithium abundance\nwas derived through line equivalent widths and the OSMARCS atmosphere models.\nWe determine a Li dip center of 1.06 $M_\\odot$, which is much smaller than that\nobserved in solar metallicity and metal-rich clusters. This finding confirms\nand strengthens the conclusion that the mass of the stars in the Li dip\nstrongly depends on stellar metallicity. The mean Li abundance of the cluster\nis $\\log n{\\rm (Li)}=2.70$ dex, which is substantially higher than that\nobserved in 47 Tuc. We estimated an iron abundance of [Fe/H]=$-0.54 \\pm0.10$\ndex for NGC 2243, which is similar (within the errors) to previous findings.\nThe [$ \\alpha$/Fe] content ranges from $0.00\\pm0.14$ for Ca to $0.20\\pm0.22$\nfor Ti, which is low when compared to thick disk stars and to Pop II stars, but\ncompatible with thin disk objects.

Here we present experimental evidence and\nquantitative analysis of simultaneous development of significant elastic\ndeformation and dislocation-based plastic deformation in single crystal GaAs\nnanowires (NWs) under bending deformation up to a total strain of ~ 6%. The\nobservation is in sharp contrast to the previous notions regarding the\ndeformation modes. Most of the plastic deformation recovers spontaneously when\nthe external stress is released, and therefore resembles an elastic deformation\nprocess.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Mar 2013 21:55:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-14"}

In this paper, using a\ngeneralized moving least squares (GMLS) approximation, a new direct MLPG\ntechnique, called DMLPG, is presented. Following the principle of meshless\nmethods to express everything \"entirely in terms of nodes\", the generalized MLS\nrecovers test functionals directly from values at nodes, without any detour via\nshape functions. This leads to a cheaper and even more accurate scheme. In\nparticular, the complete absence of shape functions allows numerical\nintegrations in the weak forms of the problem to be done over low{degree\npolynomials instead of complicated shape functions. Hence, the standard MLS\nshape function subroutines are not called at all. Numerical examples illustrate\nthe superiority of the new technique over the classical MLPG.

The main source for nearby GRBs for all\nthree time intervals is the globular cluster 47 Tuc, a consequence of its large\nmass and high stellar encounter rate, as well as the fact that it is one of the\nglobular clusters which comes quite close to the Sun. Mass extinction events\nindeed coincide with all three time intervals found in this study, although a\nchance coincidence is quite likely. Nevertheless, the identified time intervals\ncan be used as a guide to search for specific signatures of GRBs in the\ngeological record around these times.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Mar 2013 08:04:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

We consider in detail two\ndifferent scaling limits of the PD metric. The first of these limits removes\nthe acceleration parameter, and leads to the Carter-Plebanski solution. In this\ncase, the integrability conditions for Killing spinors were obtained by\nAlonso-Alberca, Meessen and Ortin in hep-th/0003071, and we show that these are\nnot only necessary, but also sufficient for the existence of Killing spinors.\nThis fills also a gap in hep-th/9808097, where the integrability conditions for\nsupersymmetry of the Kerr-Newman-AdS black hole were worked out, but the\nKilling spinor was not constructed explicitely. The second scaling limit\neliminates the rotation parameter, and leads to the cosmological C-metric,\nwhich describes accelerated black holes in AdS. Also in this case, the\nsupersymmetry conditions are obtained, and it is shown that they follow from\nthe ones of the general PD solution by scaling the parameters appropriately. In\nall cases, we determine the three-dimensional base space that appears in the\nclassification scheme of hep-th/0307022, and prove that for the\n1/2-supersymmetric Reissner-Nordstrom-AdS spacetime, this base is unique.

In this paper, we propose\na model-free criterion ESCV based on a new estimation stability (ES) metric and\nCV. Our proposed ESCV finds a locally ES-optimal model smaller than the CV\nchoice so that the it fits the data and also enjoys estimation stability\nproperty. We demonstrate that ESCV is an effective alternative to CV at a\nsimilar easily parallelizable computational cost. In particular, we compare the\ntwo approaches with respect to several performance measures when applied to the\nLasso on both simulated and real data sets. For dependent predictors common in\npractice, our main finding is that, ESCV cuts down false positive rates often\nby a large margin, while sacrificing little of true positive rates. ESCV\nusually outperforms CV in terms of parameter estimation while giving similar\nperformance as CV in terms of prediction.

IGR J12319-0749 (J1231-0747) is a compact radio source, practically\nunresolved on interferometric baselines up to ~136 million wavelengths. The\nestimated brightness temperature (at least ~2 x 10^12 K) indicates that the\nradio emission of its jet is Doppler-boosted. The accurate position of the\ncompact radio source is consistent with the positions measured at higher\nenergies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Mar 2013 11:29:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-16"}

But at least some parts of that\nconstruction can usefully be extended to give meaningful results for arbitrary\nbifurcate null surfaces. As presaged in Jacobson's original article, this more\ngeneral construction sharply brings into focus the questions: Is entropy\nobjectively \"real\"? Or is entropy in some sense subjective and\nobserver-dependent?\n  These innocent questions open a Pandora's box of often inconclusive debate. A\nconsensus opinion, though certainly not universally held, seems to be that\nClausius entropy (thermodynamic entropy, defined via a Clausius relation dS =\ndQ/T) should be objectively real, but that the ontological status of\nstatistical entropy (Shannon or von Neumann entropy) is much more ambiguous,\nand much more likely to be observer-dependent. This question is particularly\npressing when it comes to understanding Bekenstein entropy (black hole\nentropy). To perhaps further add to the confusion, we shall argue that even the\nClausius entropy can often be observer-dependent. In the current article we\nshall conclusively demonstrate that one can meaningfully assign a notion of\nClausius entropy to arbitrary bifurcate null surfaces --- effectively defining\na \"virtual Clausius entropy\" for arbitrary \"virtual (local) causal horizons\".\n  As an application, we see that we can implement a version of the generalized\nsecond law (GSL) for this virtual Clausius entropy. This version of GSL can be\nrelated to certain (nonstandard) integral variants of the null energy condition\n(NEC). Because the concepts involved are rather subtle, we take some effort in\nbeing careful and explicit in developing our framework. In future work we will\napply this construction to generalize Jacobson's derivation of the Einstein\nequations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Mar 2013 15:12:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Apr 2013 11:49:17 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 6 Dec 2013 02:00:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-29"}

In particular, machine\nlearning - one of the foundational disciplines for data analysis, summarization\nand inference - on Big Data has become routine at most organizations that\noperate large clouds, usually based on systems such as Hadoop that support the\nMapReduce programming paradigm. It is now widely recognized that while\nMapReduce is highly scalable, it suffers from a critical weakness for machine\nlearning: it does not support iteration. Consequently, one has to program\naround this limitation, leading to fragile, inefficient code. Further, reliance\non the programmer is inherently flawed in a multi-tenanted cloud environment,\nsince the programmer does not have visibility into the state of the system when\nhis or her program executes. Prior work has sought to address this problem by\neither developing specialized systems aimed at stylized applications, or by\naugmenting MapReduce with ad hoc support for saving state across iterations\n(driven by an external loop). In this paper, we advocate support for looping as\na first-class construct, and propose an extension of the MapReduce programming\nparadigm called {\\em Iterative MapReduce}.

At any time, a human\nreasoner in a large domain may direct his attention to only one of a number of\nnatural subdomains, i.e., there is ?localization' of queries and evidence. In\nsuch a case, propagating evidence through a homogeneous network is inefficient\nsince the entire network has to be updated each time. This paper presents\nmultiply sectioned Bayesian networks that enable a (localization preserving)\nrepresentation of natural subdomains by separate Bayesian subnets. The subnets\nare transformed into a set of permanent junction trees such that evidential\nreasoning takes place at only one of them at a time. Probabilities obtained are\nidentical to those that would be obtained from the homogeneous network. We\ndiscuss attention shift to a different junction tree and propagation of\npreviously acquired evidence. Although the overall system can be large,\ncomputational requirements are governed by the size of only one junction tree.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Mar 2013 12:56:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-25"}

The proposed calculus\nuses a weighting factor whose role is similar to the probabilistic\ninterpretation of an assumption that disambiguates decision problems\nrepresented with belief functions (Strat 1990). It will be shown that with the\npresented calculus, if the decision problems are represented in the valuation\nnetwork properly, we can solve the problems by using fusion algorithm (Shenoy\n1991a).

When the underlying graph of a\nBayesian net is triangulated, this approach arranges its cliques into a tree\nand computes posterior probabilities by appropriately passing around messages\nin that tree. The computation in each clique is simply direct marginalization.\nWhen the underlying graph is not triangulated, one has to first triangulated it\nby adding edges. Referred to as the triangulation problem, the problem of\nfinding an optimal or even a ?good? triangulation proves to be difficult. In\nthis paper, we propose to first decompose a Bayesian net into smaller\ncomponents by making use of Tarjan's algorithm for decomposing an undirected\ngraph at all its minimal complete separators. Then, the components are arranged\ninto a tree and posterior probabilities are computed by appropriately passing\naround messages in that tree.
