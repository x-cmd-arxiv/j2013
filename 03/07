Valuable information on the physics of LBV eruptions can be gained\nby analyzing the spectral evolution during this eruption and by comparing R71's\npresent appearance to its previous outburst and its quiescent state. Here we\npresent the first spectra of an ongoing monitoring program with VLT/X-shooter\nand compare them to archival VLT/UVES and MPG/ESO-2.2m/FEROS spectra from\n2002-2011. The discussed data include pre-eruption spectra in 2002 and 2005, a\nspectrum of the transitionary phase between quiescent and eruptive state in\n2007, and spectra of the eruption in 2011-2012. The 2011-2012 spectra are\ndominated by strong neutral and singly ionized metal absorption lines likely\nformed in a large \"pseudo-photosphere.\" We find an unusually low apparent\ntemperature of R71 of only ~6650 K; the star resembles a late F supergiant.\nR71's visual lightcurve had a maximum in 2012 with mV ~ 8.7 mag. Given the\nuncertainty in the extinction towards R71, this corresponds to a bolometric\nluminosity of -9.8 mag to -10.3 mag. R71's 2011-2012 spectra do not show H I\nand Fe II P Cyg profiles, which were present during its last outburst in the\n1970s and which are normally observed during LBV outbursts. The rise in R71's\nvisual magnitude and the low apparent temperature of its pseudo-photosphere\nduring the current eruption are unprecedented for this star. R71 most likely\nincreased its bolometric luminosity by 0.4-1.3 mag compared to its quiescent\nstate. The very low temperature of its pseudo-photosphere implies a very\nhigh-mass loss rate, a factor of 1000 higher than during the quiescence state.\nNo fast-moving material indicative of an explosion is observed (abridged).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Mar 2013 16:15:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

To study\ndifferences in the resulting coronal emission we employ 1D loop models with a\nprescribed heat input based on the heating rate we extracted along a bundle of\nfield lines. On average, all heating implementations show a roughly drop of the\nheating rate with height. This also holds for individual field lines. While all\nmechanism show a concentration of the energy input towards the low parts of the\natmosphere, for individual field lines the concentration towards the footpoints\nis much stronger for the DC mechanisms than for the Alfven wave AC case. In\ncontrast, the AC model gives a stronger concentration of the emission towards\nthe footpoints. This is because the more homogeneous distribution of the energy\ninput leads to higher coronal temperatures and a more extended transition\nregion. The significant difference in the concentration of the heat input\ntowards the foot points for the AC and DC mechanisms, and the pointed\ndifference in the spatial distribution of the coronal emission for these cases\nshows that the two mechanisms should be discriminable by observations.

We explore the effects of\nrecombination and migration on the maintenance of multilocus polymorphism, on\nlocal adaptation, and on differentiation by employing a deterministic model\nwith genic selection on two linked diallelic loci (i.e., no dominance or\nepistasis). For the following cases, we characterize explicitly the possible\nequilibrium configurations: weak, strong, highly asymmetric, and\nsuper-symmetric migration, no or weak recombination, and independent or\nstrongly recombining loci. For independent loci (linkage equilibrium) and for\ncompletely linked loci, we derive the possible bifurcation patterns as\nfunctions of the total migration rate, assuming all other parameters are fixed\nbut arbitrary. For these and other cases, we determine analytically the maximum\nmigration rate below which a stable fully polymorphic equilibrium exists. In\nthis case, differentiation and local adaptation are maintained. Their degree is\nquantified by a new multilocus version of $\\Fst$ and by the migration load,\nrespectively. In addition, we investigate the invasion conditions of locally\nbeneficial mutants and show that linkage to a locus that is already in\nmigration-selection balance facilitates invasion. Hence, loci of much smaller\neffect can invade than predicted by one-locus theory if linkage is sufficiently\ntight. We study how this minimum amount of linkage admitting invasion depends\non the migration pattern. This suggests the emergence of clusters of locally\nbeneficial mutations, which may form `genomic islands of divergence'. Finally,\nthe influence of linkage and two-way migration on the effective migration rate\nat a linked neutral locus is explored.

The standard cosmological interpretation of \"acoustic\" peaks is just a\nparticular case; peaks in the power spectrum might be generated in scenarios\nwithin some alternative cosmological model that have nothing to do with\noscillations due to gravitational compression in a fluid.\n  We also calculate the angular correlation function of the anisotropies from\nthe WMAP-7yr and ACT data, in an attempt to derive the minimum number of\nparameters a polynomial function should have to fit it: a set of polynomial\nfunctions with a total of six free parameters, apart from the amplitude, is\nenough to reproduce the first two peaks.

Many simulations of radiative shocks, both in the contexts of\nastrophysics and laboratory experiments, use a grey treatment of radiative\ntransfer coupled to the hydrodynamics. However, the opacities of the gas show\nlarge variations as a function of frequency and this needs to be taken into\naccount if one wishes to reproduce the relevant physics. We have performed\nradiation hydrodynamics simulations of radiative shocks in Ar using multigroup\n(frequency dependent) radiative transfer with the HERACLES code. The opacities\nwere taken from the ODALISC database. We show the influence of the number of\nfrequency groups used on the dynamics and morphologies of subcritical and\nsupercritical radiative shocks in Ar gas, and in particular on the extent of\nthe radiative precursor. We find that simulations with even a low number of\ngroups show significant differences compared to single-group (grey)\nsimulations, and that in order to correctly model such shocks, a minimum number\nof groups is required. Results appear to eventually converge as the number of\ngroups increases above 50. We were also able to resolve in our simulations of\nsupercritical shocks the adaptation zones which connect the cooling layer to\nthe final post-shock state and the precursor. Inside these adaptation zones, we\nfind that the radiative flux just ahead of the shock in one or several\nhigh-opacity groups can heat the gas to a temperature higher than the\npost-shock temperature. Through the use of Hugoniot curves, we have checked the\nconsistency of our radiation hydrodynamics scheme by showing that conservation\nof mass, momentum and energy (including radiative flux) holds.

According to these calculations flocculation and coalescence\nare predominant during the first few seconds after the preparation of the\nemulsion. This favors the generation of a right-skewed Drop Size Distribu- tion\n(DSD). As the system evolves, the drops grow larger and more repulsive causing\na slow down of the flocculation process. In the case of dodecane (C12) and\nhexadecane (C16) the referred phenomena, reinforce the ripening trend to\nsubvert the initial DSD variation, producing a meta-stable distribution which\nis preserved during several minutes. After this time, Ostwald ripening\ndominates: the skirt of the distribution changes progressively from\nright-skewed to left-skewed. Consistent with these changes, the cube average\nradius of the emulsion increases rapidly at first, but progressively diminishes\ngenerating a concave-downward curve that stabilizes asymptotically. In the case\nof dodecane and hexadecane the complete dissolution of the drops promoted by\nripening is prevented at all times due to coalescence. In the case of octane\n(C8) a substantial amount of drops is lost by dissolution, forbidding the\nattain- ment of a stable DSD.

The new framework allows for the\nmodelling of populations consisting of competing strategies carried by\nindividuals who change across their life cycle. Firstly the discretization of\nthe McKendrick von Foerster model is derived. It is shown that the Euler--Lotka\nequation is satisfied when the new model reaches a steady state (i.e. stable\nfrequencies between the age classes). This discretization consists of the unit\nage classes and the timescale is chosen that only a fraction of individuals\nplay single game round. This implies linear dynamics within single time unit\nwhen individuals not killed during game round are moved from one age class to\nanother. Since its local linear behaviour the system is equivalent to large\nBernadelli-Lewis-Leslie matrix. Then the methodology of multipopulation games\nis used for the derivation of two, mutually equivalent systems of equations.\nThe first contains equations describing the evolution of the strategy\nfrequencies in the whole population completed by subsystems of equations\ndescribing the evolution of the age structure for each strategy. The second\nsystem contains equations describing the changes of the general population's\nage structure, completed with subsystems of equations describing the selection\nof the strategies within each age class. Then the obtained system of replicator\ndynamics is presented in the form of the mixed ODE-PDE system. The obtained\nresults are illustrated by example of the sex ratio model which shows that when\ndifferent mortalities of both sexes are assumed, the sex ratio of 0.5 is\nobtained but that Fisher's mechanism driven by the reproductive value of the\ndifferent sexes is not in equilibrium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Mar 2013 19:23:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 Apr 2020 21:02:26 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 31 Aug 2020 16:46:46 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 31 Mar 2021 16:17:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-01"}

In their pristine state, most CCD pixels are `cool';\nthey exhibit low, quasi uniform dark current, which can be estimated and\ncorrected for. In space, after having been hit by an energetic particle, pixels\ncan turn `hot'. They start delivering excessive, less predictable, dark\ncurrent. The hot pixels need therefore to be flagged so that subsequent\nanalysis may ignore them. The image data of the PICARD SODISM solar telescope\n(Meftah et al. 2013) require dark signal correction and hot pixel\nidentification. Its frame transfer E2V 42-80 CCD operates at -7{\\deg}C. Both\nimage and memory zones thus accumulate dark current during, respectively,\nintegration and readout time. These two components must be separated to\nestimate the dark signal for any observation. This is the purpose of the Dark\nSignal Model presented in this paper. The dark signal time series of every\npixel is processed by the Unbalanced Haar Technique (Fryzlewicz 2007) in order\nto timestamp when its dark signal is expected to change. In-between those\ninstants, both components are assumed constant and a robust linear regression\nvs. integration time provides first estimates and a quality coefficient. The\nlatter serves to assign definitive estimates. Our model is part of the SODISM\nLevel 1 data production scheme. To check its reliability, we verify on dark\nframes that it leaves a negligible residual bias (5 e-), and generates a small\nRMS error (25 e- rms). The cool pixel level is found to be 4 e-/pxl/s, in\nagreement with the predicted value. The emergence rate of hot pixels is\ninvestigated too. It legitimates a threshold criterion at 50 e-/pxl/s. The\ngrowth rate is found to be 4% of the frame area per year. Aspects of the method\n(adaptation of the Unbalanced Haar Technique, dedicated robust linear\nregression) have a generic interest.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Mar 2013 19:57:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

It is well established that these new fields may\nmodify Higgs gamma-gamma and gamma-Z decays at one-loop. However, one\nunexplored aspect of such scenarios is that by electroweak symmetry one should\nalso expect modifications to the Higgs Z-Z coupling at one-loop and, more\ngenerally, modifications to Higgs production and decay channels beyond\ntree-level. In this paper we investigate the full BSM modified electroweak\ncorrections to associated Higgs production at both the LHC and a future lepton\ncollider in two simple SM extensions. From both inclusive and differential NLO\nassociated production cross sections we find BSM-NLO corrections can be as\nlarge as O(>10%) when compared to the SM expectation, consistent with other\nprecision electroweak measurements, even in scenarios where modifications to\nthe Higgs diphoton rate are not significant. At the LHC such corrections are\ncomparable to the involved QCD uncertainties. At a lepton collider the Higgs\nassociated production cross section can be measured to high accuracy (O(1%)\nindependent of uncertainties in total width and other couplings), and such a\ndeviation could be easily observed even if the new states remain beyond\nkinematic reach.

We begin by\nintroducing the concept of holographically conjugate variables (HCVs) in terms\nof which the surface term in the action has a specific relationship with the\nbulk term. In addition to g_{ab} and its conjugate momentum \\sqrt{-g} M^{cab},\nthis procedure allows us to (re)discover and motivate strongly the use of\nf^{ab}=\\sqrt{-g}g^{ab} and its conjugate momentum N^c_{ab}.

This mixing has the important qualitative effect of\nbreaking particle-hole symmetry as well as renormalizing the strength of the\ninterparticle interactions. Both effects could have important consequences for\nthe prospect that the fractional quantum Hall effect at $\\nu=5/2$ is described\nby states that support non-Abelian excitations such as the Moore-Read Pfaffian\nor anti-Pfaffian states. For GaAs, Landau level and subband mixing break\nparticle-hole symmetry in all Landau levels and subband mixing, due to finite\nthickness, causes additional short-distance softening of the Coulomb\ninteraction, further renormalizing the Hamiltonian; additionally, the Landau\nlevel and subband energy spacings are comparable so it is crucial to consider\nboth effects simultaneously. We find that in graphene, Landau level mixing only\nbreaks particle-hole symmetry outside of the lowest Landau level ($N\\neq0$).\nLandau level mixing is likely to be especially important in graphene since the\nLandau level mixing parameter is independent of the external magnetic field and\nis of order one.

Most of the energy flux is carried by the radiation field and the\ntoroidal magnetic field that is wound up close to the rapidly rotating engine.\nAlthough the entrained matter carries little energy, it couples the radiation\nfield to the magnetic field. Then the fast critical point is pushed inward from\ninfinity and, above a critical radiation intensity, the outflow is accelerated\nmainly by radiation pressure. We identify a distinct observational signature of\nthis hybrid outflow: a hardening of the radiation spectrum above the peak of\nthe seed photon distribution, driven by bulk Compton scattering. The\nnon-thermal spectrum -- obtained by a Monte Carlo method -- is most extended\nwhen the Lorentz force dominates the acceleration, and the seed photon beam is\nwider than the Lorentz cone of the MHD fluid.

In 7 cases the young stellar population is clearly\ndisplaced from the main body of the galaxies. Half of our targets show\nabsorption spectra with post-starburst signatures. The scale lengths in H-alpha\nare typically 30% smaller than those of the stellar continua, indicating ram\npressure stripping. We tentatively identify a few conditions favourable for\nleakage: 1) the combined effects of ram pressure stripping with supernova winds\nfrom young stars formed in the front, 2) merger events that increase the star\nformation rate and displace stars from gas, 3) starbursts in the centres of\npost-starburst galaxies, and 4) a low dust content.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Mar 2013 00:04:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

The spin of a black hole of known mass and distance can be\nmeasured by fitting this thermal continuum spectrum to the thin-disk model of\nNovikov and Thorne; the key fit parameter is the radius of the inner edge of\nthe black hole's accretion disk. Strong observational and theoretical evidence\nlinks the inner-disk radius to the radius of the innermost stable circular\norbit, which is trivially related to the dimensionless spin parameter a_* of\nthe black hole (|a_*| < 1). The ten spins that have so far been measured by\nthis continuum-fitting method range widely from a_* \\approx 0 to a_* > 0.95.\nThe robustness of the method is demonstrated by the dozens or hundreds of\nindependent and consistent measurements of spin that have been obtained for\nseveral black holes, and through careful consideration of many sources of\nsystematic error.

In this paper, we consider the problem of identifying similar\nportions between a pair of trajectories, each observed as a sequence of points\nsampled from it.\n  We present new measures of trajectory similarity --- both local and global\n--- between a pair of trajectories to distinguish between similar and\ndissimilar portions. Our model is robust under noise and outliers, it does not\nmake any assumptions on the sampling rates on either trajectory, and it works\neven if they are partially observed. Additionally, the model also yields a\nscalar similarity score which can be used to rank multiple pairs of\ntrajectories according to similarity, e.g. in clustering applications.

We investigate this interpretation, by dissecting the various\nparameters from which the column density is derived, and find that the\nrelationship is driven primarily by the observed optical depth, which, for a\ngiven absorber size, is anti-correlated with the linear size. Therefore, the\ninferred anti-correlation is merely the consequence of geometry, in conjunction\nwith the assumption of a common spin temperature/covering factor ratio for each\nmember of the sample, an assumption for which there is scant observational\njustification. While geometry can explain the observed correlation, many radio\nsources comprise two radio lobes and so we model the projected area of a two\ncomponent emitter intercepted by a foreground absorber.

Here, it is shown that this\npractice, which has been widely used in the past three decades or so, is\nphysically wrong for at least two reasons, and that it should be corrected. One\nreason is that the elastic stress tensor sigma is not symmetric while dot{E) is\nsymmetric, so that motions for which sigma + sigma^T <> 0 will give rise to\nelastic stresses which have no viscous pendant. Another reason is that dot{E}\nis frame-invariant, while sigma is not, so that an observer transformation\nwould alter the elastic part of the total stress differently than it would\nalter the dissipative part, thereby violating the fundamental principle of\nmaterial frame-indifference.

Most of the relevant\nliterature focuses on holistic descriptors in closed-set identification\napplications. The underlying assumption in SR-based methods is that each class\nin the gallery has sufficient samples and the query lies on the subspace\nspanned by the gallery of the same class. Unfortunately, such assumption is\neasily violated in the more challenging face verification scenario, where an\nalgorithm is required to determine if two faces (where one or both have not\nbeen seen before) belong to the same person. In this paper, we first discuss\nwhy previous attempts with SR might not be applicable to verification problems.\nWe then propose an alternative approach to face verification via SR.\nSpecifically, we propose to use explicit SR encoding on local image patches\nrather than the entire face. The obtained sparse signals are pooled via\naveraging to form multiple region descriptors, which are then concatenated to\nform an overall face descriptor. Due to the deliberate loss spatial relations\nwithin each region (caused by averaging), the resulting descriptor is robust to\nmisalignment & various image deformations. Within the proposed framework, we\nevaluate several SR encoding techniques: l1-minimisation, Sparse Autoencoder\nNeural Network (SANN), and an implicit probabilistic technique based on\nGaussian Mixture Models. Thorough experiments on AR, FERET, exYaleB, BANCA and\nChokePoint datasets show that the proposed local SR approach obtains\nconsiderably better and more robust performance than several previous\nstate-of-the-art holistic SR methods, in both verification and closed-set\nidentification problems. The experiments also show that l1-minimisation based\nencoding has a considerably higher computational than the other techniques, but\nleads to higher recognition rates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Mar 2013 09:30:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-19"}

In the TeV range, a photon index of 3.89 +-\n0.37 (stat) +- 0.22 (sys) and a flux normalisation at 1 TeV, Phi(1 TeV) = (3.5\n+- 1.1 (stat) +- 0.9 (sys)) x 10^{-13} cm^{-2} s^{-1} TeV^{-1}, were found. The\ndetection with H.E.S.S. triggered observations in the X-ray band with the Swift\nand RXTE telescopes. Simultaneous UV and optical data from Swift UVOT and data\nfrom the optical telescopes ATOM and ROTSE are also available. The spectrum and\nlight curve measured with H.E.S.S. are presented and compared to the\nmulti-wavelength data at lower energies. A rapid flare is seen in the Swift XRT\nand RXTE data, together with a flux variation in the UV band, at a time scale\nof the order of one day. A firm upper limit of z < 0.59 on the redshift of PKS\n0447-439 is derived from the combined Fermi-LAT and H.E.S.S. data, given the\nassumptions that there is no upturn in the intrinsic spectrum above the\nFermi-LAT energy range and that absorption on the Extragalactic Background\nLight (EBL) is not weaker than the lower limit provided by current models.

Variants of both formats find applications ranging from the allocation of\nstate bonds to investors, to online sales over the internet, facilitated by\npopular online brokers. For these formats, we consider two bidding interfaces:\n(i) standard bidding, which is most prevalent in the scientific literature, and\n(ii) uniform bidding, which is more popular in practice. In this work, we\nevaluate the economic inefficiency of both multi-unit auction formats for both\nbidding interfaces, by means of upper and lower bounds on the Price of Anarchy\nfor pure Nash equilibria and mixed Bayes-Nash equilibria. Our developments\nimprove significantly upon bounds that have been obtained recently in\n[Markakis, Telelis, ToCS 2014] and [Syrgkanis, Tardos, STOC 2013] for\nsubmodular valuation functions.

In such scenarios, the relay that is\npreferable for information transmission does not necessarily coincide with the\nrelay with the strongest channel to the energy harvester, since the\ncorresponding channels fade independently. Relay selection thus entails a\ntradeoff between the efficiency of the information transfer to the receiver and\nthe amount of energy transferred to the energy harvester. The study of this\ntradeoff is the subject on which this work mainly focuses. Specifically, we\ninvestigate the behavior of the ergodic capacity and the outage probability of\nthe information transmission to the receiver, for a given amount of energy\ntransferred to the RF energy harvester. We propose two relay selection methods\nthat apply to any number of available relays. Furthermore, for the case of two\nrelays, we develop the optimal relay selection method in a maximum capacity /\nminimum outage probability sense, for a given energy transfer constraint. A\nclose-to-optimal selection method that is easier to analyze than the optimal\none is also examined.

The latter have an energy on the scale of the\non-site Hubbard repulsion $U$ in the dilute limit but becomes soft at the\nBrinkman-Rice transition which is shown to be related to an emerging\nconservation law of doublon charge and the associated gauge invariance.\nCoupling with the boson mode produces structure in the charge response and we\nfind that a similar structure appears in dynamical mean-field theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Mar 2013 12:42:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 May 2013 12:00:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

It is reproduced by covering the very\nbright accretion disk by the secondary component. The luminosity of the disk is\nmuch bigger than that of the rest light sources. The determined high\ntemperature of the disk is typical for that observed during the outbursts of\nCVs. The primary of 2MASS J01074282+4845188 is one of the hottest white dwarfs\nin CVs. The temperature of 5090 K of its secondary is also quite high and more\nappropriate for a long-period SW Sex star. It might be explained by the intense\nheating from the hot white dwarf and the hot accretion disk of the target. The\nhigh mass accretion rate $\\dot{M} = 8\\times 10^{-9} M_{\\sun}$ yr$^{-1}$, the\nbroad and single-peaked H$\\alpha$ emission profile, and the presence of an\nS-wave are sure signs for the SW Sex classification of 2MASS J01074282+4845188.\nThe obtained flat temperature distribution along the disk radius as well as the\ndeviation of the energy distribution from the black-body law are evidence of\nthe non-steady emission of the disk.

We detected H$_2$O maser\nemission toward the radio jet in VLA 1 and the expanding shell-like structure\nin VLA 2. We have made elliptical fits to the VLA 2 H$_2$O maser shell-like\nstructure observed in the different epochs (1999, 2005, and 2007), and found\nthat the shell is still expanding eight years after its discovery. From the\ndifference in the size of the semi-major axes of the fitted ellipses in the\nepochs 1999 ($\\simeq$ 71$\\pm$1 mas), 2005 ($\\simeq$ 97$\\pm$3 mas), and 2007\n($\\simeq$ 111$\\pm$1 mas), we estimate an average expanding velocity of $\\sim$ 5\nmas yr$^{-1}$, similar to the proper motions measured in the individual H$_2$O\nmaser features. A kinematic age of $\\sim$ 20 yr is derived for this structure.\nIn addition, our VERA observations indicate an increase in the ellipticity of\nthe expanding shell around VLA 2 from epochs 1999 to 2007. In fact, the\nelliptical fit of the VERA data shows a ratio between the minor and major axes\nof $\\sim$ 0.6, in contrast with a most circular shape for the shell detected in\n1999 and 2005 (b/a $\\sim$ 0.9). This suggests that we are probably observing\nthe formation of a jet-driven H$_2$O maser structure in VLA2, evolving from a\nnon-collimated pulsed-outflow event during the first stages of evolution of a\nmassive young stellar object (YSO). This may support predictions made earlier\nby other authors on this issue, consistent with recent magnetohydrodynamical\nsimulations.

Case Based Reasoning (CBR) is an emerg- ing decision making\nparadigm in medical research where new cases are solved relying on previously\nsolved similar cases. Usually, a database of solved cases is provided, and\nevery case is described through a set of attributes (inputs) and a label\n(output). Extracting useful information from this database can help the CBR\nsystem providing more reliable results on the yet to be solved cases.\nObjective. For that purpose we suggest a general frame- work where a CBR\nsystem, viz. K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN) algorithm, is combined with various\ninformation obtained from a Logistic Regression (LR) model. Methods. LR is\napplied, on the case database, to assign weights to the attributes as well as\nthe solved cases. Thus, five possible decision making systems based on K-NN\nand/or LR were identified: a standalone K-NN, a standalone LR and three soft\nK-NN algorithms that rely on the weights based on the results of the LR. The\nevaluation of the described approaches is performed in the field of renal\ntransplant access waiting list. Results and conclusion. The results show that\nour suggested approach, where the K-NN algorithm relies on both weighted\nattributes and cases, can efficiently deal with non relevant attributes,\nwhereas the four other approaches suffer from this kind of noisy setups.

We derive analytical expressions of the distribution and relate\nits properties to an anisotropy measure based on the mean diffusivity and the\nasymptotic decay of the distribution. Both quantities are easy to determine\nfrom experimental data and reveal the existence of more than one diffusion\ncoefficient, which allows the distinction between isotropic and anisotropic\nprocesses. We further discuss the influence on the analysis of projected\ntrajectories, which are typically accessible in experiments. For the\nexperimentally relevant cases of two- and three-dimensional anisotropic\ndiffusion we derive specific expressions, determine the diffusion tensor,\ncharacterize the anisotropy, and demonstrate the applicability for simulated\ntrajectories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Mar 2013 14:34:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 23 Aug 2013 14:01:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-14"}

The charge is accumulated since the\ndegeneracies of occupied lowest Landau levels for particles of positive isospin\nand anti-particles of negative isospin are different.

Our bringing concerns critical layers, a process poorly explored in\nstellar physics, defined as the location where the local relative frequency of\na given wave to the rotational frequency of the fluid tends to zero (i.e that\ncorresponds to co-rotation resonances). IGW propagate through stably-stratified\nradiative regions, where they extract or deposit angular momentum through two\nprocesses: radiative and viscous dampings and critical layers.

First, we expose a\nmathematical resolution of the equation of propagation for IGWs in adiabatic\nand non-adiabatic cases near critical layers.

Two more powerful reducibilities--bounded\ntruth-table and Turing CFL-reducibilities--are also discussed in comparison.\nThe Turing CFL-reducibility, in particular, helps us introduce an exquisite\nhierarchy, called the CFL hierarchy, built over the family CFL of context-free\nlanguages.

To explore the possibility that observed\nstructures emerge spontaneously as a collective result of many dunes\ninteracting with each other, we built a numerical model that treats barchans as\ndiscrete entities that interact with one another according to simplified rules\nderived from theoretical and numerical work and from field observations: (1)\nDunes exchange sand through the fluxes that leak from the downwind side of each\ndune and are captured on their upstream sides; (2) when dunes become\nsufficiently large, small dunes are born on their downwind sides (`calving');\nand (3) when dunes collide directly enough, they merge. Results show that these\nrelatively simple interactions provide potential explanations for a range of\nfield-scale phenomena including isolated patches of dunes and heterogeneous\narrangements of similarly sized dunes in denser fields.

Stereoisomerism is of great importance in many\ndifferent fields since the molecular properties and biological effects of the\nstereoisomers are often significantly different. Most drugs for example, are\noften composed of a single stereoisomer of a compound, and while one of them\nmay have therapeutic effects on the body, another may be toxic. A challenging\ntask is the automatic detection of stereoisomers using line input\nspecifications such as SMILES or InChI since it requires information about\ngroup theory (to distinguish stereoisomers using mathematical information about\nits symmetry), topology and geometry of the molecule. There are several\nsoftware packages that include modules to handle stereochemistry, especially\nthe ones to name a chemical structure and/or view, edit and generate chemical\nstructure diagrams. However, there is a lack of software capable of\nautomatically analyzing a molecule represented as a graph and generate a\nclassification of the type of isomerism present in a given atom or bond.\nConsidering the importance of stereoisomerism when comparing chemical\nstructures, this report describes a computer program for analyzing and\nprocessing steric information contained in a chemical structure represented as\na molecular graph and providing as output a binary classification of the isomer\ntype based on the recommended conventions. Due to the complexity of the\nunderlying issue, specification of stereochemical information is currently\nlimited to explicit stereochemistry and to the two most common types of\nstereochemistry caused by asymmetry around carbon atoms: chiral atom and double\nbond.
