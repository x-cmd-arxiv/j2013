Similarity\nmeasure is a function that assigns a real number between 0 and 1 to a pair of\ndocuments, depending upon the degree of similarity between them. A value of\nzero means that the documents are completely dissimilar whereas a value of one\nindicates that the documents are practically identical. Traditionally,\nvector-based models have been used for computing the document similarity. The\nvector-based models represent several features present in documents. These\napproaches to similarity measures, in general, cannot account for the semantics\nof the document. Documents written in human languages contain contexts and the\nwords used to describe these contexts are generally semantically related.\nMotivated by this fact, many researchers have proposed seman-tic-based\nsimilarity measures by utilizing text annotation through external thesauruses\nlike WordNet (a lexical database). In this paper, we define a semantic\nsimilarity measure based on documents represented in topic maps. Topic maps are\nrapidly becoming an industrial standard for knowledge representation with a\nfocus for later search and extraction. The documents are transformed into a\ntopic map based coded knowledge and the similarity between a pair of documents\nis represented as a correlation between the common patterns (sub-trees). The\nexperimental studies on the text mining datasets reveal that this new\nsimilarity measure is more effective as compared to commonly used similarity\nmeasures in text clustering.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Mar 2013 18:28:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-19"}

For quiescent\nprominences, which exhibit many gravity-driven flows, hydrodynamic forces are\nlikely to play an important role in the determination of both the large and\nsmall scale magnetic field distributions. In this study, we present the first\nsteps toward creating three-dimensional magneto-hydrostatic prominence model\nwhere the prominence is formed in the dips of a coronal flux tube. Here 2.5D\nequilibria are created by adding mass to an initially force-free magnetic\nfield, then performing a secondary magnetohydrodynamic relaxation. Two inverse\npolarity magnetic field configurations are studied in detail, a simple o-point\nconfiguration with a ratio of the horizontal field (B_x) to the axial field\n(B_y) of 1:2 and a more complex model that also has an x-point with a ratio of\n1:11. The models show that support against gravity is either by total pressure\nor tension, with only tension support resembling observed quiescent\nprominences. The o-point of the coronal flux tube was pulled down by the\nprominence material, leading to compression of the magnetic field at the base\nof the prominence. Therefore tension support comes from the small curvature of\nthe compressed magnetic field at the bottom and the larger curvature of the\nstretched magnetic field at the top of the prominence. It was found that this\nmethod does not guarantee convergence to a prominence-like equilibrium in the\ncase where an x-point exists below the prominence flux tube. The results imply\nthat a plasma beta of ~ 0.1 is necessary to support prominences through\nmagnetic tension.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Mar 2013 01:33:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

The\nphotoluminescence polarization under circularly polarized optical pumping in\ntransverse magnetic fields (Hanle effect) is studied. A weak additional\nmagnetic field parallel to the optical axis is used to control the efficiency\nof nuclear spin cooling and the sign of nuclear spin temperature. The shape of\nthe Hanle curve is drastically modified with changing this control field, as\nobserved earlier in bulk semiconductors and quantum wells. However, the\nstandard nuclear spin cooling theory, operating with the mean nuclear magnetic\nfield (Overhauser field), fails to describe the experimental Hanle curves in a\ncertain range of control fields.

This raised the\nquestion of whether to allow an ISP to have exclusive agreement with a content\nprovider (CP). In this paper we consider discrimination in the opposite\ndirection. We study the impact that a CP can have on the benefits of several\ncompeting ISPs by sharing private information concerning the demand for its\ncontent. More precisely, we consider ISPs that compete over access to one\ncommon CP. Each ISP selects the price that it charges its subscribers for\naccessing the content.

We model the\npopulation by a measure space where the measure determines the abundance of\nindividual preferences. The preferences of an individual are described by a\nmeasurable choice of a rough path. We focus on the case of weakly interacting\nsystems, where we are able to exhibit the existence and uniqueness of\nconsistent solutions. In general, solutions are continuum of interacting\nthreads analogous to the huge number of individual atomic trajectories that\ntogether make up the motion of a fluid. The evolution of the population need\nnot be governed by any over-arching PDE. Although one can match the standard\nnonlinear parabolic PDEs of McKean-Vlasov type with specific examples of\ncommunities in this case. The bulk behaviour of the evolving population\nprovides a solution to the PDE. An important technical result is continuity of\nthe behaviour of the system with respect to changes in the measure assigning\nweight to individuals. Replacing the deterministic measure with the empirical\ndistribution of an i.i.d. sample from it leads to many standard models, and\napplying the continuity result allows easy proofs for propagation of chaos. The\nrigorous underpinning presented here leads to uncomplicated models which have\nwide applicability in both the physical and social sciences. We make no\npresumption that the macroscopic dynamics are modelled by a PDE.

In this paper, we elaborate\non the more general class of locally compact hyperbolic groups. We compute the\nequivariant $L_p$-compression in a number of locally compact examples, such as\nthe groups $SO(n,1)$: by proving that the equivariant $L_p$-compression of a\nlocally compact compactly generated group is minimal for $p=2$, we calculate\nall equivariant $L_p$-compressions of $SO(n,1)$. Next, we show that although\nthere are locally compact, non-discrete hyperbolic groups $G$ with Kazhdan's\nproperty ($T$), it is true that any locally compact hyperbolic group admits a\nproper affine isometric action on an $L_p$-space for $p$ larger than the\nAhlfors regular conformal dimension of $\\partial G$. This answers a question\nasked by Yves de Cornulier.

It is argued that the recently\nobserved broadening of the radio spectra and/or light curves in some of the\ntype Ib/c supernovae is a direct indication of inhomogeneities. As compared to\na homogeneous source, this increases the deduced velocity of the forward shock\nand the observed correlation between total energy and shock velocity could in\npart be due to a varying covering factor.

This is achieved by replacing clauses from the\nresolution refutation by the corresponding projections of the original proof.\n  We present a generalization of CERES (called CERESs) to first-order proof\nschemata and define a schematic version of the sequent calculus called LKS, and\na notion of proof schema based on primitive recursive definitions.

The survey provides\ncomplete optical identification of all sources with count rate >0.2/s over half\nthe sky ($|b|>30^\\circ$), and detected 6 intermediate polars (IPs) and 24\npolars. If we assume that the 30 mCVs included in the RBS are representative of\nthe intrinsic population, the space density of mCVs is $8^{+4}_{-2} \\times\n10^{-7}\\,{\\rmpc^{-3}}$. Considering polars and IPs separately, we find\n$\\rho_{polar}=5^{+3}_{-2} \\times 10^{-7}\\,{\\rm pc^{-3}}$ and\n$\\rho_{IP}=3^{+2}_{-1} \\times 10^{-7}\\,{\\rm pc^{-3}}$. Allowing for a 50%\nhigh-state duty cycle for polars (and assuming that these systems are below the\nRBS detection limit during their low states) doubles our estimate of\n$\\rho_{polar}$ and brings the total space density of mCVs to $1.3^{+0.6}_{-0.4}\n\\times 10^{-6}\\,{\\rm pc^{-3}}$. We also place upper limits on the sizes of\nfaint (but persistent) mCV populations that might have escaped detection in the\nRBS. Although the large uncertainties in the $\\rho$ estimates prevent us from\ndrawing strong conclusions, we discuss the implications of our results for the\nevolutionary relationship between IPs and polars, the fraction of CVs with\nstrongly magnetic white dwarfs (WDs), and for the contribution of mCVs to\nGalactic populations of hard X-ray sources at $L_X \\ga 10^{31} {\\rm erg/s}$.\nOur space density estimates are consistent with the very simple model where\nlong-period IPs evolve into polars and account for the whole short-period polar\npopulation. We find that the fraction of WDs that are strongly magnetic is not\nsignificantly higher for CV primaries than for isolated WDs. Finally, the space\ndensity of IPs is sufficiently high to explain the bright, hard X-ray source\npopulation in the Galactic Centre.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Mar 2013 14:49:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

The method exploits the\nJordan decomposition which states that a function of bounded variation can be\ndecomposed as the sum of a non-decreasing function and a non-increasing\nfunction. This suggests combining the backfitting algorithm for estimating\nadditive functions with isotonic regression for estimating monotone functions.\nThe resulting iterative algorithm is called Iterative Isotonic Regression\n(I.I.R.). The main technical result in this paper is the consistency of the\nproposed estimator when the number of iterations $k_n$ grows appropriately with\nthe sample size $n$. The proof requires two auxiliary results that are of\ninterest in and by themselves: firstly, we generalize the well-known\nconsistency property of isotonic regression to the framework of a non-monotone\nregression function, and secondly, we relate the backfitting algorithm to Von\nNeumann's algorithm in convex analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Mar 2013 15:31:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-11"}
