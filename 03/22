Since excitons in a\nsingle valley emit circularly polarized photons, linear polarization can only\nbe generated through recombination of an exciton in a coherent superposition of\nthe two valleys. In contrast, the corresponding photoluminescence from trions\nis not linearly polarized, consistent with the expectation that the emitted\nphoton polarization is entangled with valley pseudospin. The ability to address\ncoherence, in addition to valley polarization, adds a critical dimension to the\nquantum manipulation of valley index necessary for coherent valleytronics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Mar 2013 16:18:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-13"}

We review the theory of axion-photon mode\nconversion with special attention to axions emitted in the 14.4 keV M1 decay of\n57Fe at the solar center. These then mode convert to photons in the outer\nlayers of the solar envelope, and may in principle be detected subsequently as\nX-rays. For axion masses above about 10^-4 eV, resonant mode conversion at a\nlayer where the axion mass matches the local electron plasma frequency is\nnecessary. For axion masses above about 10^-2 eV, this mode conversion occurs\ntoo deep in the solar atmosphere for the resulting photon to escape the solar\nsurface and be detected before Compton scattering obscures the line. At the\n(detectable) axion masses below this, the flux of mode converted photons\npredicted by axion models appears to be too low for detection to be feasible\nwith current instrumentation. Nonresonant mode conversion for axion masses\nbelow 10^-4 eV is also plausible, but with still lower predicted fluxes, since\nthe axion coupling constant is related to it mass. Prospects for meaningful\nconstraints on massive axion parameters from X-ray observations of this\ntransition from the Sun do not appear to be promising. However parameters for\nmassless counterparts (e.g. the \"arion\") may still result from such\nobservations.

We argue that these differences\ncan be largely understood as a consequence of the effects of terms in the\nHamiltonian which break SU(2) valley symmetry, which we find to be important\nfor |\\nu|<1 but negligible for |\\nu| >1. The effective absence of valley\nanisotropy for |\\nu|>1 means that states with odd numerator, e.g. |\\nu|=5/3 or\n7/5 can accommodate charged excitations in the form of large valley skyrmions,\nwhich have a low energy cost, and may be easily induced by coupling to\nimpurities. The absence of observed quantum Hall states at these fractions is\nlikely due to the effects of valley skyrmions. For |\\nu|<1, the anisotropy\nterms favor phases in which electrons occupy states with opposite spins,\nsimilar to the antiferromagnetic state previously hypothesized to be the ground\nstate at \\nu=0. The anisotropy and Zeeman energies suppress large-area\nskyrmions, so that quantized Hall states can be observable at a set of\nfractions similar to those in GaAs two-dimensional electron systems. In a\nperpendicular magnetic field B, the competition between the Coulomb energy,\nwhich varies as B^{1/2}, and the Zeeman energy, which varies as B, can explain\nthe observation of apparent phase transitions as a function of B for fixed \\nu,\nas transitions between states with different degrees of spin polarization.

New observations of\nM87 enable us to put forward a comprehensive model for the physical heating\nmechanism. Low-frequency radio observations by LOFAR revealed the absence of\nfossil cosmic-ray (CR) electrons in the radio halo surrounding M87. This puzzle\ncan be resolved by accounting for the CR release from the radio cocoons and the\nsubsequent mixing of CRs with the dense ambient intracluster gas, which\nthermalizes the electrons on a timescale similar to the radio halo age of 40\nMyr. Hadronic interactions of similarly injected CR protons with the ambient\ngas should produce an observable gamma-ray signal in accordance with the steady\nemission of the low state of M87 detected by Fermi and H.E.S.S. Hence, we\nnormalize the CR population to the gamma-ray emission, which shows the same\nspectral slope as the CR injection spectrum probed by LOFAR, thereby supporting\na common origin. We show that CRs, which stream at the Alfven velocity with\nrespect to the plasma rest frame, heat the surrounding thermal plasma at a rate\nthat balances that of radiative cooling on average at each radius. However, the\nresulting global thermal equilibrium is locally unstable and allows for the\nformation of the observed cooling multi-phase medium through thermal\ninstability. Provided that CR heating balances cooling during the emerging\n\"cooling flow,\" the collapse of the majority of the gas is halted around 1 keV\n- in accordance with X-ray data. We show that both the existence of a\ntemperature floor and the similar radial scaling of the heating and cooling\nrates are generic predictions of the CR heating model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Mar 2013 20:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Oct 2013 20:15:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

With\nthis sample we can estimate the relative size f=|Y|/|X| of any subset Y as\n|S_k(X) intersect Y|/k. A standard application is the estimation of the Jaccard\nsimilarity f=|A intersect B|/|A union B| between sets A and B. Given the\nbottom-k samples from A and B, we construct the bottom-k sample of their union\nas S_k(A union B)=S_k(S_k(A) union S_k(B)), and then the similarity is\nestimated as |S_k(A union B) intersect S_k(A) intersect S_k(B)|/k.\n  We show here that even if the hash function is only 2-independent, the\nexpected relative error is O(1/sqrt(fk)). For fk=Omega(1) this is within a\nconstant factor of the expected relative error with truly random hashing.\n  For comparison, consider the classic approach of kxmin-wise where we use k\nhash independent functions h_1,...,h_k, storing the smallest element with each\nhash function. For kxmin-wise there is an at least constant bias with constant\nindependence, and it is not reduced with larger k. Recently Feigenblat et al.\nshowed that bottom-k circumvents the bias if the hash function is 8-independent\nand k is sufficiently large. We get down to 2-independence for any k. Our\nresult is based on a simply union bound, transferring generic concentration\nbounds for the hashing scheme to the bottom-k sample, e.g., getting stronger\nprobability error bounds with higher independence.\n  For weighted sets, we consider priority sampling which adapts efficiently to\nthe concrete input weights, e.g., benefiting strongly from heavy-tailed input.\nThis time, the analysis is much more involved, but again we show that generic\nconcentration bounds can be applied.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Mar 2013 22:18:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Jun 2013 19:17:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-12"}

The data cover a wide wavelength range from 2,000 Angstroms in\nthe UV to 2.4 microns in the NIR. Optical spectra provide line profiles and\nvelocity measurements of HI, HeI, CaII and FeII that trace the composition and\nkinematics of the SN. NIR spectra show that helium is present in the atmosphere\nas early as 11 days after the explosion. A UV spectrum obtained with the STIS\nreveals that the UV flux for SN 2011dh is low compared to other SN IIb. The HI\nand HeI velocities in SN 2011dh are separated by about 4,000 km/s at all\nphases. We estimate that the H-shell of SN 2011dh is about 8 times less massive\nthan the shell of SN 1993J and about 3 times more massive than the shell of SN\n2008ax. Light curves (LC) for twelve passbands are presented. The maximum\nbolometric luminosity of $1.8 \\pm 0.2 \\times 10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$ occurred\nabout 22 days after the explosion. NIR emission provides more than 30% of the\ntotal bolometric flux at the beginning of our observations and increases to\nnearly 50% of the total by day 34. The UV produces 16% of the total flux on day\n4, 5% on day 9 and 1% on day 34. We compare the bolometric light curves of SN\n2011dh, SN 2008ax and SN 1993J. The LC are very different for the first twelve\ndays after the explosions but all three SN IIb display similar peak\nluminosities, times of peak, decline rates and colors after maximum. This\nsuggests that the progenitors of these SN IIb may have had similar compositions\nand masses but they exploded inside hydrogen shells that that have a wide range\nof masses. The detailed observations presented here will help evaluate\ntheoretical models for this supernova and lead to a better understanding of SN\nIIb.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Mar 2013 22:49:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 Dec 2013 16:17:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

A prominent population of MS stars is\ndetected in all three fields and can be traced as faint as g~24 mag. Using\ntheoretical isochrone fitting we derive an age of 9.1(+1.0;-1.1)Gyr, a median\nabundance of [Fe/H]=-0.70 (+0.15; -0.20)dex and d_helio of 30.9+-3.0kpc for the\nMS of the Sgr Stream Branch A.

The SD\nframework is then applied to analyse compressed imaging with a multi-resolution\nstatistical image model using both the generalized Gaussian distribution and\nthe two-state Gaussian mixture distribution.

The\nsymmetry group of space-time provides not one but an infinity of such\nrepresentations which are equivalent for free particles but yield different\nelectromagnetic couplings upon gauging; thus the challenge is to develop\ncriteria which allow us to select those of them which relate to physically\ndetectable particles. We here take the position that the unitarity of the\nCompton scattering cross sections in the ultrarelativistic limit, when\npredicted by a consistent method for a spin-$1$ description, could provide such\na criterion. We analyze the properties of massive fundamental spin-$1$ bosons\ntransforming as antisymmetric tensors of second rank, $(1,0)\\oplus(0,1)$. For\nthis purpose, we employ the Poincar\\'e covariant projector method, which\nprovides consistent, causal, and representation specific Lagrangians. This\nformalism yields a twofold extension of the Proca Lagrangian for the\ndescription of spin-$1$ bosons, first from an in-built $g=1$ value of the\ngyromagnetic ratio to an unspecified $g\\not=1$, and from, single-parity, to\nparity-doublet degrees of freedom. We find different results for Compton\nscattering in these theories and track the differences to the lack of\nuniversality of the vector-antisymmetric-tensor equivalence theorem which is\nspecific only to Proca's framework, and valid for $g=1$, while it is violated\nwithin the covariant projector formalism. Our main result is that a finite\nCompton scattering differential cross section in the ultrarelativistic limit\nrequires us to consider the contributions of both parities in\n$(1,0)\\oplus(0,1)$. On that basis, we conclude that massive spin-$1$ bosons\ntransforming as antisymmetric tensors are physical parity doublets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Mar 2013 03:54:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 May 2013 20:54:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-20"}

In addition to the dust\nproduction by type II supernovae (SNeII) and asymptotic giant branch (AGB)\nstars, we consider three processes in the ISM: (i) dust destruction by SN\nshocks, (ii) metal accretion onto the surface of preexisting grains in the cold\nneutral medium (CNM) (called grain growth), and (iii) grain-grain collisions\n(shattering and coagulation) in the warm neutral medium (WNM) and CNM. We found\nthat the grain size distribution in galaxies is controlled by stellar sources\nin the early stage of galaxy evolution, and that afterwards the main processes\nthat govern the size distribution changes to those in the ISM. Since shattering\nproduces a large abundance of small grains (consequently, the surface-to-volume\nratio of grains increases), it enhances the efficiency of grain growth,\ncontributing to the significant increase of the total dust mass. Grain growth\ncreates a large bump in the grain size distribution around a ~ 0.01 \\mu m.\nCoagulation occurs effectively after the number of small grains is enhanced by\nshattering, and the grain size distribution is deformed to have a bump at a ~\n0.03 - 0.05 \\mu m at t ~ 10 Gyr. We conclude that the evolutions of the total\ndust mass and the grain size distribution in galaxies are closely related to\neach other, and the grain size distribution changes considerably through the\ngalaxy evolution because the dominant dust processes which regulate the grain\nsize distribution change.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Mar 2013 06:44:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

The timing analysis\nallowed us to obtain the first measurement of the period derivative of SGR\n0418+5729: \\dot{P}=4(1)x10^{-15} s/s, significant at ~3.5 sigma confidence\nlevel. This leads to a surface dipolar magnetic field of B_dip ~6x 10^{12} G.\nThis measurement confirms SGR 0418+5729 as the lowest magnetic field magnetar.\nFollowing the flux and spectral evolution from the beginning of the outburst up\nto ~1200 days, we observe a gradual cooling of the tiny hot spot responsible\nfor the X-ray emission, from a temperature of ~0.9 to 0.3 keV.

The method is used to study finite field\npara-ferrimagnetic phase transitions observed in layered uranium compounds,\nUAs_{1-x}Se_x, UPd_2Si_2 or UNi_2Si_2. The above-mentioned systems are made of\nferromagnetic layers and the spins from the nearest-neighbor and\nnext-nearest-neighbor layers are coupled by the antiferromagnetic interactions\nJ_1<0 and J_2<0, respectively.

Radial gas inflow has\nlittle influence on gas-phase and stellar metallicity gradients, which are\naffected much more strongly by the fraction of metals that are directly\ninjected into the halo gas, rather than mixed with the cold gas. Metals ejected\nout of the galaxy in early epochs result in late infall of pre-enriched gas and\nflatter present-day gas-phase metallicity gradients. A prescription in which\n80% of the metals are injected into the halo gas results in good fits to the\nflat observed metallicity gradients in galaxies with stellar masses greater\nthan 10^10 M_sun, as well as the relations between gas-phase metallicity and\nsSFR in the outer parts of galactic disks. We examine the correlation between\ngas-phase metallicity gradient and global galaxy properties, finding that it is\nmost strongly correlated with the bulge-to-total ratio of the galaxy. This is\nbecause gas is consumed when the bulge forms during galaxy mergers, and the\ngas-phase metallicity gradient is then set by newly-accreted gas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Mar 2013 11:24:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Jun 2013 08:02:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-29"}

However, the results presented here suggest that more\nobservations are needed in order to make a strong conclusion about the stellar\nevolution models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Mar 2013 13:22:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

Although diseases may go extinct due\nto random loss of effective contacts where the infection is transmitted to new\nsusceptible individuals, the time to extinction in the absence of control may\nbe prohibitively long. Thus intervention controls, such as vaccination of\nsusceptible individuals and/or treatment of infectives, are typically based on\na deterministic schedule, such as periodically vaccinating susceptible children\nbased on school calendars. In reality, however, such policies are administered\nas a random process, while still possessing a mean period. Here, we consider\nthe effect of randomly distributed intervention as disease control on large\nfinite populations. We show explicitly how intervention control, based on mean\nperiod and treatment fraction, modulates the average extinction times as a\nfunction of population size and rate of infection spread. In particular, our\nresults show an exponential improvement in extinction times even though the\ncontrols are implemented using a random Poisson distribution. Finally, we\ndiscover those parameter regimes where random treatment yields an exponential\nimprovement in extinction times over the application of strictly periodic\nintervention.

These observations are complicated by the fact that the mapping of\nredshifts to line-of-sight positions is distorted by the peculiar velocities of\nthe gas. Such distortions can be a source of error if they are not properly\nunderstood, but they also encode information about cosmology and astrophysics.\nWe study the effects of redshift space distortions on the power spectrum of\n21-cm radiation from the EoR using large scale $N$-body and radiative transfer\nsimulations. We quantify the anisotropy introduced in the 21-cm power spectrum\nby redshift space distortions and show how it evolves as reionization\nprogresses and how it relates to the underlying physics. We go on to study the\neffects of redshift space distortions on LOFAR observations, taking instrument\nnoise and foreground subtraction into account. We find that LOFAR should be\nable to directly observe the power spectrum anisotropy due to redshift space\ndistortions at spatial scales around $k \\sim 0.1$ Mpc$^{-1}$ after $\\gtrsim$\n1000 hours of integration time. At larger scales, sample errors become a\nlimiting factor, while at smaller scales detector noise and foregrounds make\nthe extraction of the signal problematic. Finally, we show how the\nastrophysical information contained in the evolution of the anisotropy of the\n21-cm power spectrum can be extracted from LOFAR observations, and how it can\nbe used to distinguish between different reionization scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Mar 2013 14:39:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 Jul 2013 14:09:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

We\nstudy quantum heat transfer in a self-consistent thermal bath setup consisting\nof two lead regions connected by a center region. Atoms both in the leads and\nin the center region are coupled to quantum Langevin heat baths that mimic the\ndamping and dephasing of phonon waves by anharmonic scattering. This approach\ntreats the leads and the center region on same footing and thereby allows for a\nsimple and physically transparent thermalization of the system, enabling also\nperfect acoustic matching between the leads and the center region. Increasing\nthe strength of the coupling reduces the mean free path of phonons and\ngradually shifts phonon transport from ballistic regime to diffusive regime. In\nthe center region, the bath temperatures are determined self-consistently from\nthe requirement of zero net energy exchange between the local heat bath and\neach atom.

This is generally\ninterpreted as the price to be paid for the numerous services provided by this\naxiom. The theory proposed by Olivier Leroy shows that we can have\nsimultaneously axiom of choice and \" everything is measurable \" it takes place\nwithin the framework of \"locales\" which are particular cases of Grothendieck's\ntoposes : a \"locale\" is just a poset which has the formal properties of the\nposet of open subsets of a topological space. \"Locales\" have already been the\nobject of numerous studies (cf for example \"Sheaves in Geometry and Logic\" of\nS.Mac Lane and I.Moerdijk. Springer 92.). One of the remarkable aspects of this\ntheory is that it applies in a relevant way to the usual topological spaces in\nwhich it shows up \" non standard sub-spaces \" (sub-locales)); with for\nconsequence that the intersection (in the meaning of locale) of ordinary\nsub-spaces is not anymore necessarily a (ordinary) sub-space. We have for\nexample a sub-locale of R (called generic sub-locale of R) which is the\nintersection of dense open sets and which is still dense (although pointless).\nThe most striking result is doubtless that the natural continuation of the\nmeasure of Lebesgue (on [0,1] for example) on the open sets to the totality of\nsub-locales of [0,1] is a sigma additive outside regular measure The\n\"paradoxical \" partitions which gave non-measurable subsets in the classical\ncontext are no more partitions in the context of locales.

We consider exact free and isotropic HO\npotential cases and perturbations about these. Moreover, our purely relational\nkinematical quantization is distinct from the usual one for $\\mathbb{CP}^2$,\nwhich turns out to carry absolutist connotations instead. Thus this paper is\nthe first to note absolute-versus-relational motion distinctions at the\nkinematical rather than dynamical level, and also an example of value to the\ndiscussion of kinematical quantization along the lines of Isham 1984. This\ntreatment of the relational quadrilateral is the first relational QM with very\nnew mathematics for a finite QM model, and is far more typical of the general\nquantum relational $N$-a-gon than the previously-studied case of the relational\ntriangle. We consider useful integrals as regards perturbation theory and the\npeaking interpretation of quantum cosmology. We subsequently consider problem\nof time applications of this: quantum Kucha\\v{r} beables, the Machian version\nof the semiclassical approach and the timeless naive Schrodinger\ninterpretation.

As\nbefore, there is no clear answer to this question even for the one-dimensional\ncompleted scattering (OCS). In this paper we show that this seemingly simple\nquestion stands alongside with such fundamental problems of quantum mechanics\n(QM) as the Schrodinger's-cat and and EPR-Bohm paradoxes. Their common feature\nis that the states of a scattered particle, a radioactive atom and electron\nEPR-pair represent pure {\\it micro-cat} states. It is widely accepted that the\nEPR-Bohm paradox implies the non-existence of local hidden variables (LHVs),\nthe cat paradox represents a macro-objectification problem and the tunneling\ntime is an observer-dependent quantity whose definitions must be 'operational'.\nAt the same time, according to the probabilistic approach (Accardi, Khrennikov,\nPhilipp, Hess {\\it et al.}) to Bell's inequality that underlies the EPR-Bohm\nexperiments, its experimental violation means simply that it contains\nprobability distributions associated with mutually incompatible statistical\ndata. We argue that this approach must be extended onto micro-cat states\nbecause they describe, too, mutually incompatible statistical data. The current\npractice to interpret the squared modulus of a micro-cat state as the\nprobability density should be recognized as erroneous. It is this practice that\nmakes QM incompatible with classical physical theories and, thereby, makes the\nmicro-world 'unspeakable'. The known 'operational' tunneling-time concepts,\nelaborated in line with this practice, are logically inconsistent. We argue\nthat the TTP and the cat paradox must be solved at the level of single\nelectrons and atoms, without resorting to environment and measurement contexts.\nWe present a new model of the OCS and solve the TTP on its basis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Mar 2013 07:36:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 May 2013 14:03:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 25 May 2013 11:51:56 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 24 Mar 2014 12:26:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-25"}

Rather, graphene is strongly diamagnetic, similar to graphite.\nThus the possible traces of a quasi-magnetic behavior which some authors\nobserved in their samples may be attributed rather to induced magnetism due to\nthe impurities, defects, etc. On the basis of the present analysis the\nconclusion was made that the thorough and detailed experimental studies of\nthese problems only may shed light on the very complicated problem of the\nmagnetism of carbon-based materials.
