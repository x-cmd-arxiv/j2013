In R-parity conserving models, the\nlightest neutralino is then a higgsino-like WIMP (albeit with non-negligible\ngaugino components), with thermal relic density well below measured values.\nThis leaves room for axions to function as co-dark matter particles. The local\nWIMP abundance is then expected to be below standard estimates, and direct and\nindirect detection rates must be accordingly rescaled. We calculate rescaled\ndirect and indirect higgsino-like WIMP detection rates in SUSY models that\nfulfil the electroweak naturalness condition. In spite of the rescaling, we\nfind that ton-scale noble liquid detectors can probe the entire higgsino-like\nWIMP parameter space, so that these experiments should either discover WIMPs or\nexclude the concept of electroweak naturalness in R-parity conserving natural\nSUSY models. Prospects for spin-dependent or indirect detection are more\nlimited due in part to the rescaling effect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Mar 2013 16:01:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

It is shown that the\nchromium ions in our samples are in low to intermediate ligand field and that\nDq and Dq/B decrease when the aluminium content increases. The absorption cross\nsections of Cr3+ are similar to that reported in glasses and crystals, whereas\nCr4+ has lower values than reference laser materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Mar 2013 17:20:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

Motivated by these dynamical systems, this paper generalizes in two\ndirections previous studies of orbital evolution in planetary systems with\nstellar mass loss: [1] Many previous treatments focus on constant mass loss\nrates and much of this work is carried out numerically. Here we study a class\nof single planet systems where the stellar mass loss rate is time dependent.\nThe mass loss rate can be increasing or decreasing, but the stellar mass always\ndecreases monotonically. For this class of models, we develop analytic\napproximations to specify the final orbital elements for planets that remain\nbound after the epoch of mass loss, and find the conditions required for the\nplanets to become unbound. We also show that for some mass loss functions,\nplanets become unbound only in the asymptotic limit where the stellar mass\nvanishes. [2] We consider the chaotic evolution for two planet systems with\nstellar mass loss. Here we focus on a model consisting of analogs of Jupiter,\nSaturn, and the Sun. By monitoring the divergence of initially similar\ntrajectories through time, we calculate the Lyapunov exponents of the system.\nThis analog solar system is chaotic in the absence of mass loss with Lyapunov\ntime in the range 5 - 10 Myr; we find that the Lyapunov time decreases with\nincreasing stellar mass loss rate, with a nearly linear relationship between\nthe two time scales. Taken together, the results of this paper help provide an\nexplanation for a wide range of dynamical evolution that occurs in solar\nsystems with stellar mass loss.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Mar 2013 18:10:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

In\nanticipation of a future balloon experiment, an accelerator test was conducted\nin 2004 and 2005 at KEK, Japan, in order to prove the concept and to precisely\nmeasure the X-ray yields of antiprotonic exotic atoms formed with different\ntarget materials [1].

Growth passes from the well-known run-away stage (when $u$ is higher\nthan the big bodies' hill velocity) to the newly discovered trans-hill stage\n(when $u$ and big bodies both grow, but $u$ remains at the big bodies' hill\nvelocity).

The\nquestions of how runaway ends and what comes next have not been answered\nsatisfactorily. Here we show that runaway is followed by a `trans-hill stage'\nthat commences once the bodies become trans-hill, i.e. once the Hill velocity\nof the bodies that dominate viscous stirring matches the random speed of the\nsmall bodies they accrete. Subsequently, the small bodies' speed grows in\nlockstep with the big bodies' sizes, such that the bodies remain in the\ntrans-hill state. Trans-hill growth is crucial for determining the efficiency\nof growing big bodies, as well as their growth timescale and size spectrum.\n  We work out the properties of trans-hill growth analytically and confirm\nthese numerically. Trans-hill growth has two sub-stages. In the earlier one,\ncollisional cooling is irrelevant, in which case the efficiency of forming big\nbodies remains very low (0.1% in the Kuiper belt) and their mass spectrum is\nflat. This explains results from previous coagulation simulations for both the\nKuiper belt and the asteroid belt. The second sub-stage commences when small\nbodies begin to collide with one another. Collisional cooling then controls the\nevolution, in which case the efficiency of forming big bodies rises, and their\nsize spectrum becomes more top-heavy.\n  Trans-hill growth terminates in one of two ways, depending on parameters.\nFirst, mutual accretion of big bodies can become significant and conglomeration\nproceeds until half the total mass is converted into big bodies. This mode of\ngrowth may explain the size distributions of minor bodies in the Solar System,\nand is explored in forthcoming work. Second, if big bodies become separated by\ntheir Hill radius, oligarchy commences. This mode likely precedes the formation\nof fully-fledged planets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Mar 2013 20:00:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

Complementary to this study,\nour analysis shows that the algorithm is able to clearly distinguish scale-free\nnetworks from other widespread and important classes of complex networks, such\nas Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi networks and hierarchical graphs. We show that the ranking\ncapabilities of the quantum PageRank algorithm are related to an increased\nstability with respect to a variation of the damping parameter $\\alpha$ that\nappears in the Google algorithm, and to a more clearly pronounced power-law\nbehavior in the distribution of importance among the nodes, as compared to the\nclassical algorithm. Finally, we study to which extent the increased\nsensitivity of the quantum algorithm persists under coordinated attacks of the\nmost important nodes in scale-free and Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi random graphs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Mar 2013 20:00:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 May 2013 15:27:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-30"}

The mass-loss rates are based on hydrodynamic models of\nevaporation that include both X-ray and EUV irradiation. We find that only\nlow-mass planets with hydrogen envelopes are significantly affected by\nevaporation, with evaporation being able to remove massive hydrogen envelopes\ninward of 0.1 AU for Neptune-mass objects.\n  We construct a theoretical population of planets with varying core masses,\nenvelope masses, orbital separations, and stellar spectral types, and compare\nthese against the sizes and densities measured for low-mass planets, both in\nthe Kepler mission and from radial velocity surveys. This exercise leads us to\nconclude that evaporation is the driving force of evolution for close-in Kepler\nplanets. In fact, some 50% of the Kepler planet candidates may have been\nsignificantly eroded. Evaporation explains two striking correlations observed\nin these objects: a lack of large radius/low density planets close to the\nstars, and a bimodal distribution in planet sizes with a deficit of planets\naround 2R_E. Planets that have experienced high X-ray exposures are generally\nsmaller than this size, and those with lower X-ray exposures are typically\nlarger. A bimodal distribution is naturally explained by the evaporation model,\nwhere, depending on their X-ray exposure, close-in planets can either hold on\nto hydrogen envelopes 1% in mass, or be stripped entirely.\n  To quantitatively reproduce the observed features, we argue that not only do\nlow-mass Kepler planets need to be made of rocky cores overlaid with hydrogen\nenvelopes, but few of them should have initial masses above 20 M_E, and the\nmajority of them should have core masses of a few Earth masses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Mar 2013 20:24:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 Aug 2013 15:43:02 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 6 Aug 2013 14:54:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

Noncoherent detection is all that is needed in\nthe application to RFID technology where it is only the identity of the active\nusers that is required.

On the other hand, the secondary body was\nmuch less active at these epochs, in agreement with the absence of significant\nnebular emission. The high current SFR can explain the very blue colors and the\nhigh ionized gas content in IZw18, resembling primeval galaxies in the early\nUniverse.

Mazes have\nbeen proposed to be solved using memristive networks and in this paper we\nextend the idea to show how networks of memristive elements can be utilised to\nsolve multiple shortest paths in a single network. We also show simulations\nusing memristive circuit elements that demonstrate shortest path computations\nin both 2D and 3D networks, which could have potential applications in various\nfields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Mar 2013 23:09:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-19"}

At the same time, sparsely\ndistributed core cells spread their influences to form colonies, and\ninteractions between colonies eventually determine each cell's identity.

As a consequence of the study of the large\npopulation limit, global existence of a nonnegative weak solution to a\nmultidimensional parabolic strongly coupled model of competing species is\nproved. The main new feature of the corresponding integro-differential equation\nis the nonlocal nonlinearity appearing in the diffusion terms, which may depend\non the spatial densities of all population types. Moreover, the diffusion\nmatrix is generally not strictly positive definite and the cross-diffusion\neffect allows for linearly growing influences of the subpopulations' sizes.

Two competing mechanisms are identified, both relying\non the interaction between the magnetic field and the low quark modes. While\nthe coupling to valence quarks enhances the condensate, the interaction with\nsea quarks suppresses it in the transition region. The latter `sea effect' acts\nby ordering the Polyakov loop and, thereby, reduces the number of small Dirac\neigenmodes and the condensate. It is most effective around the transition\ntemperature, where the Polyakov loop effective potential is flat and a small\ncorrection to it by the magnetic field can have a significant effect. Around\nthe critical temperature, the sea suppression overwhelms the valence\nenhancement, resulting in a net suppression of the condensate, named inverse\nmagnetic catalysis. We support this physical picture by lattice simulations\nincluding continuum extrapolated results on the Polyakov loop as a function of\ntemperature and magnetic field.
