This has led to discussions\nabout the existence of terrestrial planets with a carbon-dominated composition\nthat is very different from the composition of the Earth. The C/O values were\nobtained by determining carbon abundances from high-excitation CI lines and\noxygen abundances from the forbidden [OI] line at 6300 A. This weak line is,\nhowever, strongly affected by a nickel blend at high metallicities. Aiming for\nmore precise C/O ratios, oxygen abundances in this paper are derived from the\nhigh-excitation OI triplet at 7774 A and carbon abundances from the CI lines at\n5052 and 5380 A using MARCS model atmospheres and including non-LTE\ncorrections. The results do not confirm the high C/O ratios previously found.\nC/O shows a tight, slightly increasing dependence on metallicity from C/O=0.58\nat [Fe/H]=0.0 to C/O=0.70 at [Fe/H] =0.4 with an rms scatter of only 0.06.\nAssuming that the composition of a proto-planetary disk is the same as that of\nthe host star, the C/O values found in this paper lend no support to the\nexistence of carbon-rich planets. The small scatter of C/O among thin-disk\nstars suggests that the nucleosynthesis products of Type II supernovae and low-\nto intermediate-mass stars are well mixed in the interstellar medium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Mar 2013 16:01:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

So thus, the automatic gates are one of the\nexamples that human nature invent to bring comfort and ease in its daily life.\nTo this end, we model and design an automatic sliding door with a room light\ncontrol system to provide the mentioned needs. This was achieved by considering\nsome factors such as economy, availability of components and research\nmaterials, efficiency, compatibility and portability and also durability in the\ndesign process. The performance of the system after test met design\nspecifications. This system works on the principle of breaking an infrared beam\nof light, sensed by a photodiode. It consists of two transmitting infrared\ndiodes and two receiving photo-diodes. The first one is for someone coming in\nand the second one is for someone going out of the room. The photodiodes are\nconnected to comparators, which give a lower output when the beam is broken and\nhigh output when transmitting normally. The general operation of the work and\nperformance is dependent on the presence of an intruder entering through the\ndoor and how close he/she is in closer to the door. The door is meant to open\nautomatically but in a case where there is no power supply trying to force the\ndoor open would damage the mechanical control system of the unit. The overall\nwork was implemented with a constructed work, tested working and perfectly\nfunctional.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Mar 2013 16:02:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-08"}

The goal of the present study is to incorporate this\nmicrostructural model into the macroscopic viscoplasticity framework proposed\nby Shutov and Krei\\ss ig (2008a). Thereby, the two-phase composite approach is\nexamined carefully. Both physical and numerical drawbacks are revealed and\npossible solutions are presented, thus leading to a refined micro model.\nMoreover, some improvements concerning reliable parameter identification are\nsuggested as well. The material parameters of the refined micro model are\nidentified for an aluminum alloy using TEM cell size measurements. Then, an\nextension to non-proportional deformation is performed in such a way that the\nevolution of dislocation densities becomes sensitive to load path changes.\nExperimental findings suggest that such deformation modes can significantly\ninfluence the evolution of microstructure, including the dissolution of cells\nand the reduction of total dislocation density shortly after the load path\nchange. In order to capture such effects, some tensor-valued state variables\nare introduced which couple the refined micro model with the macroscopic\nviscoplasticity model. As a result, a new system of constitutive equations is\nobtained. In order to demonstrate its capability to respond to load path\nchanges, load cases as typical for Equal Channel Angular Pressing (ECAP) are\nconsidered. The obtained evolution of dislocation populations differs\nsignficantly depending on which ECAP route is applied.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Mar 2013 16:10:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-08"}

In this system, ultrasonic sound is transmitted from the transmitting\ndevice which is normally in the form of energy. The transmitted sound utilizes\nair as its medium and this travel in a wave type motion. The wave is reflected\nback from the surroundings in the room/hallway and the device hears a pitch\ncharacteristic of the protected environment.

Specifically, we have carried out two-dimensional surface\nbrightness decompositions of the host galaxies of 9 new AGNs imaged with the\nHubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3. The surface brightness\ndecompositions allow us to create \"AGN-free\" images of the galaxies, from which\nwe measure the starlight contribution to the optical luminosity measured\nthrough the ground-based spectroscopic aperture. We also incorporate 20 new\nreverberation-mapping measurements of the Hbeta time lag, which is assumed to\nyield the average Hbeta BLR radius. The final sample includes 41 AGNs covering\nfour orders of magnitude in luminosity. The additions and updates incorporated\nhere primarily affect the low-luminosity end of the R-L relationship. The best\nfit to the relationship using a Bayesian analysis finds a slope of alpha =\n0.533 (+0.035/-0.033), consistent with previous work and with simple\nphotoionization arguments.

A large fraction of the\nremaining scatter in the relationship is likely due to the inaccurate distances\nto the AGN host galaxies. Our results help support the possibility that the R-L\nrelationship could potentially be used to turn the BLRs of AGNs into\nstandardizable candles. This would allow the cosmological expansion of the\nUniverse to be probed by a separate population of objects, and over a larger\nrange of redshifts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Mar 2013 16:47:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

In such systems, the normal state is expected to\nbe quite different from a Landau-Fermi liquid - the basis for the conventional\nBCS theory of superconductivity. The situation is additionally complicated by\nthe fact that cuprates are susceptible to charge/spin ordering tendencies,\nespecially in the low-doping regime.

We propose a novel systems approach to complex trait\nprediction, which leverages and integrates similarity in genetic,\ntranscriptomic or other omics-level data.

Using seven disease datasets from\nthe Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC), we show that OmicKriging\nallows simple integration of sparse and highly polygenic components yielding\ncomparable performance at a fraction of the computing time of a recently\npublished Bayesian sparse linear mixed model method.

The rate gain region is derived as a piece-wise linear approximation in\nlog-domain, and numerical results show that the approximation closely matches\nthe exact region.

A few\nmethods have been devised in the past and used in several cases to trace back\nthe origin of small impactors. On February 15, 2013, a medium-sized meteoroid\nhit the atmosphere in the Chelyabinsk region of Russia, causing damage in\nseveral large cities. The incident, the largest registered since the Tunguska\nevent, was witnessed by many thousands and recorded by hundreds of amateur and\npublic video recording systems. The amount and quality of the information\ngathered by those systems is sufficient to attempt a reconstruction of the\ntrajectory of the impactor body in the atmosphere, and from this the orbit of\nthe body with respect to the Sun. Using amateur and public footage taken in\nfour different places close to the event, we have determined precisely the\nproperties of the entrance trajectory and the orbit of the Chelyabinsk event\nimpactor. We found that the object entered the atmosphere at a velocity ranging\nfrom 16.0 to 17.4 km/s in a grazing trajectory, almost directly from the east,\nwith an azimuth of velocity vector of 285$^o$, and with an elevation of\n15.8$^o$ with respect to the local horizon.

(2013) of a vast thin disk of satellites\n(VTDS) around M31 offers a new challenge for the understanding of the Local\nGroup properties. This comes in addition to the unexpected proximity of the\nMagellanic Clouds (MCs) to the Milky Way (MW), and to another vast polar\nstructure (VPOS), which is almost perpendicular to our Galaxy disk. We find\nthat the VTDS plane is coinciding with several stellar, tidally-induced streams\nin the outskirts of M31, and, that its velocity distribution is consistent with\nthat of the Giant Stream (GS). This is suggestive of a common physical\nmechanism, likely linked to merger tidal interactions, knowing that a similar\nargument may apply to the VPOS at the MW location. Furthermore, the VTDS is\npointing towards the MW, being almost perpendicular to the MW disk, as the VPOS\nis.\n  We compare these properties to the modelling of M31 as an ancient, gas-rich\nmajor merger, which has been successfully used to predict the M31 substructures\nand the GS origin. We find that without fine tuning, the induced tidal tails\nare lying in the VTDS plane, providing a single and common origin for many\nstellar streams and for the vast stellar structures surrounding both the MW and\nM31. The model also reproduces quite accurately positions and velocities of the\nVTDS dSphs. Our conjecture leads to a novel interpretation of the Local Group\npast history, as a gigantic tidal tail due to the M31 ancient merger is\nexpected to send material towards the MW, including the MCs.

Since\nvertical gravity is neglected in this work, our focus is on how the MRI\nsaturates in the optically thick mid-plane of the disk. We confirm that\nturbulence generated by the MRI is very compressible in the radiation dominated\nregime, as found by previous calculations using the flux-limited diffusion\napproximation. We also find little difference in the saturation properties in\ncalculations that use a larger horizontal domain (up to four times the vertical\nscale height in the radial direction). However, in strongly radiation pressure\ndominated disks (one in which the radiation energy density reaches 1% of the\nrest mass energy density of the gas), we find Maxwell stress from the MRI\nturbulence is larger than the value produced when radiation pressure is\nreplaced with the same amount of gas pressure. At the same time, the ratio\nbetween Maxwell stress and Reynolds stress is increased by almost a factor of 8\ncompared with the gas pressure dominated case. We suggest that this effect is\ncaused by radiation drag, which acts like bulk viscosity and changes the\neffective magnetic Prandtl number of the fluid. Radiation viscosity\nsignificantly exceeds both the microscopic plasma viscosity and resistivity,\nensuring that radiation dominated systems occupy the high magnetic Prandtl\nnumber regime. Nevertheless, we find radiative shear viscosity is negligible\ncompared to the Maxwell and Reynolds stress in the flow. This may have\nimportant implications for the structure of radiation dominated accretion\ndisks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Mar 2013 21:01:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-09"}

The sample\npresented here either have previous IFU and high resolution imaging data that\nshow double-nuclei in the IR as well as kinematicly and spatially distinct line\nemitting regions. Two sources have detections of double point sources in either\nthe X-ray or radio. The sources studied are therefore likely binary AGN.

A first obstacle along this path is to\ndecipher the mechanisms by which protein aggregates are targeted to specific\nintercellular locations.

Using single-particle tracking of\nprotein aggregates in live E. coli cells, we estimated the average size and\ndiffusion constant of the aggregates. Our results evidence that the aggregates\npassively diffuse within the cell, with diffusion constants that depend on\ntheir size in agreement with the Stokes-Einstein law. However, the aggregate\ndisplacements along the cell long axis are confined to a region that roughly\ncorresponds to the nucleoid-free space in the cell pole, thus confirming the\nimportance of increased macromolecular crowding in the nucleoids. We thus used\n3d individual-based modeling to show that these three ingredients (diffusion,\naggregation and diffusion hindrance in the nucleoids) are sufficient and\nnecessary to reproduce the available experimental data on aggregate\nlocalization in the cells. Taken together, our results strongly support the\nhypothesis that the localization of aging-related protein aggregates in the\npoles of E. coli results from the coupling of passive diffusion- aggregation\nwith spatially non-homogeneous macromolecular crowding.

Our goal is to\ndesign an artificial noise (AN)-aided transmit strategy, such that the\nachievable secrecy rate is maximized subject to the sum power constraint.\nAN-aided secure transmission has recently been found to be a promising approach\nfor blocking eavesdropping attempts. In many existing studies, the confidential\ninformation transmit covariance and the AN covariance are not simultaneously\noptimized. In particular, for design convenience, it is common to prefix the AN\ncovariance as a specific kind of spatially isotropic covariance. This paper\nconsiders joint optimization of the transmit and AN covariances for secrecy\nrate maximization (SRM), with a design flexibility that the AN can take any\nspatial pattern. Hence, the proposed design has potential in jamming the\neavesdroppers more effectively, based upon the channel state information (CSI).\nWe derive an optimization approach to the SRM problem through both analysis and\nconvex conic optimization machinery.

Our\nframework deals with a general setup of multiple multi-antenna eavesdroppers,\nand can cater for additional constraints arising from specific application\nscenarios, such as interference temperature constraints in interference\nnetworks. We also generalize the framework to an imperfect CSI case where a\nworst-case robust SRM formulation is considered. A suboptimal but safe solution\nto the outage-constrained robust SRM design is also investigated. Simulation\nresults show that the proposed AN-aided SRM design yields significant secrecy\nrate gains over an optimal no-AN design and the isotropic AN design, especially\nwhen there are more eavesdroppers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Mar 2013 09:04:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

In this paper, an implementation of\nApproximate kNN-based spatial clustering algorithm using the K-d tree is\nproposed. The major contribution achieved by this research is the use of the\nk-d tree data structure for spatial clustering, and comparing its performance\nto the brute-force approach. The results of the work performed in this paper\nrevealed better performance using the k-d tree, compared to the traditional\nbrute-force approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Mar 2013 11:13:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-11"}

Most of these applications would benefit\ngreatly by a reduction in the message delivery delay experienced in the\nnetwork. The delay performance of DTNs is adversely affected by contention,\nespecially severe in the presence of higher traffic rates and node densities.\nMany-to-Many (M2M) communication can handle this contention much better than\ntraditional one-to- one communication employing CSMA. In this paper, for the\nfirst time, we analytically model the expected delivery delay of a DTN\nemploying epidemic routing and M2M communication. The accuracy of our model is\ndemonstrated by matching the analytical results against those from simulations.\nWe also show using simulations that M2M communication significantly improves\nthe delay performance (with respect to one-to-one CSMA) for high contention\nscenarios.

The radio emission at high spatial\nresolution appears structured in a precessing jet with a precessional period of\n27-28 d. Aims: How close is the precessional period of the radio jet to the\norbital period? Any periodicity in the radio emission should be revealed by\ntiming analysis. The aim of this work is to establish the accurate value of the\nprecessional period. Methods: We analyzed 6.7 years of the Green Bank\nInterferometer database at 2.2 GHz and 8.3 GHz with the Lomb-Scargle and phase\ndispersion minimization (PDM) methods and performed simulations. Results: The\nperiodograms show two periodicities, P1 = 26.49 +/- 0.07 d (\\nu1=0.03775\nd^{-1}) and P2 = 26.92 +/- 0.07 d (\\nu2 = 0.03715 d^{-1}).

The period Paverage as well as the\nlong-term modulation Pbeat=1/(\\nu1 - \\nu2)=1667 +/- 393 d result from the beat\nof the two close periods, the orbital P1 and the precessional P2 periods.\nConclusions: The precessional period, indicated by the astrometry to be of\n27--28 d, is P2=26.92 d. The system \\lsi seems to be one more case in astronomy\nof beat, i.e., a phenomenon occurring when two physical processes create stable\nvariations of nearly equal frequencies.

The Lyman alpha emission line of galaxies is an important tool for\nfinding galaxies at high redshift, and thus probe the structure of the early\nuniverse. However, the resonance nature of the line and its sensitivity to dust\nand neutral gas is still not fully understood.\n  Aims. We present measurements of the velocity, covering fraction and optical\ndepth of neutral gas in front of two well known local blue compact galaxies\nthat show Lyman alpha in emission: ESO 338-IG 04 and Haro 11. We thus test\nobservationally the hypothesis that Lyman alpha can escape through neutral gas\nby being Doppler shifted out of resonance.\n  Methods. We present integral field spectroscopy from the GIRAFFE/Argus\nspectrograph at VLT/FLAMES in Paranal, Chile. The excellent wavelength\nresolution allows us to accurately measure the velocity of the ionized and\nneutral gas through the H-alpha emission and Na D absorption, which traces the\nionized medium and cold interstellar gas, respectively. We also present\nindependent measurements with the VLT/X-shooter spectrograph which confirm our\nresults.\n  Results. For ESO 338-IG04, we measure no significant shift of neutral gas.\nThe best fit velocity is -15 (16) km/s. For Haro 11, we see an outflow from\nknot B at 44 (13) km/s and infalling gas towards knot C with 32 (12) km/s.\nBased on the relative strength of the Na D absorption lines, we estimate low\ncovering fractions of neutral gas (down to 10%) in all three cases.\n  Conclusions. The Na D absorption likely occurs in dense clumps with higher\ncolumn densities than where the bulk of the Ly-alpha scattering takes place.\nStill, we find no strong correlation between outflowing neutral gas and a high\nLyman alpha escape fraction. The Lyman alpha photons from these two galaxies\nare therefore likely escaping due to a low column density and/or covering\nfraction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Mar 2013 14:45:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

Using PACS onboard Herschel, we observed six\nPDRs spanning a wide range of FUV radiation fields (G_0=100-10^5). To measure\nthe photoelectric heating efficiency, we obtained the intensities of the main\ncooling lines, i.e., the [OI]63um, 145um, and [CII]158um, as well as the FIR\ncontinuum intensity. We used Spitzer/IRS spectroscopic mapping observations to\ninvestigate the MIR PAH features in the same regions. We decomposed the MIR PAH\nemission into that of neutral (PAH^0) and positively ionized (PAH^+) species to\nderive the fraction of the positively charged PAHs, and compare it to the\nphotoelectric heating efficiency. The heating efficiency traced by\n([OI]63um+[OI]145um+[CII]158um) / TIR, ranges between 0.1% and 0.9% in\ndifferent sources, and the fraction of PAH^+ relative to (PAH^0 + PAH^+) spans\nfrom 0(+11)% to 87(+/-10)%. All positions with a high PAH^+ fraction show a low\nheating efficiency, and all positions with a high heating efficiency have a low\nPAH^+ fraction, supporting the scenario in which a positive grain charge\nresults in a decreased heating efficiency. Theoretical estimates of the\nphotoelectric heating efficiency show a stronger dependence on the charging\nparameter gamma=G_0 T^{1/2}/n_e than the observed efficiency reported in this\nstudy, and the discrepancy is significant at low gamma. The photoelectric\nheating efficiency on PAHs, traced by ([OI]63um+[OI]145um+[CII]158um) /\n(PAH+[OI]63um+[OI]145um+[CII]158um), shows a much better match between the\nobservations and the theoretical estimates. The good agreement of the\nphotoelectric heating efficiency on PAHs with a theoretical model indicates the\ndominant contribution of PAHs to the photoelectric heating.

It is shown that in a typical application\ncase, where uniform data readings are transformed to the same number of\nuniformly spaced frequencies, the results of the classical DFT and proposed\napproach coincide. The difference in performance appears when the length of the\nDFT is selected to be greater than the length of the data. The DFT solves the\nunknown data problem by padding readings with zeros up to the length of the\nDFT, while the proposed Extended DFT (EDFT) deals with this situation in a\ndifferent way, it uses the Fourier integral transform as a target and optimizes\nthe transform basis in the extended frequency range without putting such\nrestrictions on the time domain. Consequently, the Inverse DFT (IDFT) applied\nto the result of EDFT returns not only known readings, but also the\nextrapolated data, where classical DFT is able to give back just zeros, and\nhigher resolution are achieved at frequencies where the data has been\nsuccessfully extended. It has been demonstrated that EDFT able to process data\nwith missing readings or gaps inside or even nonuniformly distributed data.\nThus, EDFT significantly extends the usability of the DFT-based methods, where\npreviously these approaches have been considered as not applicable. The EDFT\nfounds the solution in an iterative way and requires repeated calculations to\nget the adaptive basis, and this makes it numerical complexity much higher\ncompared to DFT. This disadvantage was a serious problem in the 1990s, when the\nmethod has been proposed. Fortunately, since then the power of computers has\nincreased so much that nowadays EDFT application could be considered as a real\nalternative.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Mar 2013 15:47:28 GMT"},{"version":"v10","created":"Sun, 12 Feb 2023 07:42:20 GMT"},{"version":"v11","created":"Wed, 15 Mar 2023 18:33:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 Mar 2013 14:58:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 31 May 2013 13:15:18 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 15 Oct 2013 08:47:43 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 23 Jan 2014 08:39:21 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Fri, 12 Sep 2014 11:43:40 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Mon, 23 Feb 2015 06:29:25 GMT"},{"version":"v8","created":"Thu, 28 Sep 2017 07:26:38 GMT"},{"version":"v9","created":"Tue, 12 Mar 2019 09:20:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-17"}
