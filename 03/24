They have a number of interesting\nproperties and play a role in (Lagrange) interpolation problems, partial\nfraction expansions, and finding solutions to linear ordinary differential\nequations, to mention just a few applications. Usually, one takes these\nmatrices square, $q\\times q$ say, in which case the $i$-th column is given by\n$u(z_i)$, where we write $u(z)=(1,z,...,z^{q-1})^\\top$. If all the $z_i$\n($i=1,...,q$) are different, the Vandermonde matrix is non-singular, otherwise\nnot. The latter case obviously takes place when all $z_i$ are the same, $z$\nsay, in which case one could speak of a confluent Vandermonde matrix.\nNon-singularity is obtained if one considers the matrix $V(z)$ whose $i$-th\ncolumn ($i=1,...,q$) is given by the $(i-1)$-th derivative $u^{(i-1)}(z)^\\top$.\n  We will consider generalizations of the confluent Vandermonde matrix $V(z)$\nby considering matrices obtained by using as building blocks the matrices\n$M(z)=u(z)w(z)$, with $u(z)$ as above and $w(z)=(1,z,...,z^{r-1})$, together\nwith its derivatives $M^{(k)}(z)$.

It turns out that answers can be obtained by factorizing the matrix\ninto a product of other matrix polynomials having a simple structure.

The free parameters of the model are the heavy Higgs mass,\ntan(\\beta) and the \"non-holomorphic\" Yukawa couplings \\epsilon^f_ij\n(f=u,d,\\ell). In our analysis we constrain the elements \\epsilon^f_ij in\nvarious ways: In a first step we give order of magnitude constraints on\n\\epsilon^f_ij from 't Hooft's naturalness criterion. Then we constrain the\nYukawa structure of the type-III 2HDM from tree-level FCNC processes\n(B_s,d->\\mu^+\\mu^-, \\tau^-->\\mu^-\\mu^+\\mu^-, etc.) and observe that all flavor\noff-diagonal elements except \\epsilon^u_32,31 and \\epsilon^u_23,13 must be very\nsmall in order to satisfy the experimental bounds.

For oncogenes\nspecifically, current research suggests that there is a small set of \"driver\"\nmutations that are primarily responsible for tumorigenesis. Further, due to\nsome recent pharmacological successes in treating these driver mutations and\ntheir resulting tumors, a variety of methods have been developed to identify\npotential driver mutations using methods such as machine learning and\nmutational clustering. We propose a novel methodology that increases our power\nto identify mutational clusters by taking into account protein tertiary\nstructure via a graph theoretical approach.\n  Results: We have designed and implemented GraphPAC (Graph Protein Amino Acid\nClustering) to identify mutational clustering while considering protein spatial\nstructure. Using GraphPAC, we are able to detect novel clusters in proteins\nthat are known to exhibit mutation clustering as well as identify clusters in\nproteins without evidence of prior clustering based on current methods.\nSpecifically, by utilizing the spatial information available in the Protein\nData Bank (PDB) along with the mutational data in the Catalogue of Somatic\nMutations in Cancer (COSMIC), GraphPAC identifies new mutational clusters in\nwell known oncogenes such as EGFR and KRAS.

The emission\nlocation coincides with a very weak white-light feature, and is consistent with\nheating below the temperature minimum in the atmosphere. However, there are\nproblems in attributing the heating to accelerated electrons. The peak 30 THz\nflux is several times larger than the usual microwave peak near 9 GHz,\nattributed to non-thermal electrons in the corona. The 30 THz emission could be\nconsistent with an optically thick spectrum increasing from low to high\nfrequencies. It might be part of the same spectral component found at sub-THz\nfrequencies whose nature remains mysterious. Further observations at these\nwavelengths will provide a new window for flare studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Mar 2013 23:43:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

Here we\nmodel the bilayer using a computer assembly procedure that starts from a single\nlayer of amorphous graphene, generated using a bond switching algorithm from an\ninitially crystalline graphene structure. Next each bond is decorated with an\noxygen atom and the carbon atoms are relabeled as silicon. This monolayer can\nbe now thought of as a two dimensional network of corner sharing triangles.\nNext each triangle is made into a tetrahedron, by raising the silicon atom\nabove each triangle and adding an additional singly coordinated oxygen atom at\nthe apex. The final step is to mirror reflect this layer to form a second layer\nand then attach the two layers together to form the bilayer.\n  We show that this vitreous silica bilayer has the additional macroscopic\ndegrees of freedom to easily form a network of identical corner sharing\ntetrahedra if there is a symmetry plane through the center of the bilayer going\nthrough the layer of oxygen ions that join the upper and lower layers. This has\nthe consequence that the upper rings lie exactly above the lower rings, which\nare tilted in general. The assumption of a network of perfect corner sharing\ntetrahedra leads to a range of possible densities that we have previously\ncharacterized in three dimensional zeolites as a flexibility window.

Exploring a large range of models, we generate synthetic\nimages of disks with different degrees of dust settling, and simulate high\nangular resolution (~ 0.05-0.3\") ALMA observations of these synthetic disks.\nThe resulting data sets are then analyzed blindly with homogeneous disk models\n(where dust and gas are totally mixed) and the derived disk parameters are used\nas tracers of the settling factor.

We introduce a new dynamical model for the template update\nusing a random walk on the Riemannian manifold where the covariance descriptors\nlie in. This is done using log-transformed space of the manifold to free the\nconstraints imposed inherently by positive semidefinite matrices. Modeling\ntemplate variations and poses kinetics together in the state space enables us\nto jointly quantify the uncertainties relating to the kinematic states and the\ntemplate in a principled way. Finally, the sequential inference of the\nposterior distribution of the kinematic states and the template is done using a\nparticle filter. Our results shows that this principled approach can be robust\nto changes in illumination, poses and spatial affine transformation. In the\nexperiments, our method outperformed the current state-of-the-art algorithm -\nthe incremental Principal Component Analysis method, particularly when a target\nunderwent fast poses changes and also maintained a comparable performance in\nstable target tracking cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Mar 2013 04:55:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-26"}

It is now largely believed that at\nleast in electron-dominated events the hardening in photon spectrum reflects an\nintrinsic hardening in the source electron spectrum. In this paper, we point\nout that a power law spectrum of electron with a hardening at high energies can\nbe explained by diffusive shock acceleration of electrons at a termination\nshock with a finite width. Our suggestion is based on an early analytical work\nby Drury et al., where the steady state transport equation at a shock with a\ntanh profile was solved for a $p$-independent diffusion coefficient. Numerical\nsimulations with a $p$-dependent diffusion coefficient show hardenings in the\naccelerated electron spectrum which are comparable with observations. One\nnecessary condition for our proposed scenario to work is that high energy\nelectrons resonate with the inertial range of the MHD turbulence and low energy\nelectrons resonate with the dissipation range of the MHD turbulence at the\nacceleration site, and the spectrum of the dissipation range $\\sim k^{-2.7}$. A\n$\\sim k^{-2.7}$ dissipation range spectrum is consistent with recent solar wind\nobservations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Mar 2013 06:54:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

We focus on conditions reminiscent to those of the Earth\nsystem, but our investigation aims at presenting a general methodology for\ndealing with exoplanets. We provide a thorough analysis of the non-equilibrium\nthermodynamical properties of the climate system and explore, using a a\nflexible climate model, how such properties depend on the energy input of the\nparent star, on the infrared atmospheric opacity, and on the rotation rate. It\nis possible to reproduce the multi-stability properties reminiscent of the\npaleoclimatologically relevant snowball (SB) - warm (W) conditions. We then\nstudy the thermodynamics of the W and SB states, clarifying the role of the\nhydrological cycle in shaping the irreversibility and the efficiency of the W\nstates, and emphasizing the extreme diversity of the SB states, where dry\nconditions are realized. Thermodynamics provides the clue for studying the\ntipping points of the system and leads us to constructing parametrizations\nwhere the main thermodynamic properties are expressed as functions of the\nemission temperature of the planet only. Such functions are rather robust with\nrespect to changing the rotation rate of the planet from the current\nterrestrial one to half of it. We then explore the dynamical range of slowy\nrotating and phase locked planets. There is a critical rotation rate below\nwhich the multi-stability properties are lost. Such critical rotation rate\ncorresponds roughly to the phase lock 2:1 condition. Therefore, if an\nEarth-like planet is 1:1 phase locked with respect to the parent star, only one\nclimatic state would be compatible with a given set of astronomical and\nastrophysical parameters. These results have relevance for the general theory\nof planetary circulation and for the definition of necessary and sufficient\nconditions for habitability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Mar 2013 11:10:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

The\nMCRIM technique is a combination of experiment and simulations that allows the\nabsolute light yield of scintillators to be determined by taking into account\neffects of refraction, scattering and absorption in the material.

The solution is given in terms of Jacobi elliptical functions and\nillustrated by several numerical examples and several graphical presentations\nof shapes of deformed cantilever. Possible forms of cantilever underlying\nelastica are discussed in details and various simple formulas are given for\ncalculation of characteristic dimensions of elastica. For the case when\ncantilever is subject only to applied force four load conditions are discussed:\nfollower load problem, load determination problem, conservative load problem\nand rotational load problem. For all the cases the formulas or effective\nprocedure for solution is given.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Mar 2013 16:18:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 27 Mar 2013 10:57:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-28"}
