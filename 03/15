In this paper, we aim to point out the mathematics behind this\nscheme and to answer the following three questions: 1) whether the fixed-point\niteration algorithm converges or not? 2) when it converges, whether the fixed\npoint solution is same as the original solution obtained with the complete DDC\nmatrix? 3) if not the same, whether the fixed point solution is more accurate\nthan the naive solution of the truncated problem obtained without the\nfixed-point iteration?

In\nour system, a customer arrives at one of many designated stations and is\ntransported to any other designated station, either by driving themselves, or\nby being driven by an employed driver. The system allows for one-way trips, so\nthat customers do not have to return to their origin. When some origins and\ndestinations are more popular than others, vehicles will become unbalanced,\naccumulating at some stations and becoming depleted at others. This problem is\naddressed by employing rebalancing drivers to drive vehicles from the popular\ndestinations to the unpopular destinations. However, with this approach the\nrebalancing drivers themselves become unbalanced, and we need to \"rebalance the\nrebalancers\" by letting them travel back to the popular destinations with a\ncustomer. Accordingly, in this paper we study how to optimally route the\nrebalancing vehicles and drivers so that stability (in terms of boundedness of\nthe number of waiting customers) is ensured while minimizing the number of\nrebalancing vehicles traveling in the network and the number of rebalancing\ndrivers needed; surprisingly, these two objectives are aligned, and one can\nfind the optimal rebalancing strategy by solving two decoupled linear programs.\nLeveraging our analysis, we determine the minimum number of drivers and minimum\nnumber of vehicles needed to ensure stability in the system. Interestingly, our\nsimulations suggest that, in Euclidean network topologies, one would need\nbetween 1/3 and 1/4 as many drivers as vehicles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Mar 2013 17:37:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-15"}

Although deeper multi-band observations of the\nfield of B1608+656 are necessary to obtain a more precise estimate, we conclude\nthat griK photometry, in addition to spectroscopy to characterize the immediate\nenvironment, is an effective way to increase the precision of time-delay\ncosmography.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Mar 2013 20:00:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

Aims : We study the formation of a penumbra in a decaying sunspot and\ncompare its properties with those seen during the development of a proto-spot.\nMethods : High-resolution spectropolarimetric observations of active region\nNOAA 11283 were obtained from the spectro-polarimeter on board Hinode. These\nwere complemented with full-disk filtergrams of continuum intensity,\nline-of-sight magnetograms, and dopplergrams from the Helioseismic and Magnetic\nImager at high cadence. Results : The formation of a penumbra in the decaying\nsunspot occurs after the coalescence of the sunspot with a magnetic\nfragment/pore, which initially formed in the quiet Sun close to an emerging\nflux region. At first, a smaller set of penumbral filaments develop near the\nlocation of the merger with very bright penumbral grains with intensities of\n1.2 I_QS, upflows of 4 km/s, and a lifetime of 10 hr. During the decay of these\nfilaments, a larger segment of a penumbra forms at the location of the\ncoalescence. These new filaments are characterized by nearly supersonic\ndownflows of 6.5 km/s that change to a regular Evershed flow nearly 3 hr later.\nConclusions : The coalescence of the pore with the decaying sunspot provided\nsufficient magnetic flux for the penumbra to form in the sunspot. The emerging\nflux region could have played a decisive role in this process because the\nformation occurred at the location of the merger and not on the opposite side\nof the sunspot.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Mar 2013 20:42:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

Two of the\nchallenging questions in such environments are (1) choosing suitable values for\nMapReduce configuration parameters e.g., number of mappers, number of reducers,\nand DFS block size, and (2) predicting the amount of resources that a user\nshould lease from the service provider. Currently, the tasks of both choosing\nconfiguration parameters and estimating required resources are solely the users\nresponsibilities. In this paper, we present an approach to provision the total\nCPU usage in clock cycles of jobs in MapReduce environment. For a MapReduce\njob, a profile of total CPU usage in clock cycles is built from the job past\nexecutions with different values of two configuration parameters e.g., number\nof mappers, and number of reducers. Then, a polynomial regression is used to\nmodel the relation between these configuration parameters and total CPU usage\nin clock cycles of the job. We also briefly study the influence of input data\nscaling on measured total CPU usage in clock cycles. This derived model along\nwith the scaling result can then be used to provision the total CPU usage in\nclock cycles of the same jobs with different input data size. We validate the\naccuracy of our models using three realistic applications (WordCount, Exim\nMainLog parsing, and TeraSort). Results show that the predicted total CPU usage\nin clock cycles of generated resource provisioning options are less than 8% of\nthe measured total CPU usage in clock cycles in our 20-node virtual Hadoop\ncluster.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Mar 2013 22:40:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-18"}

Two subsystems are\ninterconnected in a nested information pattern, and output feedback controllers\nmust be designed for each subsystem. Several special cases of this architecture\nhave previously been solved, such as the state-feedback case or the case where\nthe dynamics of both systems are decoupled. In this paper, we present a\ndetailed solution to the general case. The structure of the optimal\ndecentralized controller is reminiscent of that of the optimal centralized\ncontroller; each player must estimate the state of the system given their\navailable information and apply static control policies to these estimates to\ncompute the optimal controller. The previously solved cases benefit from a\nseparation between estimation and control which allows one to compute the\ncontrol and estimation gains separately. This feature is not present in\ngeneral, and some of the gains must be solved for simultaneously. We show that\ncomputing the required coupled estimation and control gains amounts to solving\na small system of linear equations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Mar 2013 00:15:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Jan 2014 08:44:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 18 Feb 2014 06:39:46 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 9 Jul 2015 02:22:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-10"}

By analyzing within-patient longitudinal\nsequence data, we make four observations that shed a light on the underlying\nprocesses and allow us infer the short-term effective population size of the\nviral population in a patient. Our first observation is that the evolution of\ndrug resistance usually occurs by the fixation of one drug-resistance mutation\nat a time, as opposed to several changes simultaneously. Second, we find that\nthese fixation events are accompanied by a reduction in genetic diversity in\nthe region surrounding the fixed drug-resistance mutation, due to the\nhitchhiking effect. Third, we observe that the fixation of drug-resistance\nmutations involves both hard and soft selective sweeps. In a hard sweep, a\nresistance mutation arises in a single viral particle and drives all linked\nmutations with it when it spreads in the viral population, which dramatically\nreduces genetic diversity. On the other hand, in a soft sweep, a resistance\nmutation occurs multiple times on different genetic backgrounds, and the\nreduction of diversity is weak. Using the frequency of occurrence of hard and\nsoft sweeps we estimate the effective population size of HIV to be 1.5 * 10^5\n(95% confidence interval 0.8 * 10^5, 4.8 * 10^5). This number is much lower\nthan the actual number of infected cells, but much larger than previous\npopulation size estimates based on synonymous diversity. We propose several\nexplanations for the observed discrepancies. Finally, our fourth observation is\nthat genetic diversity at non-synonymous sites recovers to its pre-fixation\nvalue within 18 months, whereas diversity at synonymous sites remains depressed\nafter this time period.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Mar 2013 03:19:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Jul 2013 21:08:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 14 Nov 2013 15:50:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-15"}

This generally introduces new sources of flavour\nviolation and CP violation as well as left-handed and right-handed scalar\ncurrents. These new physics contributions imply a pattern of deviations from SM\nexpectations for FCNC processes that depends only on the couplings of H^0(A^0)\nto fermions and on their masses. In situations in which a single H^0 or A^0\ndominates NP contributions stringent correlations between Delta F=2 and Delta\nF=1 observables exist. Anticipating the Flavour Precision Era ahead of us we\nillustrate this by searching for allowed oases in the landscape of a given\nmodel assuming significantly smaller uncertainties in CKM and hadronic\nparameters than presently available. To this end we analyze Delta F=2\nobservables in B^0_{s,d}-bar B^0_{s,d} and K^0-bar K^0 systems and rare B and K\ndecays with charged leptons in the final state including both left-handed and\nright-handed scalar couplings of H^0 and A^0 to quarks in various combinations.\nWe identify a number of correlations between various flavour observables that\ncould test and distinguish these different scenarios. The prominent role of the\ndecays B_{s,d}-> mu^+ mu^- in these studies is emphasized. Imposing the\nexisting flavour constraints, a rich pattern of deviations from the SM\nexpectations in rare B_{s,d} decays emerges provided M_H< 1 TeV. NP effects in\nrare K decays are very small. Neutral SM Higgs contributions to rare B and K\ndecays turn out to be negligible once the constraints from Delta F=2 processes\nare taken into account.

In this paper we focus on the 69mu emission band of the\ncrystalline silicate forsterite.\n  Aims: This work provides an overview of the 69mu forsterite bands in the\nDIGIT sample. We aim to derive the temperature and composition of the\nforsterite grains. With this information, constraints can be placed on the\nspatial distribution of the forsterite in the disk and its formation history.\n  Methods: Position and shape of the 69mu band are used to derive the\ntemperature and composition of the dust by comparison to laboratory spectra of\nthat band. We combine our data with existing Spitzer IRS spectra to compare the\npresence and strength of the 69mu band to the forsterite bands at shorter\nwavelengths.\n  Results: A total of 32 sources have been observed, 8 of them show a 69mu\nemission band that can be attributed to forsterite. With the exception of the\nT-Tauri star AS205, all of the detections are for disks associated with Herbig\nAe/Be stars. Most of the forsterite grains that give rise to the 69mu bands are\nwarm (~100-200 K) and iron-poor (less than ~2% iron). Only AB-Aur requires\napproximately 3-4% of iron.\n  Conclusions: Our findings support the hypothesis that the forsterite grains\nform through an equilibrium condensation process at high temperatures. The\nconnection between the strength of the 69 and 33mu bands shows that at least\npart of the emission in these bands originates from the same dust grains.\nFurther, any model that explains the PACS and the Spitzer IRS observations must\ntake the effects of a wavelength dependent optical depth into account. We find\nindications of a correlation of the detection rate of the 69mu band with the\nspectral type of the host stars. However, our sample is too small to obtain a\ndefinitive result.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Mar 2013 11:52:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

Using a\ncanonical transformation of the dynamical variables, which Abelianises the\nnon-Abelian Gauss-law constraints to be implemented, such a reformulation can\nbe achieved for QCD. The exact implementation of the Gauss laws reduces the\ncolored spin-1 gluons and spin-1/2 quarks to unconstrained colorless spin-0,\nspin-1, spin-2 and spin-3 glueball fields and colorless Rarita-Schwinger fields\nrespectively. The obtained physical Hamiltonian can then be rewritten into a\nform, which separates the rotational from the scalar degrees of freedom, and\nadmits a systematic strong-coupling expansion in powers of lambda=g^{-2/3},\nequivalent to an expansion in the number of spatial derivatives.

The time evolution is\ntreated by a splitting scheme in coordinate space using alternate direction\niteration, while the wave function is discretized spatially on a uniform grid.\nThe longitudinal coordinate evolution is performed exactly by the method of\ncharacteristics while the radial coordinates evolution uses Poisson's integral\nsolution, which allows to implement the radial symmetry of the wave function.\nThe latter is evaluated on a time staggered mesh by using Hermite polynomial\ninterpolation and by performing the integration analytically.

We are able to trace separately the\nevolution of the number density of blue and red galaxies with masses above\n10^11.4 M_sun, in a mass range barely studied in previous work. We find that\nfor such large masses, red galaxies show a milder evolution with redshift, when\ncompared to objects at lower masses.
