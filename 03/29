Conventionally associated with\nthe limits where the phonon frequency is either sufficiently small or\nsufficiently large as compared to the bare electronic hopping rate, we show\nthat the crossover between the two regimes is governed for strong\nelectron-phonon interactions primarily by the polaronic shift rather than the\nphonon frequency. In particular, the perturbative adiabatic limit is approached\nonly as the bare hopping rate \\Gamma exceeds the polaronic shift, leaving an\nextended window of couplings where \\Gamma well exceeds the phonon frequency and\nyet the physics is basically that of the antiadiabatic regime. We term this\nintermediate regime the extended antiadiabatic regime.

He calculated the work necessary to keep the\ncavity moving at a constant velocity as it fills with radiation and concluded\nthat the radiation energy has associated with it an apparent mass such that E =\n3/8 mc^2. Also in 1904, Hasenohrl achieved the same result by computing the\nforce necessary to accelerate a cavity already filled with radiation. In early\n1905, he corrected the latter result to E = 3/4 mc^2. In this paper,\nHasenohrl's papers are examined from a modern, relativistic point of view in an\nattempt to understand where he went wrong. The primary mistake in his first\npaper was, ironically, that he didn't account for the loss of mass of the\nblackbody end caps as they radiate energy into the cavity. However, even taking\nthis into account one concludes that blackbody radiation has a mass equivalent\nof m = 4/3 E/c^2 or m = 5/3 E/c^2 depending on whether one equates the momentum\nor kinetic energy of radiation to the momentum or kinetic energy of an\nequivalent mass. In his second and third papers that deal with an accelerated\ncavity, Hasenohrl concluded that the mass associated with blackbody radiation\nis m = 4/3 E/c^2, a result which, within the restricted context of Hasenohrl's\ngedanken experiment, is actually consistent with special relativity. Both of\nthese problems are non-trivial and the surprising results, indeed, turn out to\nbe relevant to the \"4/3 problem\" in classical models of the electron. An\nimportant lesson of these analyses is that E = mc^2, while extremely useful, is\nnot a \"law of physics\" in the sense that it ought not be applied\nindiscriminately to any extended system and, in particular, to the subsystems\nfrom which they are comprised.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Mar 2013 16:10:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

The efficiency of the process\nis currently limited when on resonance due to the absorption of the 420 nm\nbeam, and modifications should allow a significant increase in output power.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Mar 2013 16:45:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 12 Jun 2013 19:47:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-13"}

A gap-opening secondary close to the primary will\nleave an imprint in the broad component of the FeKa emission line, which varies\nin a unique and predictable manner. If the gap persists into the innermost\ndisk, the effect consists of a pair of dips in the broad line which ripple\nblue-ward and red-ward from the line centroid energy respectively, as the gap\nmoves closer to the primary. This ripple effect could be unambiguously\ndetectable and allow an electromagnetic monitoring of massive black hole\nmergers as they occur. As the mass ratio of the secondary to primary black hole\nincreases to q>0.01, we expect the gap to widen, possibly clearing a central\ncavity in the inner disk, which shows up in the broad FeKa line component. If\nthe secondary stalls at >100r_{g} in its in-migration, due to low co-rotating\ngas mass, a detectable ripple effect occurs in the broad line component on the\ndisk viscous timescale as the inner disk drains and the outer disk is dammed.\nIf the secondary maintains an accretion disk within a central cavity, due to\ndam bursting or leakage, a periodic 'see-saw' oscillation effect is exhibited\nin the observed line profile.

For each of them, the existing work\nhas mainly focused on special cases. With new angles and tools, this paper\nmakes progress in relaxing some assumptions of these factors. There are three\nmain results in this paper. First, by using results from algebraic graph\ntheory, a sufficient condition is obtained which can be used to check\nequilibrium stability. This condition works for arbitrary topology. It\ngeneralizes existing results and also leads to a sufficient condition on the\ncoupling function with which the system is guaranteed to reach synchronization.\nSecond, it is known that identical oscillators with sin() coupling functions\nare guaranteed to synchronize in phase on a complete graph. Using our results,\nwe demonstrate that for many cases certain structures instead of exact shape of\nthe coupling function such as symmetry and concavity are the keys for global\nsynchronization. Finally, the effect of heterogenous delays is investigated. We\ndevelop a new framework by constructing a non-delayed phase model that\napproximates the original one in the continuum limit. We further derive how its\nstability properties depend on the delay distribution. In particular, we show\nthat heterogeneity, i.e. wider delay distribution, can help reach in-phase\nsynchronization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Mar 2013 20:33:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

This so-called \"measurement\nproblem\" is tackled with two guidelines. On the one hand, the dynamics of the\nmacroscopic apparatus A coupled to the tested system S is described\nmathematically within a standard quantum formalism, where \"q-probablities\"\nremain devoid of interpretation. On the other hand, interpretative principles\nare introduced to account for the expected features of ideal measurements. Most\nof the five principles, which relate the quantum formalism to physical reality,\nare straightforward and refer to macroscopic variables. The process can be\nidentified with a relaxation of S+A to thermodynamic equilibrium, not only for\na large ensemble $\\scriptE$ of runs but even for its sub-ensembles. The\ndifferent mechanisms of quantum statistical dynamics that ensure the relaxation\nare exhibited. The additional information provided by the sub-ensembles remove\nSchr\\\"odinger's quantum ambiguity of the final density operator for $\\scriptE$\nwhich hinders its direct interpretation, and bring out a commutative behaviour\nof the pointer observable at the final time. The latter property supports the\nintroduction of a last principle, needed to switch from the statistical\nensembles and sub-ensembles described by quantum theory to individual\nexperimental events. It amounts to identify some formal \"q-probabilities\" with\nordinary frequencies, but only those which refer to the final pointer\nindications. The desired properties of ideal measurements, in particular the\nuniqueness of the result for each individual run and von Neumann's reduction,\nare thereby recovered with economic interpretations. The status of Born's rule\ninvolving both A and S is re-evaluated, and contextuality is made obvious.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Mar 2013 21:09:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 Feb 2015 15:26:28 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 12 Jun 2016 07:47:39 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 6 Nov 2016 20:51:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-04"}

Also curvature, curvature square terms and for scale\ninvariance a dilaton field $\\phi$ are considered in the action. The first order\nformalism is applied. The integration of the equations of motion associated\nwith the new measure gives rise to the spontaneous symmetry breaking (S.S.B) of\nscale invariance (S.I.). After S.S.B. of S.I., it is found that a non trivial\npotential for the dilaton is generated. In the Einstein frame we also add a\ncosmological term that parametrizes the zero point fluctuations. The resulting\neffective potential for the dilaton contains two flat regions, for $\\phi\n\\rightarrow \\infty$ relevant for the non singular origin of the Universe,\nfollowed by an inflationary phase and $\\phi \\rightarrow -\\infty$, describing\nour present Universe. The dynamics of the scalar field becomes non linear and\nthese non linearities produce a non trivial vacuum structure for the theory and\nare responsible for the stability of some of the emergent universe solutions,\nwhich exists for a parameter range of values of the vacuum energy in $\\phi\n\\rightarrow -\\infty$, which must be positive but not very big, avoiding the\nextreme fine tuning required to keep the vacuum energy density of the present\nuniverse small. The non trivial vacuum structure is crucial to ensure the\nsmooth transition from the emerging phase, to an inflationary phase and finally\nto the slowly accelerated universe now. Zero vacuum energy density for the\npresent universe defines the threshold for the creation of the universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Mar 2013 22:45:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 10 May 2013 14:55:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

This new algorithm incorporates measurement errors into the\ncalculation while also dealing efficiently with missing values in the data. In\naddition, our implementation of this algorithm provides supplementary\ninformation regarding the data being analyzed, including unbiased estimates of\nthe accuracy of the technique without resorting to a validation data set,\nidentification of poor photometric redshift areas within the parameter space\noccupied by the spectroscopic training data, a quantification of the relative\nimportance of the variables used to construct the PDF, and a robust\nidentification of outliers. This extra information can be used to optimally\ntarget new spectroscopic observations and to improve the overall efficacy of\nthe redshift estimation. We have tested TPZ on galaxy samples drawn from the\nSDSS main galaxy sample and from the DEEP2 survey, obtaining excellent results\nin each case. We also have tested our implementation by participating in the\nPHAT1 project, which is a blind photometric redshift contest, finding that TPZ\nperforms comparable to if not better than other empirical photometric redshift\nalgorithms.

Here\nwe develop an original framework for measuring how a publication's citation\nrate $\\Delta c$ depends on the reputation of its central author $i$, in\naddition to its net citation count $c$. To estimate the strength of the\nreputation effect, we perform a longitudinal analysis on the careers of 450\nhighly-cited scientists, using the total citations $C_{i}$ of each scientist as\nhis/her reputation measure. We find a citation crossover $c_{\\times}$ which\ndistinguishes the strength of the reputation effect. For publications with $c <\nc_{\\times}$, the author's reputation is found to dominate the annual citation\nrate. Hence, a new publication may gain a significant early advantage\ncorresponding to roughly a 66% increase in the citation rate for each tenfold\nincrease in $C_{i}$. However, the reputation effect becomes negligible for\nhighly cited publications meaning that for $c\\geq c_{\\times}$ the citation rate\nmeasures scientific impact more transparently.

Recently, adaptive\nmodulation schemes using Latin Squares to obtain network coding maps with the\ndenoise and forward protocol have been reported with good end-to-end\nperformance. These schemes work based on avoiding the detrimental effects of\ndistance shortening in the effective receive constellation at the end of the MA\nphase at the relay. The channel fade states that create such distance\nshortening called singular fade states, are effectively removed using\nappropriate Latin squares.

The Ba II D2 line at 4554 A is a\nprominent example, where the F-state interference effects due to the odd\nisotopes produce polarization profiles, which are very different from those of\nthe even isotopes that have no F-state interference. It is therefore necessary\nto account for the contributions from the different isotopes to understand the\nobserved linear polarization profiles of this line. Here we do radiative\ntransfer modeling with partial frequency redistribution (PRD) of such\nobservations while accounting for the interference effects and isotope\ncomposition. The Ba II D2 polarization profile is found to be strongly governed\nby the PRD mechanism. We show how a full PRD treatment succeeds in reproducing\nthe observations, while complete frequency redistribution (CRD) alone fails to\nproduce polarization profiles that have any resemblance with the observed ones.\nHowever, we also find that the line center polarization is sensitive to the\ntemperature structure of the model atmosphere. To obtain a good fit to the line\ncenter peak of the observed Stokes Q/I profile, a small modification of the\nFALX model atmosphere is needed, by lowering the temperature in the\nline-forming layers. Because of the pronounced temperature sensitivity of the\nBa II D2 line it may not be a suitable tool for Hanle magnetic-field\ndiagnostics of the solar chromosphere, because there is currently no\nstraightforward way to separate the temperature and magnetic-field effects from\neach other.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Mar 2013 06:08:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

The $\\gamma$-ray signals\nobtained with high statistical significance allow the determination of\n$\\gamma$-ray spectra above 300~MeV with adequate precision for extraction of\nthe energy distributions of CRs in these clouds. Remarkably, both the derived\nspectral indices and the absolute fluxes of CR protons in the energy interval\n$10 - 100~ \\rm \\ GeV$ agree with the recent direct measurements of local CRs by\nthe PAMELA experiment. This is strong evidence of a quite homogeneous\ndistribution of CRs, at least within several hundred parsecs of the Local\nGalaxy. Combined with the well established energy-dependent time of escape of\nCRs from the Galaxy, $\\tau(E) \\propto E^{-\\delta}$ with $\\delta \\approx\n0.5-0.6$, the measured spectrum implies a CR spectral index of the\n(acceleration) source of $\\approx$E$^{-2.3}$.

Homogeneity arises when one expects regression\ncoefficients corresponding to neighboring geographical regions or a similar\ncluster of covariates to be approximately the same. Sparsity corresponds to a\nspecial case of homogeneity with a known atom zero. In this article, we propose\na new method called clustering algorithm in regression via data-driven\nsegmentation (CARDS) to explore homogeneity. New mathematics are provided on\nthe gain that can be achieved by exploring homogeneity. Statistical properties\nof two versions of CARDS are analyzed. In particular, the asymptotic normality\nof our proposed CARDS estimator is established, which reveals better estimation\naccuracy for homogeneous parameters than that without homogeneity exploration.\nWhen our methods are combined with sparsity exploration, further efficiency can\nbe achieved beyond the exploration of sparsity alone. This provides additional\ninsights into the power of exploring low-dimensional strucuture in\nhigh-dimensional regression: homogeneity and sparsity. The newly developed\nmethod is further illustrated by simulation studies and applications to real\ndata.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Mar 2013 14:34:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-01"}

We exploit HARPS-N high-precision radial velocity measurements\nobtained during a transit to measure the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect in the\nQatar-1 system, and out-of-transit measurements to redetermine the\nspectroscopic orbit. New photometric transit light-curves are analysed and a\nspectroscopic characterisation of the host star atmospheric parameters is\nperformed based on various methods (line equivalent width ratios, spectral\nsynthesis, spectral energy distribution). We achieved a significant improvement\nin the accuracy of the orbital parameters and derived the spin-orbit alignment\nof the system; this information, combined with the spectroscopic determination\nof the host star properties, allows us to derive the fundamental physical\nparameters for star and planet (masses and radii). The orbital solution for the\nQatar-1 system is consistent with a circular orbit and the system presents a\nsky-projected obliquity of lambda = -8.4+-7.1 deg. The planet, with a mass of\n1.33+-0.05 M_J, is found to be significantly more massive than previously\nreported. The host star is confirmed to be metal-rich ([Fe/H]= 0.20+-0.10) and\nslowly rotating (vsinI = 1.7+-0.3 km/s), though moderately active, as indicated\nby strong chromospheric emission in the Ca II H&K line cores (logR'_HK about\n-4.60).

Life may have started\nfrom systems with single heritable elements that are functionally equivalent to\na nucleotide. The genetic complexity, roughly measured by the number of\nnon-redundant functional nucleotides, is expected to have grown exponentially\ndue to several positive feedback factors: gene cooperation, duplication of\ngenes with their subsequent specialization, and emergence of novel functional\nniches associated with existing genes. Linear regression of genetic complexity\non a log scale extrapolated back to just one base pair suggests the time of the\norigin of life 9.7 billion years ago. This cosmic time scale for the evolution\nof life has important consequences: life took ca. 5 billion years to reach the\ncomplexity of bacteria; the environments in which life originated and evolved\nto the prokaryote stage may have been quite different from those envisaged on\nEarth; there was no intelligent life in our universe prior to the origin of\nEarth, thus Earth could not have been deliberately seeded with life by\nintelligent aliens; Earth was seeded by panspermia; experimental replication of\nthe origin of life from scratch may have to emulate many cumulative rare\nevents; and the Drake equation for guesstimating the number of civilizations in\nthe universe is likely wrong, as intelligent life has just begun appearing in\nour universe. Evolution of advanced organisms has accelerated via development\nof additional information-processing systems: epigenetic memory, primitive\nmind, multicellular brain, language, books, computers, and Internet.
