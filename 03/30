In our work, we bridge this gap and present a combined query\nanswering approach for ELHO---a logic that contains all features of the OWL 2\nEL standard apart from transitive roles and complex role inclusions. This\nextension is nontrivial because nominals require equality reasoning, which\nintroduces complexity into the first and the third step. Our empirical\nevaluation suggests that our technique is suitable for practical application,\nand so it provides a practical basis for conjunctive query answering in a large\nfragment of OWL 2 EL.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Mar 2013 16:07:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Apr 2013 17:08:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-02"}

New\nchannels becoming important at 13 and 14 TeV for low values of tan beta are\ncharacterised in terms of their kinematics and the reconstruction strategies.\nThe effect of QCD systematics, SUSY loop effects and decays into pairs of SUSY\nparticles on these constraints are discussed in details.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Mar 2013 18:10:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-10"}

This causes instabilities, which lead to wave\ngrowth at specific resonant wave numbers, especially within shock regions.\nThese amplified wave modes influence the turbulent scattering process\nsignificantly. In this paper, results of particle transport and scattering in\nturbulent plasmas with excited wave modes are presented. The method used is a\nhybrid simulation code, which treats the heliospheric turbulence by an\nincompressible magnetohydrodynamic approach separately from a kinetic particle\ndescription. Furthermore, a semi-analytical model using quasilinear theory\n(QLT) is compared to the numerical results. This paper aims at a more\nfundamental understanding and interpretation of the pitch-angle scattering\ncoefficients. Our calculations show a good agreement of particle simulations\nand the QLT for broad-band turbulent spectra; for higher turbulence levels and\nparticle beam driven plasmas, the QLT approximation gets worse. Especially the\nresonance gap at $\\mu=0$ poses a well-known problem for QLT for steep\nturbulence spectra, whereas test-particle computations show no problems for the\nparticles to scatter across this region. The reason is that the sharp resonant\nwave--particle interactions in QLT are an oversimplification of the broader\nresonances in test-particle calculations, which result from nonlinear effects\nnot included in the QLT. We emphasise the importance of these results for both\nnumerical simulations and analytical particle transport approaches, especially\nthe validity of the QLT.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Mar 2013 19:24:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-01"}

In addition, when nesting is further suppressed and in presence of\na nearest-neighbor attraction, a triplet time-reversal breaking (p_x +\nip_y)-wave pairing instability emerges, competing with the d_{x2+y2} pairing\nstate that is known to dominate at fillings just slightly away from half.

A key finding is that\nthe distribution of receptive-field sizes is scale-invariant over a wide range\nof values, so there is no characteristic receptive-field size selected by\nnatural image statistics. The Gabor-function aspect ratio is found to be\napproximately conserved by the learning rules and is therefore not\nwell-determined by natural image statistics. This allows for three distinct\nsolutions: a basis of Gabor functions with sharp orientation resolution at the\nexpense of spatial-frequency resolution; a basis of Gabor functions with sharp\nspatial-frequency resolution at the expense of orientation resolution; or a\nbasis with unit aspect ratio.

Given a random\nvariable $X$, the problem of estimating its expected value $\\mu$ is addressed.\nThe standard approach is to use the sample mean as an estimator $\\bar x$. In\nimportance sampling, a suitable variable $L$ is introduced such that the random\nvariable $X/L$ has an estimator with a smaller variance than that of $\\bar x$.\nAs a result, a smaller sample size can lead to the same estimation accuracy.\n  In the simulation of reinsurance financial terms for catastrophe loss,\nchoosing a general variable $L$ is difficult: Even before the application of\nfinancial terms, the loss distribution is often not modelled by a closed-form\ndistribution. After that, a wide range of financial terms can be applied that\nmakes the final distribution unpredictable. However, it is evident that the\nheavy tail of the resulting net loss distribution makes the use of importance\nsampling desirable. We propose an importance sampling technique using a power\nfunction transformation on the cumulative distribution function. The benefit of\nthis technique is that no prior knowledge of the loss distribution is required.\nIt is a new technique that has not been documented in the literature. The\ntransformation depends on the choice of the exponent $k$.

However, contrary\nto that prediction, in a recent experimental work T\\\"onshoff and Bettinger [\nAngew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2010, 49, 4125] demonstrated that nonacene has a singlet\nground state.

SN 2012au's spectra almost one year after explosion show a blend of\npersistent Fe II P-Cyg absorptions and nebular emissions originating from two\ndistinct velocity regions.

Nucleation occurs when surface wetting\nbecomes unstable, as the chemical energy gain (scaling with area) overcomes the\nelastic energy penalty (scaling with volume). The nucleation barrier thus\ndecreases with the area-to-volume ratio and vanishes below a critical size, and\nnanoparticles tend to transform in order of increasing size, leaving the\nsmallest particles homogeneous (in the phase of lowest surface energy).

In the fields\nof population and evolutionary genetics, measures of genetic differentiation\nare commonly used to gather this information. One potential caveat is that\nthese measures assume gene flow to be symmetric. However, asymmetric gene flow\nis common in nature, especially in systems driven by physical processes such as\nwind or water currents. Since information about levels of asymmetric gene flow\namong populations is essential for the correct interpretation of the\ndistribution of contemporary genetic diversity within species, this should not\nbe overlooked. To obtain information on asymmetric migration patterns from\ngenetic data, complex models based on maximum likelihood or Bayesian approaches\ngenerally need to be employed, often at great computational cost. Here, a new\nsimpler and more efficient approach for understanding gene flow patterns is\npresented. This approach allows the estimation of directional components of\ngenetic divergence between pairs of populations at low computational effort,\nusing any of the classical or modern measures of genetic differentiation. These\ndirectional measures of genetic differentiation can further be used to\ncalculate directional relative migration and to detect asymmetries in gene flow\npatterns. This can be done in a user-friendly web application called\ndivMigrate-online introduced in this paper. Using simulated data sets with\nknown gene flow regimes, we demonstrate that the method is capable of resolving\ncomplex migration patterns under a range of study designs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Mar 2013 15:30:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 Aug 2013 04:52:02 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 26 Sep 2016 13:56:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-27"}

The chemistry\ncontains a large number of spontaneous reactions of which a small subset could\nbe catalyzed by molecules produced in the chemistry with varying catalytic\nstrengths. We show ACSs, if present in the catalytic network, can focus the\nresources of the system into a sparse set of molecules. ACSs can produce a\nbistability in the population dynamics and, in particular, steady states\nwherein the ACS molecules dominate the population, i.e., have higher\nconcentrations compared to the rest of molecules in the chemistry (background).\nIn this thesis we attempt to address two main questions: First, under what\ncircumstances do molecules belonging to the ACSs dominate over the background,\nand second, starting from an initial condition that does not contain good\ncatalysts, can a sparse set of large molecules (containing several tens or a\nfew hundred monomers) that are good catalysts arise and be maintained in the\nsystem at concentrations significantly above the background? We show that if an\nACS catalyzed by large molecules contains within it (or partially overlaps\nwith) a smaller ACS catalyzed by smaller molecules (referred to as a `nested\nACS' structure), the catalytic strength required for the large ACS to dominate\ncomes down significantly. We show that when the network contains a cascade of\nnested ACSs with the catalytic strengths of molecules increasing gradually with\ntheir size, a sparse subset of molecules including some very large molecules\ncan come to dominate the system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Mar 2013 21:09:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-03"}

It\nhas been speculated that super rotors may exhibit a number of unique\nproperties. Theoretical studies showed that ultrafast molecular rotation may\nchange the character of molecular scattering from solid surfaces, alter\nmolecular trajectories in external fields, make super rotors stable against\ncollisions, and lead to the formation of gas vortices. New ways of molecular\ncooling and selective chemical bond breaking by ultrafast spinning have been\nsuggested. Bringing a large number of molecules to fast, directional and\nsynchronous rotation is rather challenging. An efficient method of accelerating\nmolecular rotation with an \"optical centrifuge\" has been proposed and\nsuccessfully implemented, yet only indirect evidence of super rotors has been\nreported to date. Here we demonstrate the first direct observation of molecular\nsuper rotors and study their spectroscopic, dynamical and magneto-optical\nproperties. Using the centrifuge technique, we control the degree of rotational\nexcitation and detect molecular rotation with high spectral and temporal\nresolution. Frequency-resolved detection enables us to map out the energy of\nextreme rotation levels, two orders of magnitude above the room temperature\nlimit, and quantify the onset of the centrifugal distortion. Femtosecond time\nresolution reveals highly coherent rotational dynamics with lower de-coherence\nrates at higher values of the molecular angular momentum, and the increase of\nthe molecular moment of inertia due to the rotation-induced chemical bond\nstretching. In the presence of an external magnetic field, ultrafast molecular\nrotation is found to result in an optical birefringence of the molecular\nensemble.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Mar 2013 00:43:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 11 Apr 2013 01:18:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 10 Jun 2013 18:04:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-11"}
