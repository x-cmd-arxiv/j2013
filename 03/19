We consider symmetries which include a Z_2\nsubgroup, that allows us to define domain walls. While the usual disordered\nphase is obtained by proliferating domain walls, we show that SPT phases are\nrealized when these proliferated domain walls are `decorated', i.e. are\nthemselves SPT phases in one lower dimension. For example a d=2 SPT phase with\nZ_2 and time reversal symmetry is realized when the domain walls that\nproliferate are themselves in a d=1 Haldane/AKLT state. Similarly, d=3 SPT\nphases with Z_2 * Z_2 symmetry emerges when domain walls in a d=2 SPT with Z_2\nsymmetry are proliferated. The resulting ground states are shown to be\nequivalent to that obtained from group cohomology and field theoretical\ntechniques. The result of gauging the Z_2 symmetry in these phases is also\ndiscussed. An extension of this construction where time reversal plays the role\nof Z_2 symmetry allows for a discussion of several d=3 SPT phases. This\nconstruction also leads to a new perspective on some well known d=1 SPT phases,\nfrom which exactly soluble parent Hamiltonians may be derived.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Mar 2013 16:02:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-31"}

Risaliti et al. have\nrecently attempted to model the hard X-ray excess in the type 1.8 AGN NGC 1365,\nconcluding that the hard excess most likely arises from Compton-scattered\nreflection of X-rays from an inner accretion disk close to the black hole.\nTheir analysis disfavored a model in which the hard excess arises from a high\ncolumn density of circumnuclear gas partially covering a primary X-ray source,\ndespite such components being required in the NGC 1365 data below 10 keV. Using\na Monte Carlo radiative transfer approach, we demonstrate that this conclusion\nis invalidated by (i) use of slab absorption models, which have unrealistic\ntransmission spectra for partial covering gas, (ii) neglect of the effect of\nCompton scattering on transmitted spectra and (iii) inadequate modeling of the\nspectrum of scattered X-rays. The scattered spectrum is geometry dependent and,\nfor high global covering factors, may dominate above 10 keV. We further show\nthat, in models of circumnuclear gas, the suppression of the observed hard\nX-ray flux by reprocessing may be no larger than required by the `light\nbending' model invoked for inner disk reflection, and the expected emission\nline strengths lie within the observed range.

This is a well known\nfinancial puzzle to explain, since assuming foreign exchange risk is\nuninhibited and the markets have rational risk-neutral investors, then one\nwould not expect profits from such strategies. That is uncovered interest rate\nparity (UIP), the parity condition in which exposure to foreign exchange risk,\nwith unanticipated changes in exchange rates, should result in an outcome that\nchanges in the exchange rate should offset the potential to profit from such\ninterest rate differentials. The two primary assumptions required for interest\nrate parity are related to capital mobility and perfect substitutability of\ndomestic and foreign assets. Given foreign exchange market equilibrium, the\ninterest rate parity condition implies that the expected return on domestic\nassets will equal the exchange rate-adjusted expected return on foreign\ncurrency assets.\n  However, it has been shown empirically, that investors can actually earn\narbitrage profits by borrowing in a country with a lower interest rate,\nexchanging for foreign currency, and investing in a foreign country with a\nhigher interest rate, whilst allowing for any losses (or gains) from exchanging\nback to their domestic currency at maturity.

We quantify the locations, sizes and statistical\nsignificance of the density structure, i.e. gaps, using a set of scaled\nfilters. The shapes of the filters are based on the gaps that develop in\nsimulations of dark matter sub-halos crossing a star stream. The high Galactic\nlatitude 8.4 kpc long segment of GD-1 that we examine has 8+/-3 gaps of 99%\nsignificance or greater, with the error estimated on the basis of tests of the\ngap-filtering technique. The cumulative distribution of gaps more than 3 times\nthe width of the stream is in good agreement with predictions for dark matter\nsub-halo encounters with cold star streams. The number of gaps narrower than 3\ntimes the width of the GD-1 stream falls well below the cold stream prediction\nwhich is taken into account for the gap creation rate integrated over all\nsizes.

The Turbulent Core\nAccretion model invokes such cores as being in approximate virial equilibrium\nand in approximate pressure equilibrium with their surrounding clump medium.\nTheir internal pressure is provided by a combination of turbulence and magnetic\nfields. Alternatively, the Competitive Accretion model requires strongly\nsub-virial initial conditions that then lead to extensive fragmentation to the\nthermal Jeans scale, with intermediate- and high-mass stars later forming by\ncompetitive Bondi-Hoyle accretion.

A convex cut of a graph $G=(V, E)$ is a\n$2$-partition $V_1 \\dot{\\cup} V_2=V$ such that both $V_1$ and $V_2$ are convex,\n\\ie shortest paths between vertices in $V_i$ never leave $V_i$, $i \\in \\{1,\n2\\}$. Finding convex cuts is $\\mathcal{NP}$-hard for general graphs. To\ncharacterize convex cuts, we employ the Djokovic relation, a reflexive and\nsymmetric relation on the edges of a graph that is based on shortest paths\nbetween the edges' end vertices.\n  It is known for a long time that, if $G$ is bipartite and the Djokovic\nrelation is transitive on $G$, \\ie $G$ is a partial cube, then the cut-sets of\n$G$'s convex cuts are precisely the equivalence classes of the Djokovic\nrelation. In particular, any edge of $G$ is contained in the cut-set of exactly\none convex cut. We first characterize a class of plane graphs that we call {\\em\nwell-arranged}. These graphs are not necessarily partial cubes, but any edge of\na well-arranged graph is contained in the cut-set(s) of at least one convex\ncut. We also present an algorithm that uses the Djokovic relation for computing\nall convex cuts of a (not necessarily plane) bipartite graph in $\\bigO(|E|^3)$\ntime. Specifically, a cut-set is the cut-set of a convex cut if and only if the\nDjokovic relation holds for any pair of edges in the cut-set.\n  We then characterize the cut-sets of the convex cuts of a general graph $H$\nusing two binary relations on edges: (i) the Djokovic relation on the edges of\na subdivision of $H$, where any edge of $H$ is subdivided into exactly two\nedges and (ii) a relation on the edges of $H$ itself that is not the Djokovic\nrelation. Finally, we use this characterization to present the first algorithm\nfor finding all convex cuts of a plane graph in polynomial time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Mar 2013 18:21:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 Mar 2013 10:15:17 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 16 Jan 2014 11:14:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-17"}

The 1st of these encompasses the main sequence\n(MS) of SFGs, the 2nd one a rarer population of starbursts (SB). We show that\nthe sSFR-distribution of SBs can be regarded as the result of a physical\nprocess (plausibly merging) taking the mathematical form of a log-normal\nboosting kernel and enhancing star formation activity. We explore the utility\nof splitting the star-forming population into MS and SB galaxies - an approach\nwe term \"2-Star Formation Mode\" (2-SFM) framework - for understanding their\nmolecular gas properties. Variations of star formation efficiency (SFE) and gas\nfractions among SFGs take a simple, redshift-independent form, once these\nquantities are normalized to the value of an average MS galaxy. The change in\nSFE for galaxies undergoing a starburst event scales supra-linearly with the\nSFR-increase, as expected for mergers. This implies a continuous distribution\nof galaxies in the Schmidt-Kennicutt plane that separates more clearly into\nloci for SBs and normal galaxies than observed in SFR vs. M* space. SBs with\nthe largest deviations (>10-fold) from the MS, like many local ULIRGs, are not\naverage SBs, but even rarer events with progenitors having larger gas fractions\nthan typical MS galaxies. We statistically infer that the gas fractions of\ntypical SBs decrease by a factor of 2 to 3 with respect to their direct MS\nprogenitors, as expected to occur in short-term SFR-boosts during which\ninternal gas reservoirs are drained more quickly than gas is accreted from the\ncosmic web. We predict variations of the CO-to-H2 conversion factor in the\nSFR-M* plane and provide evidence that the higher sSFR of distant galaxies is a\ndirect consequence of larger gas fraction in these systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Mar 2013 20:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 11 Sep 2014 13:27:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

(2) The\nmicrocontroller-based SCB reads the motor axis tachometers and implements the\nvelocity loop by sending torque commands to the motor amplifiers at 558 Hz. (3)\nThe motor amplifiers implement the torque loop by monitoring and sending\ncurrent to the three-phase brushless drive motors at 20 kHz. The velocity loop\nuses a traditional proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control algorithm,\nwhile the position loop uses only a proportional term and implements a command\nshaper based on the Gauss error function.

In each antenna, a Palm Vx\nhand controller displays system status and allows full local control of the\ndrives in an intuitive touchscreen user interface.

In this study we analyze the publicly\navailable Data Repository of Yeast Genetic INteractions (DRYGIN), which\ncontains the growth rates of over five million double gene knockout mutants.

Light stops may induce sizable\nmodifications of the Higgs gluon fusion production rate and correlated\nmodifications to the Higgs diphoton decay. Departures from SM values of the\nbottom-quark and tau-lepton couplings to the Higgs can be obtained due to Higgs\nmixing effects triggered by light third generation scalar superpartners. We\ndescribe the phenomenological implications of light staus on searches for light\nstops and non-standard Higgs bosons.

Recent theoretical investigations have\ndemonstrated their superiority over the convex counterparts in several sparse\nlearning settings. However, solving the non-convex optimization problems\nassociated with non-convex penalties remains a big challenge. A commonly used\napproach is the Multi-Stage (MS) convex relaxation (or DC programming), which\nrelaxes the original non-convex problem to a sequence of convex problems. This\napproach is usually not very practical for large-scale problems because its\ncomputational cost is a multiple of solving a single convex problem.

This work presents the\nfirst technique for decomposing an imperfect information game into subgames\nthat can be solved independently, while retaining optimality guarantees on the\nfull-game solution. We can use this technique to construct theoretically\njustified algorithms that make better use of information available at run-time,\novercome memory or disk limitations at run-time, or make a time/space trade-off\nto overcome memory or disk limitations while solving a game.

Current attitudes towards the use of automation\nin digital forensic investigations are examined, as well as the issue of\ndigital investigators knowledge acquisition and retention. The argument is made\nfor a well planned, careful use of automation going forward that allows for a\nmore efficient and effective use of automation in digital forensic\ninvestigations while at the same time attempting to improve the overall quality\nof expert investigators.

Simulated carrier mobility demonstrates a usual Poole-Frenkel field\ndependence and its slope is very close to the experimental value without using\nany adjustable parameter. At room temperature transients are universal with\nrespect to the electric field and transport layer thickness. At the same time,\ncarrier mobility does not depend on the layer thickness and transients develop\na well-defined plateau where the current does not depend on time, thus\ndemonstrating a non-dispersive transport regime. Tails of the transients decay\nas power law with the exponent close to -2.

Allowing for melting/freezing at one or both of the boundaries of the\nsolid layer is likely to affect the pattern of convection in the layer. We\nstudy here the onset of thermal convection in a viscous spherical shell with\ndynamically induced melting/freezing at either or both of its boundaries. It is\nshown that the behavior of each interface depends on the value of a dimensional\nnumber P, which is the ratio of a melting/freezing timescale over a viscous\nrelaxation timescale. A small value of P corresponds to permeable boundary\nconditions, while a large value of P corresponds to impermeable boundary\nconditions. The linear stability analysis predicts a significant effect of\nsemi-permeable boundaries when the number P characterizing either of the\nboundary is small enough: allowing for melting/freezing at either of the\nboundary results in the emergence of larger scale convective modes. The effect\nis particularly drastic when the outer boundary is permeable, since the degree\n1 mode remains the most unstable even in the case of thin spherical shells. In\nthe case of a spherical shell with permeable inner and outer boundaries, the\nmost unstable mode consists in a global translation of the solid shell, with no\ndeformation. In the limit of a full sphere with permeable outer boundary, this\ncorresponds to the \"convective translation\" mode recently proposed for Earth's\ninner core. As an example of possible application, we discuss the case of\nthermal convection in Enceladus' ice shell assuming the presence of a global\nsubsurface ocean, and found that melting/freezing could have an important\neffect on the pattern of convection in the ice shell.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Mar 2013 08:48:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-20"}

We show that in the presence of spatial\ncurvature K or a positive cosmological constant, the density perturbation\napproaches a finite limit both to first and second order, but the rate of\napproach depends on the model, being power law in the scale factor if the\ncosmological constant is positive but logarithmic if it is zero and and K<0.\nScalar perturbations in general contain a growing and a decaying mode. We find,\nsomewhat surprisingly, that if the cosmological constant is positive the\ndecaying mode does not die away, i.e. it contributes on an equal footing as the\ngrowing mode to the asymptotic expression for the density perturbation. On the\nother hand, the future asymptotic regime of the Einstein-de Sitter universe\n(for which the cosmological constant and the spatial curvature are both zero)\nis completely different, as exemplified by the density perturbation which\ndiverges; moreover, the second order perturbation diverges faster than the\nfirst order perturbation, which suggests that the Einstein-de Sitter universe\nis unstable to perturbations, and that the perturbation series do not converge\ntowards the future. We conclude that the presence of spatial curvature or a\ncosmological constant stabilizes the perturbations. Our second goal is to\nderive an explicit expression for the second order density perturbation that\ncan be used to study the effects of including a cosmological constant and\nspatial curvature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Mar 2013 09:10:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-28"}

This is the case as long as the system size is smaller than the\nsimulation box side, so that its interaction with the infinite copies can be\nneglected. In such a situation, the over-density rapidly undergoes to a global\ncollapse forming a quasi stationary state in virial equilibrium. However, by\nevolving the system with a cosmological code (GADGET) for a sufficiently long\ntime, a clear deviation from such quasi-equilibrium configuration is observed.\nThis occurs in a time t_{LI} that depends on the values of the simulation\nnumerical parameters such as the softening length and thetime-stepping\naccuracy, i.e. it is a numerical artifact related to the limited spatial and\ntemporal resolutions. The analysis of the Layzer-Irvine cosmic energy equation,\nconfirms that this deviation corresponds to an unphysical dynamical regime. By\nvarying the numerical parameters of the simulation and the physical parameters\nof the system we show that the unphysical behaviour originates from badly\nintegrated close scatterings of high velocity particles.

We give three logic-to-automata translations which\ncan be used to give upper bounds for FO2 and UTL and various sublogics. We\napply these to get new bounds for both non-deterministic systems (hierarchical\nand recursive state machines, games) and for probabilistic systems (Markov\nchains, recursive Markov chains, and Markov decision processes). We couple\nthese with matching lower-bound arguments. Next, we look at combining FO2\nverification techniques with those for LTL. We present here a language that\nsubsumes both FO2 and LTL, and inherits the model checking properties of both\nlanguages.

Based on\nour observations, we determined 14 mid-transit times. Together with published\nTc we found that the timing residuals showed no significant deviation from the\nlinear ephemeris. We concluded that a periodic TTV signal with an amplitude\ngreater than 1 minute over a 4-year time span seems to be unlikely. Our\nanalysis of an upper mass limit allows us to exclude an additional Earth-mass\nplanet close to inner 3:1, 2:1, and 5:3 and outer 3:5, 1:2, and 1:3 mean-motion\nresonances. Using the long-term integration and applying the method of maximum\neccentricity, the region from 0.015 au to 0.05 au was found unstable and the\nregion beyond the 0.05 au was found to have a chaotic behaviour and its\ndepletion increases with increasing values of the initial eccentricity as well\nas inclination.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Mar 2013 10:16:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

It can be used to solve the laminar\nor turbulent incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. Up to now its scalability\nwas strongly limited by a rather rigid communication infrastructure, which led\nto a dominance of MPI time already at small process counts.\n  This paper describes several optimizations to increase the performance,\nscalability, and flexibility of FASTEST-3D. First, a node-level performance\nanalysis is carried out in order to pinpoint the main bottlenecks and identify\nsweet spots for energy-efficient execution. In addition, a single-precision\nversion of the solver for the linear equation system arising from the\ndiscretization of the governing equations is devised, which significantly\nincreases the single-core performance. Then the communication mechanisms in\nFASTEST-3D are analyzed and a new communication strategy based on non-blocking\ncalls is implemented. Performance results with the revised version show\nsignificantly increased single-node performance and considerably improved\ncommunication patterns along with much better parallel scalability. In this\ncontext we discuss the concept of \"acceptable parallel efficiency\" and how it\ninfluences the real gain of the optimizations. Scaling measurements are carried\nout on a modern petascale system. The obtained improvements are of major\nimportance for the use of FASTEST-3D on current high-performance computer\nclusters and will help to perform simulations with much higher spatial and\ntemporal resolution to tackle turbulent flow in technical applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Mar 2013 10:18:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-20"}

We find that combining cluster data with CMB measurements from Planck\nimproves by more than an order of magnitude the constraint on neutrino masses\ncompared to each probe used independently.

This accuracy would be sufficient for a 2 sigma detection of neutrino\nmass even in the minimal normal hierarchy scenario.

Realistic\napplications of the quartet formalism are carried out for the Sn isotopes with\nthe valence neutrons in the 50-82 neutron shell. Exact ground state correlation\nenergies, occupation numbers and pair transfer matrix elements are reproduced\nto a very high degree of precision. The formalism also lends itself to a\nstraightforward and accurate description of the lowest seniority 0 and 2\nexcited states of the pairing Hamiltonian. A simplified representation of the\nground state as a product of identical quartets is eventually discussed and\nfound to improve considerably upon the more traditional particle-number\nprojected-BCS approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Mar 2013 11:21:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

In addition, the unidirectional\nlaminates may not be available for testing. In such cases, full-field\ndisplacement measurements offer the potential of identifying several material\nproperties simultaneously. For that, it is desirable to create complex\ndisplacement fields that are strongly influenced by all the elastic constants.\nIn this work, we explore the potential of using a laminated plate with an\nopen-hole under traction loading to achieve that and identify all four ply\nelastic constants (E 1, E 2, 12, G 12) at once. However, the accuracy of the\nidentified properties may not be as good as properties measured from individual\ntests due to the complexity of the experiment, the relative insensitivity of\nthe measured quantities to some of the properties and the various possible\nsources of uncertainty. It is thus important to quantify the uncertainty (or\nconfidence) with which these properties are identified. Here, Bayesian\nidentification is used for this purpose, because it can readily model all the\nuncertainties in the analysis and measurements, and because it provides the\nfull coupled probability distribution of the identified material properties. In\naddition, it offers the potential to combine properties identified based on\nsubstantially different experiments. The full-field measurement is obtained by\nmoir\\'e interferometry. For computational efficiency the Bayesian approach was\napplied to a proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) of the displacement fields.\nThe analysis showed that the four orthotropic elastic constants are determined\nwith quite different confidence levels as well as with significant correlation.\nComparison with manufacturing specifications showed substantial difference in\none constant, and this conclusion agreed with earlier measurement of that\nconstant by a traditional four-point bending test. It is possible that the POD\napproach did not take full advantage of the copious data provided by the full\nfield measurements, and for that reason that data is provided for others to use\n(as on line material attached to the article).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Mar 2013 14:19:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-20"}

The use\nof gradient-based optimization methods in the AF computational schemes yields\nto a set of the filter sensitivity equations and a set of matrix Riccati-type\nsensitivity equations. The filter sensitivities evaluation is usually done by\nthe conventional KF, which is known to be numerically unstable, and its\nderivatives with respect to unknown system parameters.

It has long been appreciated that higher densities are achieved by\nusing collections of particles with a variety of sizes. The variety of sizes is\noften quantified by the polydispersity of the particle size distribution: the\nstandard deviation of the radius divided by the mean radius. Several prior\nstudies quantified the increase of the packing density as a function of\npolydispersity. Of course, a particle size distribution is also characterized\nby its skewness, kurtosis, and higher moments, but the influence of these\nparameters has not been carefully quantified before. In this work, we\nnumerically generate many packings with different particle radii distributions,\nvarying polydispersity and skewness independently of one another. We find two\nsignificant results. First, the skewness can have a significant effect on the\npacking density and in some cases can have a larger effect than polydispersity.\nSecond, the packing fraction is relatively insensitive to the value of the\nkurtosis. We present a simple empirical formula for the value of the random\nclose packing density as a function of polydispersity and skewness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Mar 2013 14:54:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 21 Jun 2013 15:39:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-13"}

The small-to-large crossover lengthscale\nof hydrophobic hydration depends on the thermodynamic conditions of the solvent\nsuch as temperature, pressure, presence of additives, etc... We attempt to shed\nsome light on the temperature dependence of the crossover lengthscale by using\na probabilistic approach to water hydrogen bonding that allows one to obtain an\nanalytic expression for the number of bonds per water molecule as a function of\nboth its distance to a solute and solute radius. Incorporating that approach\ninto the density functional theory, one can examine the solute size effects on\nits hydration over the entire small-to-large lengthscale range at different\ntemperatures. Knowing the dependence of the hydration free energy on\ntemperature and solute size, one can obtain its enthalpic and entropic\ncontributions as functions of temperature and solute size. These function can\nprovide interesting insight into the temperature dependence of the crossover\nlengthscale of hydrophobic hydration. The model was applied to the hydration of\nspherical particles of various radii in water in the temperature range from\nT=293.15 K to T=333.15 K. The model predictions for the temperature dependence\nof the hydration free energy of small hydrophobes are consistent with the\nexperimental and simulational data. Three alternative definitions for the\nsmall-to-large crossover length-scale of hydrophobic hydration are proposed,\nand their temperature dependence is obtained. Depending on the definition and\ntemperature, the small-to-large crossover in the hydration mechanism is\npredicted to occur for hydrophobes of radii from one to several nanometers.\nIndependent of its definition, the crossover length-scale is predicted to\ndecrease with increasing temperature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Mar 2013 15:32:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 29 Jul 2013 17:31:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

The stellar\nmaterial has a final state resembling a football, that is a significant part of\nit is concentrated in a thin surface shell. An interior pressure is exerted by\nthe strong gravitational field, equivalent to a negative mass. However, the OS\nsolution has been misunderstood, the shell's position being incorrectly\nidentified with the \"event horizon\" in black-hole theory. While half the\nmaterial is concentrated in a shell occupying a small fraction of the radius,\nsome material is spread throughout the interior, unlike the concentration in a\nblack hole's singularity. We deal with the singularity in density at the shell\nsurface, by including Fermi pressure of degenerate electrons for a shell\ndensity comparable to a solar mass-sized white dwarf. Because the high-density\nregion is concentrated in a shell, instead of at the centre as in a black hole,\nour conclusion is that repulsive gravity enables the existence of supermassive\nwhite dwarfs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Mar 2013 18:24:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 Sep 2013 15:34:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-27"}
