The heterogeneous cellular network is modeled as the\nsuperposition of many tiers of Base Stations (BSs) having different transmit\npower, density, path-loss exponent, fading parameters and distribution, and\nunequal biasing for flexible tier association. A long-term averaged maximum\nbiased-received-power tier association is considered. The positions of the BSs\nin each tier are modeled as points of an independent Poisson Point Process\n(PPP). Under these assumptions, we introduce a new analytical methodology to\nevaluate the average rate, which avoids the computation of the Coverage\nProbability (Pcov) and needs only the Moment Generating Function (MGF) of the\naggregate interference at the probe mobile terminal. The distinguishable\ncharacteristic of our analytical methodology consists in providing a tractable\nand numerically efficient framework that is applicable to general fading\ndistributions, including composite fading channels with small- and mid-scale\nfluctuations. In addition, our method can efficiently handle correlated\nLog-Normal shadowing with little increase of the computational complexity.

When the projectile and the target have different\n$N/Z$ ratios, fast transfer processes of a few nucleons towards the charge\nequilibrium of the initial system occur in reactions at large impact\nparameters. As the impact parameter decreases, a neck formation is responsible\nfor the transfer. A number of nucleons are transferred by the neck breaking\nwhen two nuclei dissociate, leading to transfers of protons and neutrons in the\nsame direction. Comparing cross sections by theory and measurements, we find\nthe TDHF theory describes the transfer cross sections of a few nucleons\nreasonably. As the number of transferred nucleons increases, the agreement\nbecomes less accurate. The TDHF calculation overestimates transfer cross\nsections accompanying a large number of neutrons when more than one proton are\ntransferred.

In the new approaches stable population size is a dynamic\nequilibrium between different mortality and fecundity factors instead of an\narbitrary fixed carrying capacity. The latest replicator dynamics models assume\nthat regulation of the population size acts through feedback driven by density\ndependent juvenile mortality. Here, we consider a simplified model to extract\nthe properties of this approach. We show that at the stable population size,\nthe structure of the frequency dependent evolutionary game emerges. Turnover of\nindividuals induces a lottery mechanism where for each nest site released by a\ndead adult individual a single newborn is drawn from the pool of newborn\ncandidates. This frequency dependent selection leads toward the strategy\nmaximizing the number of newborns per adult death. However, multiple strategies\ncan maximize this value. Among them, the strategy with the greatest mortality\n(which implies greater instantaneous growth rate) is selected. This result is\nimportant for the discussion about universal fitness measures and which\nparameters are maximized by natural selection. This is related to the fitness\nmeasures R0 and r, because the number of newborns per single dead individual\nequals lifetime production of newborn R0 in models without ageing.

Under this scheduling framework, the\nindividual sum rate, namely the average rate for a given user multiplied by the\nnumber of users, is of interest and analyzed under different feedback schemes.\nFirstly, under the full feedback scheme, we derive the closed form individual\nsum rate by employing a decomposition of the probability density function of\nthe selected user's signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio. This technique is\nemployed to further obtain a closed form rate approximation with selective\nfeedback in the spatial dimension. The analysis is also extended to random\nbeamforming in a wideband OFDMA system with additional selective feedback in\nthe spectral dimension wherein only the best beams for the best-L resource\nblocks are fed back. We utilize extreme value theory to examine the randomness\nof multiuser diversity incurred by selective feedback. Finally, by leveraging\nthe tail equivalence method, the multiplicative effect of selective feedback\nand random observations is observed to establish the individual rate scaling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Mar 2013 02:55:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

Our main result is that these strong randomness\nassumptions can be removed, obtaining the same space--time tradeoffs in the\nworst case. We also show that for small space usage the dissection algorithm\ncan be almost fully parallelized. Our strategy for dealing with arbitrary\ninstances is to instead inject the randomness into the dissection process\nitself by working over a carefully selected but random composite modulus, and\nto introduce explicit space--time controls into the algorithm by means of a\n\"bailout mechanism\".\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Mar 2013 05:53:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-05"}

We propose the following combination-based approach.\nCandidate expansion terms are first obtained using a distribution based method.\nThis set is then refined based on the strength of the association of terms with\nthe original query terms. We test our methods on 11 TREC collections. The\nproposed combinations generally yield better results than each individual\nmethod, as well as other state-of-the-art AQE approaches. En route to our\nprimary goal, we also propose some modifications to LCA and Bo1 which lead to\nimproved performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Mar 2013 10:34:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-05"}

For instance, q-state Potts models in two dimensions\ndisplay a second order, continuous transition for q = 2,3,4 and first order for\nhigher q.\n  Tamura et al recently introduced Potts models with \"invisible\" states which\ncontribute to the entropy but not the internal energy and noted that adding\nsuch invisible states could transmute continuous transitions into first order\ntransitions. This was observed both in a Bragg-Williams type mean-field\ncalculation and 2D Monte-Carlo simulations. It was suggested that the invisible\nstate mechanism for transmuting the order of a transition might play a role\nwhere transition orders inconsistent with the usual scheme had been observed.\n  In this paper we note that an alternative mean-field approach employing\n3-regular random (\"thin\") graphs also displays this change in the order of the\ntransition as the number of invisible states is varied, although the number of\nstates required to effect the transmutation, 17 invisible states when there are\n2 visible states, is much higher than in the Bragg-Williams case. The\ncalculation proceeds by using the equivalence of the Potts model with 2 visible\nand r invisible states to the Blume-Emery-Griffiths (BEG) model, so a\nby-product is the solution of the BEG model on thin random graphs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Mar 2013 11:34:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Apr 2013 10:33:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-18"}

It is found that the minimum mass ratio of W UMa binaries decreases\nwith increasing mass of the primary if the primary's mass is less than about\n1.3$M_{\\rm \\odot}$, and above this mass the ratio is roughly constant. By\ncomparing the theoretical minimum mass ratio with the observational data, it is\nfound that the existence of low-$q$ systems can be explained by the different\nstructure of the primaries with different masses. This suggests that the\ndimensionless gyration radius ($k_1^2$) and thus the structure of the primary\nis very important in determining the minimum mass ratio. In addition, we\ninvestigate the mass loss during the merging process of W UMa systems and\ncalculate the rotation velocities of the single stars formed by the merger of W\nUMa binaries due to tidal instability. It is found that in the case of the\nconservation of mass and angular momentum, the merged single stars rotate with\na equatorial velocity of about $588\\sim819$ km s$^{-1}$, which is much larger\nthan their break-up velocities ($v_{\\rm b}$). This suggests that the merged\nstars should extend to a very large radius (3.7$\\sim$5.3 times the radii of the\nprimaries) or W UMa systems would lose a large amount of mass (21$\\sim$33 per\ncent of the total mass) during the merging process. If the effect of magnetic\nbraking is considered, the mass loss decreases to be 12$\\sim$18 per cent of\ntheir total masses. This implies that the significant angular momentum and mass\nmight be lost from W UMa systems in the course of the merging process, and this\nkind of mass and angular momentum loss might be driven by the release of\norbital energy of the secondaries, which is similar to common-envelope\nevolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Mar 2013 11:51:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-05"}

The same symmetry is present for electromagnetism\nin a homogeneous, dispersive medium, allowing the derivation of the zilch\ndensity and flux in such a medium. Optical helicity density and flux are also\nderived for a homogeneous, dispersive medium. For monochromatic beams in\nvacuum, optical zilch is proportional to optical helicity. This monochromatic\nzilch-helicity relation acquires a factor of the square of the phase index in a\ndispersive medium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Mar 2013 12:49:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Apr 2013 10:14:38 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 30 Apr 2013 16:18:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

Next, we address the problem of\nestimating the unknown value of the bound, which leads to a unique twist on the\nclassical problem of non-parametric density estimation. In particular, we\ndevelop an estimator for the bound and show that its MSE matches optimal\nnon-parametric rates under certain conditions. (Concurrent with this work, some\nclosely related results have also been considered in Cannings and Samworth\n(2017) and Lopes (2019).)\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Mar 2013 15:16:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 3 Jun 2016 10:34:41 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 30 Apr 2019 08:23:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-01"}

A similar\nsituation was found on two archaeological sites: in Bezymennoye II settlement\nSouth sanctuary and in Pustynka settlement religious building. Drawing on\nethnographic and folklore data, it is concluded about semiotic connection of\nstone tools, found in these religious constructions, with the \"thunderstones\"\nand meteorites.ut semiotic connection of stone tools, found in these religious\nconstructions, with the \"thunderstones\" and meteorites.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Mar 2013 06:18:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Mar 2013 17:06:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 26 Mar 2013 12:00:25 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 27 Aug 2015 04:23:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-28"}

We use two sets of initial\nconditions. In the first set (dynamics 1) the system's center of mass is at\nrest. In the second set (dynamics 2) the center of mass evolves with velocity\nV. If dynamics 1 is observed from a reference frame moving with velocity -V,\nthe principle of relativity requires that all observables must be identical to\nthose of dynamics 2 seen from the lab frame. Our numerical simulations\ndemonstrate that kinematic Lorentz space-time transformations fail to transform\nparticle observables between the two frames. This is explained as a result of\nthe inevitable interaction-dependence of the boost generator in the instant\nform of relativistic dynamics. In spite of general inaccuracies of Lorentz\nformulas, the orbital periods are correctly predicted by the Einstein's time\ndilation factor for all interaction strengths.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Mar 2013 00:40:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}
