We compare the observational results with different\nchemical models to explore the relative importance of gas-phase, grain-surface\nand time-dependent chemistry in these environments. The emission of the small\nhydrocarbons show different patterns. The CCH emission is extended while CH and\nc-C$_3$H$_2$ are concentrated towards the more illuminated layers of the PDR.\nThe ratio of the column densities of c-C$_3$H$_2$ and CCH shows spatial\nvariations up to a factor of a few, increasing from\n$N(c-C$_3$H$_2$)/N(CCH)\\approx0.004$ in the envelope to a maximum of\n$\\sim0.015-0.029$ towards the 8$\\mu$m emission peak.

We follow individual GMCs (defined in our simulations by a total\ncolumn density criterion), including their level of star formation, from their\nformation to dispersal. We find the evolution of GMCs is highly complex. GMCs\noften form from a combination of smaller clouds and ambient ISM, and similarly\ndisperse by splitting into a number of smaller clouds and ambient ISM. However\nsome clouds emerge as the result of the disruption of a more massive GMC,\nrather than from the assembly of smaller clouds. Likewise in some cases, clouds\naccrete onto more massive clouds rather than disperse. Because of the\ndifficulty of determining a precursor or successor of a given GMC, determining\nGMC histories and lifetimes is highly non-trivial. Using a definition relating\nto the continuous evolution of a cloud, we obtain lifetimes typically of 4-25\nMyr for >10^5 M$_{\\odot}$ GMCs, over which time the star formation efficiency\nis about 1 %. We also relate the lifetime of GMCs to their crossing time. We\nfind that the crossing time is a reasonable measure of the actual lifetime of\nthe cloud, although there is considerable scatter.

We utilize deep MIPS imaging and a mass-limited sample of 85\nspectroscopic members to identify 16 24um-bright sources within the cluster,\nand measure their 24um star formation rates (SFRs) down to ~6 Msolar/year.\nBased on their line-of-sight velocities and stellar ages, MIPS cluster members\nappear to be an infalling population that was recently accreted from the field\nwith minimal environmental dependency on their star formation.

Alternatively, selection acting on new\nmutations, and affecting linked neutral sites, could reduce variability on the\nY chromosome. Here, using genome-wide analyses of X, Y, autosomal and\nmitochondrial DNA, in combination with extensive population genetic\nsimulations, we show that low observed Y chromosome variability is not\nconsistent with a purely neutral model. Instead, we show that models of\npurifying selection are consistent with observed Y diversity. Further, the\nnumber of sites estimated to be under purifying selection greatly exceeds the\nnumber of Y-linked coding sites, suggesting the importance of the highly\nrepetitive ampliconic regions. While we show that purifying selection removing\ndeleterious mutations can explain the low diversity on the Y chromosome, we\ncannot exclude the possibility that positive selection acting on beneficial\nmutations could have also reduced diversity in linked neutral regions, and may\nhave contributed to lowering human Y chromosome diversity. Because the\nfunctional significance of the ampliconic regions is poorly understood, our\nfindings should motivate future research in this area.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Mar 2013 18:22:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Dec 2013 21:30:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-19"}

The magnetic\ntrack has been a model system to study magnetic and magneto-electronic\nphenomena, such as field induced DW propagation and spin-transfer torque. This\nthesis focuses on DW manipulation and DW-based devices in spin-valve (SV)\ntracks. In comparison to monolayer tracks, the SV track enables more sensitive\nand versatile measurements, as well as an electronic output of DW-based\ndevices, of crucial interest to applications. However, these multi-layered\ntracks add new, potentially disruptive magnetic interactions, as well as\nfabrication challenges. In this thesis, the DW propagation in SV tracks of\ndifferent compositions was studied, and a system with DW propagation properties\ncomparable to the state-of-the-art in monolayer tracks was demonstrated, down\nto an unprecedented lateral size of 33nm. Several logic devices were\ndemonstrated and studied, namely a turn-counting DW spiral, a DW gate, DW logic\nNOT gates, and a DW-DW interactor. It was found that the magnetic behaviour of\nthese devices was analogous to that of monolayer structures, and the device\nperformance, as defined by the range of field wherein they function desirably,\nwas found to be comparable to that of monolayer systems. The interaction\nbetween DWs in adjacent tracks was studied and new phenomena were\ncharacterised, such as DW depinning induced by a static or travelling adjacent\nDW. The contribution of different mechanisms to electrical current induced\ndepinning were quantified, and it was found that the Oersted field, negligible\nin monolayer tracks, was responsible for large variations in depinning field in\nSV tracks, and that the strength of spin-transfer effect was similar to that\nreported in monolayer tracks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Mar 2013 18:32:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-21"}

Recent development of a new Monte Carlo code ChaS made\npossible a detailed simulation of particle channeling and radiation emission in\nperiodically bent crystals. According to recent findings, energy of the\nelectron beam below 1 GeV is sufficient to observe the undulator effect in a\nperiodically bent crystal. Even more exciting results were obtained for a\ncrystalline undulator whose bending period is shorter than the period of the\nchanneling oscillations and the bending amplitude is smaller than the width of\nthe planar channel. Such a crystalline undulator is far superior to what was\nproposed previously. It allows for a large effective number of undulator\nperiods. Therefore, it is predicted to emit intense undulator radiation in the\nforward direction. A narrow undulator peak is seen for both positron and\nelectron beams. Using positrons is, however, more desirable because in this\ncase the intensity of the undulator radiation is higher while the background is\nlower.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Mar 2013 19:20:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-13"}

This method allows to include local gauge invariance as a fundamental\nsymmetry of the atomic Hamiltonian, arising from natural atomic interactions\nand conservation laws (and not as a property of a low energy sector). This\nallows us to implement elementary gauge invariant interactions for three\nlattice gauge theories: compact QED (U(1)), SU(N) and Z_N, which can be used to\nbuild quantum simulators in 1+1 dimensions.

This unexpected behavior can be understood as arising due to\na common path interference between two distinct tunneling solutions. The\nphenomenon is insensitive to magnetic field, and arises whenever the low energy\ndispersion relation contains higher order terms in addition to the usual $p^2$\nterm. Such higher order terms are generically present, albeit with small\nco-efficient, so that the oscillatory Zener tunneling is a universal\nphenomenon. However, the first `Zener oscillation' occurs at a transmission\nprobability which is exponentially small when the co-efficient of the higher\norder terms is small. This explains why this oscillatory aspect of Zener\ntunneling has been hitherto overlooked, despite its universality. The common\npath interference is also destroyed by the presence of odd powers of $p$ in the\nlow energy dispersion relation. Since odd powers of $p$ are strictly absent\nonly when the tunneling barrier lies along an axis of mirror symmetry, it\nfollows that the robustness of the oscillatory behavior depends on the\norientation of the tunneling barrier. Bilayer graphene is identified as a\nparticularly good material for observation of common path interference, due to\nits unusual nearly isotropic dispersion relation, where the $p^4$ term makes\nthe leading contribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Mar 2013 20:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-13"}

If\nthe SFR efficiency and wind mass loading are constant, the sSFR is set to the\nspecific accretion rate of the galaxy: more realistic situations lead to an\nsSFR which is perturbed from this identity. The metallicity is set by the\ninstantaneous operation of the regulator system rather than by the past history\nof the system. The regulator system naturally produces a Z(mstar, SFR)\nrelation, with SFR as a second parameter in the mass-metallicity relation.

Scientific results include robust\nsupport for the standard six-parameter LCDM model of cosmology and improved\nmeasurements of its parameters, including a highly significant deviation from\nscale invariance of the primordial power spectrum. The Planck values for these\nparameters and others derived from them are significantly different from those\npreviously determined. Several large-scale anomalies in the temperature\ndistribution of the CMB, first detected by WMAP, are confirmed with higher\nconfidence. Planck sets new limits on the number and mass of neutrinos, and has\nmeasured gravitational lensing of CMB anisotropies at greater than 25 sigma.\nPlanck finds no evidence for non-Gaussianity in the CMB. Planck's results agree\nwell with results from the measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations. Planck\nfinds a lower Hubble constant than found in some more local measures. Some\ntension is also present between the amplitude of matter fluctuations derived\nfrom CMB data and that derived from SZ data.

Knowledge of the beam profiles is necessary for determining\nthe transfer function to go from the observed to the actual sky anisotropy\npower spectrum. The main beam distortions affect the beam window function,\ncomplicating the reconstruction of the anisotropy power spectrum at high\nmultipoles, whereas the sidelobes affect the low and intermediate multipoles.\nThe in-flight assessment of the LFI main beams relies on the measurements\nperformed during Jupiter observations. By stacking the data from multiple\nJupiter transits, the main beam profiles are measured down to -20 dB at 30 and\n44 GHz, and down to -25 dB at 70 GHz. The main beam solid angles are determined\nto better than 0.2% at each LFI frequency band. The Planck pre-launch optical\nmodel is conveniently tuned to characterize the main beams independently of any\nnoise effects. This approach provides an optical model whose beams fully\nreproduce the measurements in the main beam region, but also allows a\ndescription of the beams at power levels lower than can be achieved by the\nJupiter measurements themselves. The agreement between the simulated beams and\nthe measured beams is better than 1% at each LFI frequency band.

Our calibration is based on\na combination of the Orbital Dipole plus the Solar Dipole, caused respectively\nby the motion of the Planck spacecraft with respect to the Sun and by motion of\nthe Solar System with respect to the CMB rest frame. The latter provides a\nsignal of a few mK with the same spectrum as the CMB anisotropies and is\nvisible throughout the mission. In this data release we rely on the\ncharacterization of the Solar Dipole as measured by WMAP. We also present\npreliminary results (at 44GHz only) on the study of the Orbital Dipole, which\nagree with the WMAP value of the Solar System speed within our uncertainties.\nWe compute the calibration constant for each radiometer roughly once per hour,\nin order to keep track of changes in the detectors' gain. Since non-idealities\nin the optical response of the beams proved to be important, we implemented a\nfast convolution algorithm which considers the full beam response in estimating\nthe signal generated by the dipole. Moreover, in order to further reduce the\nimpact of residual systematics due to sidelobes, we estimated time variations\nin the calibration constant of the 30GHz radiometers (the ones with the largest\nsidelobes) using the signal of a reference load. We have estimated the\ncalibration accuracy in two ways: we have run a set of simulations to assess\nthe impact of statistical errors and systematic effects in the instrument and\nin the calibration procedure, and we have performed a number of consistency\nchecks on the data and on the brightness temperature of Jupiter. Calibration\nerrors for this data release are expected to be about 0.6% at 44 and 70 GHz,\nand 0.8% at 30 GHz.

The effective\nbeam is the angular response including the effect of the optics,detectors,data\nprocessing and the scan strategy. The window function is the representation of\nthis beam in the harmonic domain which is required to recover an unbiased\nmeasurement of the CMB angular power spectrum. The HFI is a scanning instrument\nand its effective beams are the convolution of: (a) the optical response of the\ntelescope and feeds;(b)the processing of the time-ordered data and\ndeconvolution of the bolometric and electronic time response; and (c) the\nmerging of several surveys to produce maps. The time response functions are\nmeasured using observations of Jupiter and Saturn and by minimizing survey\ndifference residuals. The scanning beam is the post-deconvolution angular\nresponse of the instrument, and is characterized with observations of Mars. The\nmain beam solid angles are determined to better than 0.5% at each HFI frequency\nband. Observations of Jupiter and Saturn limit near sidelobes (within 5deg) to\nabout 0.1% of the total solid angle. Time response residuals remain as long\ntails in the scanning beams, but contribute less than 0.1% of the total. The\nbias and uncertainty in the beam products are estimated using ensembles of\nsimulated planet observations that include the impact of instrumental noise and\nknown systematic effects.The correlation structure of these ensembles is\nwell-described by five error eigenmodes that are sub-dominant to sample\nvariance and instrumental noise in the harmonic domain. A suite of consistency\ntests provide confidence that the error model represents a sufficient\ndescription of the data. The total error in the effective beam window functions\nis below 1% at 100GHz up to ell~1500$,and below 0.5% at 143 and 217GHz up to\n~2000.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Mar 2013 20:10:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 15 Dec 2013 23:32:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

HFI observes the sky over a\nbroad range of frequencies, from 100 to 857 GHz. To get the best accuracy on\nthe calibration on such a large range, two different photometric calibration\nschemes have to be used. The 545 and 857 \\GHz\\ data are calibrated using Uranus\nand Neptune flux density measurements, compared with models of their\natmospheric emissions to calibrate the data. The lower frequencies (below 353\nGHz) are calibrated using the cosmological microwave background dipole.One of\nthe components of this anisotropy results from the orbital motion of the\nsatellite in the Solar System, and is therefore time-variable. Photometric\ncalibration is thus tightly linked to mapmaking, which also addresses low\nfrequency noise removal. The 2013 released HFI data show some evidence for\napparent gain variations of the HFI bolometers' detection chain. These\nvariations were identified by comparing observations taken more than one year\napart in the same configuration. We developed an effective correction to limit\nits effect on calibration, and assess its accuracy. We present several methods\nused to estimate the precision of the photometric calibration. We distinguish\nrelative (from one detector to another, or from one frequency to another) and\nabsolute uncertainties. In both cases, we found that these uncertainties range\nfrom a few $10^{-3}$ to several per cents from 100 to 857 GHz. We describe the\npipeline producing the maps from the HFI timelines, based on the photometric\ncalibration parameters and we detail the scheme used to a posteriori set the\nzero level of the maps. We also briefly discuss the cross-calibration between\nHFI and the SPIRE instrument on board Herschel. We finally summarize the basic\ncharacteristics of the set of the HFI maps from the 2013 Planck data release.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Mar 2013 20:10:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Jan 2014 13:02:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-29"}

The glitch shape for each family has been characterized\nempirically in flight data and removed from the detector time streams. The\nspectrum of the count rate/unit energy is computed for each family and a\ncorrespondence to where on the detector the particle hit is made. Most of the\ndetected glitches are from galactic protons incident on the Si die frame\nsupporting the micromachined bolometric detectors. At HFI, the particle flux is\n~ 5 per square cm and per second and is dominated by protons incident on the\nspacecraft with an energy >39 MeV, leading to a rate of typically one event per\nsecond and per detector. Different categories of glitches have different\nsignature in timestreams. Two of the glitch types have a low amplitude\ncomponent that decays over nearly 1 second. This component produces an excess\nnoise if not properly removed from the time ordered data. We have used a glitch\ndetection and subtraction method based on the joint fit of population\ntemplates.

Although a wealth of data exists in the Galactic plane and some\nwell-known molecular clouds, there is no available CO high sensitivity all-sky\nsurvey to date.\n  Such all-sky surveys can be constructed using the \\Planck\\ HFI data because\nthe three lowest CO rotational transition lines at 115, 230 and 345 GHz\nsignificantly contribute to the signal of the 100, 217 and 353 GHz HFI channels\nrespectively. Two different component separation methods are used to extract\nthe CO maps from Planck HFI data. The maps obtained are then compared to one\nanother and to existing external CO surveys. From these quality checks the best\nCO maps in terms of signal to noise and/or residual foreground contamination\nare selected. Three sets of velocity-integrated CO emission maps are produced:\nType 1 maps of the CO (1-0), (2-1), and (3-2) rotational transitions with low\nforeground contamination but moderate signal-to-noise ratio; Type 2 maps for\nthe (1-0) and (2-1) transitions with a better signal-to-noise ratio; and one\nType 3 map, a line composite map with the best signal-to-noise ratio in order\nto locate the faintest molecular regions. The maps are described in detail.\nThey are shown to be fully compatible with previous surveys of parts of the\nGalactic Plane and also of fainter regions out of the Galactic plane. The\nPlanck HFI velocity-integrated CO maps for the (1-0), (2-1), and (3-2)\nrotational transitions provide an unprecedented all-sky CO view of the Galaxy.\nThese maps are also of great interest to monitor potential CO contamination on\nCMB \\Planck\\ studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Mar 2013 20:10:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 25 Mar 2013 13:16:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-29"}

We use the Planck data to\ninvestigate the behaviour of zodiacal emission over the whole sky at\nsub-millimetre and millimetre wavelengths. We fit the Planck data to find the\nemissivities of the various components of the COBE zodiacal model -- a diffuse\ncloud, three asteroidal dust bands, a circumsolar ring, and an Earth-trailing\nfeature. The emissivity of the diffuse cloud decreases with increasing\nwavelength, as expected from earlier analyses. The emissivities of the dust\nbands, however, decrease less rapidly, indicating that the properties of the\ngrains in the bands are different from those in the diffuse cloud. We fit the\nsmall amount of Galactic emission seen through the telescope's far sidelobes,\nand place limits on possible contamination of the CMB results from both\nzodiacal and far-sidelobe emission. When necessary, the results are used in the\nPlanck pipeline to make maps with zodiacal emission and far sidelobes removed.\nWe show that the zodiacal correction to the CMB maps is small compared to the\nPlanck CMB temperature power spectrum and give a list of flux densities for\nsmall Solar System bodies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Mar 2013 20:10:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 Apr 2014 10:48:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-29"}

We use this\nlikelihood to derive the Planck CMB power spectrum over three decades in l,\ncovering 2 <= l <= 2500. The main source of error at l <= 1500 is cosmic\nvariance. Uncertainties in small-scale foreground modelling and instrumental\nnoise dominate the error budget at higher l's. For l < 50, our likelihood\nexploits all Planck frequency channels from 30 to 353 GHz through a physically\nmotivated Bayesian component separation technique. At l >= 50, we employ a\ncorrelated Gaussian likelihood approximation based on angular cross-spectra\nderived from the 100, 143 and 217 GHz channels. We validate our likelihood\nthrough an extensive suite of consistency tests, and assess the impact of\nresidual foreground and instrumental uncertainties on cosmological parameters.\nWe find good internal agreement among the high-l cross-spectra with residuals\nof a few uK^2 at l <= 1000. We compare our results with foreground-cleaned CMB\nmaps, and with cross-spectra derived from the 70 GHz Planck map, and find broad\nagreement in terms of spectrum residuals and cosmological parameters. The\nbest-fit LCDM cosmology is in excellent agreement with preliminary Planck\npolarisation spectra. The standard LCDM cosmology is well constrained by Planck\nby l <= 1500. For example, we report a 5.4 sigma deviation from n_s /= 1.\nConsidering various extensions beyond the standard model, we find no indication\nof significant departures from the LCDM framework.

The Planck spectra at high\nmultipoles are extremely well described by the standard spatially-flat\nsix-parameter LCDM cosmology. In this model Planck data determine the\ncosmological parameters to high precision. We find a low value of the Hubble\nconstant, H0=67.3+/-1.2 km/s/Mpc and a high value of the matter density\nparameter, Omega_m=0.315+/-0.017 (+/-1 sigma errors) in excellent agreement\nwith constraints from baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) surveys. Including\ncurvature, we find that the Universe is consistent with spatial flatness to\npercent-level precision using Planck CMB data alone. We present results from an\nanalysis of extensions to the standard cosmology, using astrophysical data sets\nin addition to Planck and high-resolution CMB data. None of these models are\nfavoured significantly over standard LCDM. The deviation of the scalar spectral\nindex from unity is insensitive to the addition of tensor modes and to changes\nin the matter content of the Universe. We find a 95% upper limit of r<0.11 on\nthe tensor-to-scalar ratio. There is no evidence for additional neutrino-like\nrelativistic particles. Using BAO and CMB data, we find N_eff=3.30+/-0.27 for\nthe effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom, and an upper limit of\n0.23 eV for the summed neutrino mass. Our results are in excellent agreement\nwith big bang nucleosynthesis and the standard value of N_eff=3.046. We find no\nevidence for dynamical dark energy. Despite the success of the standard LCDM\nmodel, this cosmology does not provide a good fit to the CMB power spectrum at\nlow multipoles, as noted previously by the WMAP team. While not of decisive\nsignificance, this is an anomaly in an otherwise self-consistent analysis of\nthe Planck temperature data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Mar 2013 20:10:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 Dec 2013 09:43:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 20 Mar 2014 13:12:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

The significance of\ndetection ranges from 2 to 4 sigma, depending on which method is used. We\ninvestigate three separate approaches, which cover essentially all previous\nstudies, as well as breaking new ground. (i) Correlation of the CMB with the\nPlanck reconstructed gravitational lensing potential (for the first time). This\ndetection is made using the lensing-induced bispectrum; the correlation between\nlensing and the ISW effect has a significance close to 2.5 sigma. (ii)\nCross-correlation with tracers of LSS, yielding around 3 sigma significance,\nbased on a combination of radio (NVSS) and optical (SDSS) data. (iii) Aperture\nphotometry on stacked CMB fields at the locations of known large-scale\nstructures, which yields a 4 sigma signal when using a previously explored\ncatalogue, but shows strong discrepancies in amplitude and scale compared to\nexpectations. More recent catalogues give more moderate results, ranging from\nnegligible to 2.5 sigma at most, but with a more consistent scale and\namplitude, the latter being still slightly above what is expected from\nnumerical simulations within LCMD. Where they can be compared, these\nmeasurements are compatible with previous work using data from WMAP, which had\nalready mapped these scales to the limits of cosmic variance. Planck's broader\nfrequency coverage confirms that the signal is achromatic, bolstering the case\nfor ISW detection. As a final step we use tracers of large-scale structure to\nfilter the CMB data, presenting maps of the ISW temperature perturbation. These\nresults provide complementary and independent evidence for the existence of a\ndark energy component that governs the current accelerated expansion of the\nUniverse.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Mar 2013 20:10:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 25 Nov 2013 17:28:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

The PSZ is selected through the signature of the\nSunyaev--Zeldovich (SZ) effect, and the sub-sample used here has a\nsignal-to-noise threshold of seven, with each object confirmed as a cluster and\nall but one with a redshift estimate. We discuss the completeness of the sample\nand our construction of a likelihood analysis. Using a relation between mass\n$M$ and SZ signal $Y$ calibrated to X-ray measurements, we derive constraints\non the power spectrum amplitude $\\sigma_8$ and matter density parameter\n$\\Omega_{\\mathrm{m}}$ in a flat $\\Lambda$CDM model. We test the robustness of\nour estimates and find that possible biases in the $Y$--$M$ relation and the\nhalo mass function are larger than the statistical uncertainties from the\ncluster sample. Assuming the X-ray determined mass to be biased low relative to\nthe true mass by between zero and 30%, motivated by comparison of the observed\nmass scaling relations to those from a set of numerical simulations, we find\nthat $\\sigma_8=0.75\\pm 0.03$, $\\Omega_{\\mathrm{m}}=0.29\\pm 0.02$, and\n$\\sigma_8(\\Omega_{\\mathrm{m}}/0.27)^{0.3} = 0.764 \\pm 0.025$. The value of\n$\\sigma_8$ is degenerate with the mass bias; if the latter is fixed to a value\nof 20% we find $\\sigma_8(\\Omega_{\\mathrm{m}}/0.27)^{0.3}=0.78\\pm 0.01$ and a\ntighter one-dimensional range $\\sigma_8=0.77\\pm 0.02$. We find that the larger\nvalues of $\\sigma_8$ and $\\Omega_{\\mathrm{m}}$ preferred by Planck's\nmeasurements of the primary CMB anisotropies can be accommodated by a mass bias\nof about 40%.

The\nPlanck nominal mission temperature anisotropy measurements, combined with the\nWMAP large-angle polarization, constrain the scalar spectral index to $n_s =\n0.9603 \\pm 0.0073$, ruling out exact scale invariance at over 5 $\\sigma$.\nPlanck establishes an upper bound on the tensor-to-scalar ratio of r < 0.11\n(95% CL). The Planck data thus shrink the space of allowed standard\ninflationary models, preferring potentials with V\" < 0. Exponential potential\nmodels, the simplest hybrid inflationary models, and monomial potential models\nof degree n > 2 do not provide a good fit to the data. Planck does not find\nstatistically significant running of the scalar spectral index, obtaining $d\nn_s/d ln k = -0.0134 \\pm 0.0090$. Several analyses dropping the slow-roll\napproximation are carried out, including detailed model comparison and\ninflationary potential reconstruction. We also investigate whether the\nprimordial power spectrum contains any features. We find that models with a\nparameterized oscillatory feature improve the fit $\\chi^2$ by ~ 10; however,\nBayesian evidence does not prefer these models.

Deviations from isotropy have been found and demonstrated to\nbe robust against component separation algorithm, mask choice and frequency\ndependence. Many of these anomalies were previously observed in the WMAP data,\nand are now confirmed at similar levels of significance (about 3 sigma).\nHowever, we find little evidence for non-Gaussianity, with the exception of a\nfew statistical signatures that seem to be associated with specific anomalies.\nIn particular, we find that the quadrupole-octopole alignment is also connected\nto a low observed variance of the CMB signal. A power asymmetry is now found to\npersist to scales corresponding to about l=600, and can be described in the\nlow-l regime by a phenomenological dipole modulation model. However, any\nprimordial power asymmetry is strongly scale-dependent and does not extend to\narbitrarily small angular scales. Finally, it is plausible that some of these\nfeatures may be reflected in the angular power spectrum of the data, which\nshows a deficit of power on similar scales. Indeed, when the power spectra of\ntwo hemispheres defined by a preferred direction are considered separately, one\nshows evidence for a deficit in power, while its opposite contains oscillations\nbetween odd and even modes that may be related to the parity violation and\nphase correlations also detected in the data.

Using three\noptimal bispectrum estimators, separable template-fitting (KSW), binned, and\nmodal, we obtain consistent values for the primordial local, equilateral, and\northogonal bispectrum amplitudes, quoting as our final result fNL^local=\n2.7+/-5.8, fNL^equil= -42+/-75, and fNL^ortho= -25+\\-39 (68% CL statistical).\nNG is detected in the data; using skew-C_l statistics we find a nonzero\nbispectrum from residual point sources, and the ISW-lensing bispectrum at a\nlevel expected in the LambdaCDM scenario. The results are based on\ncomprehensive cross-validation of these estimators on Gaussian and non-Gaussian\nsimulations, are stable across component separation techniques, pass an\nextensive suite of tests, and are confirmed by skew-C_l, wavelet bispectrum and\nMinkowski functional estimators. Beyond estimates of individual shape\namplitudes, we present model-independent, 3-dimensional reconstructions of the\nPlanck CMB bispectrum and thus derive constraints on early-Universe scenarios\nthat generate primordial NG, including general single-field models of\ninflation, excited initial states (non-Bunch-Davies vacua), and\ndirectionally-dependent vector models. We provide an initial survey of\nscale-dependent feature and resonance models.

The Planck data\nsignificantly limit the viable parameter space of the ekpyrotic/cyclic\nscenarios. The amplitude of the 4-point function in the local model tauNL <\n2800 (95% CL).

We describe forecasts of the CMB power spectrum\ninduced by cosmic strings, calculating these from network models and\nsimulations using line-of-sight Boltzmann solvers. We have studied Nambu-Goto\ncosmic strings, as well as field theory strings for which radiative effects are\nimportant, thus spanning the range of theoretical uncertainty in strings\nmodels. We have added the angular power spectrum from strings to that for a\nsimple adiabatic model, with the extra fraction defined as $f_{10}$ at\nmultipole $\\ell=10$. This parameter has been added to the standard six\nparameter fit using COSMOMC with flat priors. For the Nambu-Goto string model,\nwe have obtained a constraint on the string tension of $G\\mu/c^2 < 1.5 x\n10^{-7}$ and $f_{10} < 0.015$ at 95% confidence that can be improved to\n$G\\mu/c^2 < 1.3 x 10^{-7}$ and $f_{10} < 0.010$ on inclusion of high-$\\ell$ CMB\ndata. For the abelian-Higgs field theory model we find, $G\\mu_{AH}/c^2 < 3.2 x\n10^{-7}$ and $f_{10} < 0.028$. The marginalized likelihoods for $f_{10}$ and in\nthe $f_{10}$--$\\Omega_b h^2$ plane are also presented. We have also obtained\nconstraints on $f_{10}$ for models with semi-local strings and global textures\nfor which $G\\mu/c^2 < 1.1 x 10^{-6}$. We have made complementarity searches for\nthe specific non-Gaussian signatures of cosmic strings, calibrating with\nall-sky Planck resolution CMB maps generated from networks of\npost-recombination strings.

We search for topology with a fundamental domain\nnearly intersecting the last scattering surface (comoving distance $\\chi_r$).\nFor most topologies studied the likelihood maximized over orientation shows\nsome preference for multi-connected models just larger than $\\chi_r$. This\neffect is also present in simulated realizations of isotropic maps and we\ninterpret it as the alignment of mild anisotropic correlations with chance\nfeatures in a single realization; such a feature can also exist, in milder\nform, when the likelihood is marginalized over orientations. Thus marginalized,\nthe limits on the radius $R_i$ of the largest sphere inscribed in a topological\ndomain (at log-likelihood-ratio -5) are: in a flat Universe, $R_i>0.9\\chi_r$\nfor the cubic torus (cf. $R_i>0.9\\chi_r$ at 99% CL for a matched-circles\nsearch); $R_i>0.7\\chi_r$ for the chimney; $R_i>0.5\\chi_r$ for the slab; in a\npositively curved Universe, $R_i>1.0\\chi_r$ for the dodecahedron;\n$R_i>1.0\\chi_r$ for the truncated cube; $R_i>0.9\\chi_r$ for the octahedron.\nSimilar limits apply to alternate topologies. We perform a Bayesian search for\nan anisotropic Bianchi VII$_h$ geometry. In a non-physical setting where the\nBianchi parameters are decoupled from cosmology, Planck data favour a Bianchi\ncomponent with a Bayes factor of at least 1.5 units of log-evidence: a Bianchi\npattern is efficient at accounting for some large-scale anomalies in Planck\ndata. However, the cosmological parameters are in strong disagreement with\nthose found from CMB anisotropy data alone. In the physically motivated setting\nwhere the Bianchi parameters are fitted simultaneously with standard\ncosmological parameters, we find no evidence for a Bianchi VII$_h$ cosmology\nand constrain the vorticity of such models: $(\\omega/H)_0<8\\times10^{-10}$ (95%\nCL).

For the whole cluster sample of average redshift\n0.18, the measured average radial peculiar velocity with respect to the cosmic\nmicrowave background (CMB) radiation at that redshift, i.e., the kSZ monopole,\namounts to $72 \\pm 60$ km s$^{-1}$.

The primary is a B3 star (~6Msun) but the nature of the secondary\n(~2Msun) has long been mysterious, since the duration and shape of primary\neclipse are inappropriate for ordinary stars. Here we report nearly continuous\nphotometric observations obtained with the MOST satellite over ~4 cycles of the\n6.47d binary period. The light curve is of unprecedented quality, revealing a\ndeep, symmetric primary eclipse as well as a clear reflection effect and\nsecondary eclipse. In addition, there are other small disturbances, some of\nwhich repeat at the same phase over the four cycles monitored. The shape of the\nprimary light curve has clearly evolved significantly over the past 40 yr.\nWhile its overall duration and depth have remained roughly constant, the slopes\nof the descent and ascent phases are significantly shallower now than in the\npast and its distinctive flat-bottomed \"pseudo-totality\" is much less obvious\nor even absent in the most recent data. We further demonstrate that the primary\neclipse was detected at X-ray wavelengths during the Chandra COUP study. The\nlight curve continues to be well modeled by a self-luminous and reflective\ndisk-shaped object seen nearly edge-on orbiting the primary. The dramatic\nchange in shape over four decades is modeled as an opacity variation in a\ntenuous outer envelope or disk of the secondary object. We presume that the\nsecondary is an extremely young protostar at an earlier evolutionary phase than\ncan be commonly observed elsewhere in the Galaxy and that the opacity\nvariations observed are related to its digestion of some accreted matter over\nthe last 50-100 yr. Indeed, this object deserves continued observational and\ntheoretical attention as the youngest known eclipsing binary system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Mar 2013 20:19:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-19"}

To understand the spatial and temporal effects in the heliosheath,\nit is important to study these effects separately. In this work we explore the\nrole of shocks as one type of temporal effects in the dynamics of the\nheliosheath.

The fluctuation amplitudes of\nthe plasma parameters vary with heliocentric distance. The interaction of the\npair of shocks with the TS creates a variety of new waves and discontinuities\nin the heliosheath, which produce a highly variable solar wind flow.

Given two sets of data from distinct physical models, the main\nobjective is to obtain a unified characterization of inclusions within the\nspatial domain of the physical properties to be reconstructed. Although our\nproposed method generally applies to many types of inversion problems, the main\nmotivation here is to characterize subsurface contaminant source-zones by\nprocessing down gradient hydrological data and cross-gradient electrical\nresistance tomography (ERT) observations.

The represented stimuli, however, vary substantially among\ndifferent sensory modalities and different neurons. The goal of this paper is\nto determine which kind of stimulus features can be encoded in burst length,\nand how those features depend on the mathematical properties of the underlying\ndynamical system. We show that the initiation and termination of each burst is\ntriggered by specific stimulus features whose temporal characteristsics are\ndetermined by the types of bifurcations that initiate and terminate firing in\neach burst. As only a few bifurcations are possible, only a restricted number\nof encoded features exists. Here we focus specifically on describing parabolic,\nsquare-wave and elliptic bursters. We find that parabolic bursters, whose\nfiring is initiated and terminated by saddle-node bifurcations, behave as\nprototypical integrators: Firing is triggered by depolarizing stimuli, and\nlasts for as long as excitation is prolonged. Elliptic bursters, contrastingly,\nconstitute prototypical resonators, since both the initiating and terminating\nbifurcations possess well-defined oscillation time scales. Firing is therefore\ntriggered by stimulus stretches of matching frequency and terminated by a\nphase-inversion in the oscillation. The behavior of square-wave bursters is\nsomewhat intermediate, since they are triggered by a fold bifurcation of cycles\nof well-defined frequency but are terminated by a homoclinic bifurcation\nlacking an oscillating time scale. These correspondences show that stimulus\nselectivity is determined by the type of bifurcations.

The main novel idea\nis to replace the classical polynomial model which is suitable for describing\nsmooth functions by arbitrary models that are purpose-built for the problem at\nhand. In particular, this allows to describe the local behaviour not only of\nfunctions but also of large classes of distributions.\n  We then build a calculus allowing to perform the various operations\n(multiplication, composition with smooth functions, integration against\nsingular kernels) necessary to formulate fixed point equations for a very large\nclass of semilinear PDEs driven by some very singular (typically random) input.\nThis allows, for the first time, to give a mathematically rigorous meaning to\nmany interesting stochastic PDEs arising in physics. The theory comes with\nconvergence results that allow to interpret the solutions obtained in this way\nas limits of classical solutions to regularised problems, possibly modified by\nthe addition of diverging counterterms. These counterterms arise naturally\nthrough the action of a \"renormalisation group\" which is defined canonically in\nterms of the regularity structure associated to the given class of PDEs.\n  As an example of a novel application, we solve the long-standing problem of\nbuilding a natural Markov process that is symmetric with respect to the (finite\nvolume) measure describing the $\\Phi^4_3$ Euclidean quantum field theory. It is\nnatural to conjecture that the Markov process built in this way describes the\nGlauber dynamic of 3-dimensional ferromagnets near their critical temperature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Mar 2013 22:41:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 May 2013 15:03:59 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 13 Aug 2013 17:05:57 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 15 Feb 2014 14:39:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

Semantic outliers are computed between regions of\ninterest, where objects have similar movement intention, and there exist\nstandard paths which connect the regions. We show with experiments on real data\nthat the method finds semantic outliers from trajectory data that are not\ndiscovered by similar approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Mar 2013 00:28:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-22"}

An $n$-ary Huffman tree is a connected, cycle-lacking graph where each\nvertex can have either $n$ \"children\" vertices connecting to it, or 0 children.\nVertices with 0 children are called \\textit{leaves}. We let $h_n(q)$ represent\nthe total number of $n$-ary Huffman trees with $q$ leaves.

By comparing\nobservations from the SOHO/LASCO, IPS, and in situ, we then identify 39 ICMEs\nthat could be analyzed carefully. Here, we define two speeds V_SOHO and V_bg,\nwhich are initial speed of ICME and the speed of the background solar wind,\nrespectively. Examinations of these speeds yield the following results; i) Fast\nICMEs (with V_SOHO - V_bg > 500 km/s) rapidly decelerate, moderate ICMEs (with\n0 km/s < V_SOHO - V_bg < 500 km/s) show either gradually decelerating or\nuniform motion, and slow ICMEs (with V_SOHO - V_bg < 0 km/s) accelerate. The\nradial speeds converge on the speed of background solar wind during their\noutward propagation. We subsequently find; ii) both the acceleration and\ndeceleration are nearly complete by 0.79 (+/- 0.04) AU, and those are ended\nwhen the ICME speed reaches a given speed. We find the value of that to be 480\n(+/- 21) km/s. iii) For the fast and moderate ICMEs, a linear equation with a\nconstant coefficient is more appropriate than a quadratic equation to describe\ntheir kinematics, because the chi-square for the linear equation satisfies the\nstatistical significance level of 0.05, while the quadratic one is not. These\nresults support the hypothesis that the radial motion of ICMEs is governed by a\ndrag force due to interaction with the background solar wind. These findings\nalso suggest that ICMEs propagating faster than background solar wind are\ncontrolled mainly by the hydrodynamic Stokes drag.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Mar 2013 03:43:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 29 Mar 2013 16:02:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 30 Jan 2014 15:53:04 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 7 Dec 2014 17:38:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-09"}

The practical passive eavesdropping scenario we\nconsider is where channel state information (CSI) from the eavesdropper is not\navailable at the transmitter. Our new scheme is carried out in two steps.\nFirst, the transmitter selects the first two strongest antennas based on the\nfeedback from the receiver, which maximizes the instantaneous signal-to-noise\nratio (SNR) of the transmitter-receiver channel. Second, the Alamouti scheme is\nemployed at the selected antennas in order to perform data transmission. At the\nreceiver and the eavesdropper, maximal-ratio combining is applied in order to\nexploit the multiple antennas.We derive a new closed-form expression for the\nsecrecy outage probability in nonidentical Rayleigh fading, and using this\nresult, we then present the probability of non-zero secrecy capacity in closed\nform and the {\\epsilon}-outage secrecy capacity in numerical form.

The proposed investigation is motivated by the\nproblem of reactive infiltration of molten silicon into carbon preforms. This\nis a complex phenomenon arising from the interplay between fluid flow, the\ntransition to wetting, surface growth and heat transfer. Furthermore, it is\ncharacterized by slow infiltration velocities in narrow interstices resulting\nin small Reynolds numbers that are difficult to reproduce with a single\ncapillary.

The instrumental conclusion drawn from our\nsimulations is that short pores with wide openings and a round-shaped\nmorphology near the throats represent the optimal configuration for the\nunderlying structure of the porous preform in order to achieve faster\ninfiltration.

When a control design is based on an estimated model, the\nachievable performance is related to the quality of the estimate. The\ndegradation in control performance due to errors in the estimated model is\nmeasured by an application cost function. In order to use an optimization based\ninput design method, a convex approximation of the set of models that atisfies\nthe control specification is required. The standard approach is to use a\nquadratic approximation of the application cost function, where the main\ncomputational effort is to find the corresponding Hessian matrix. Our main\ncontribution is an alternative approach for this problem, which uses the\nstructure of the underlying optimal control problem to considerably reduce the\ncomputations needed to find the application set. This technique allows the use\nof applications oriented input design for MPC on much more complex plants.

The full extent of the CNC\nwas mapped with PACS and SPIRE from 70 to 500 micron. We determine temperatures\nand column densities at each point in this maps by modeling the observed FIR\nSEDs. We also derive a map showing the strength of the UV field.

Our Herschel maps resolve, for the first time, the small-scale\nstructure of the dense clouds.

Our method --- `truncate, replicate, sample' (TRS) ---\nrecognises that IPF weights consist of both `replication weights' and\n`conventional weights', the effects of which need to be separated. The\nprocedure consists of three steps: 1) separate replication and conventional\nweights by truncation; 2) replication of individuals with positive integer\nweights; and 3) probabilistic sampling. The results, which are reproducible\nusing supplementary code and data published alongside this paper, show that TRS\nis fast, and more accurate than alternative approaches to integerisation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Mar 2013 11:04:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-22"}

The basic\ntheorems of model theory work and can be generalized (like Los theorem), but\ncan we generalize deeper parts of model theory? The first section tries to sort\nout what occurs to the notion of stable T for complete L_{theta,theta}-theories\nT. We generalize several properties of complete first order T, equivalent to\nbeing stable (see [Sh:c]) and find out which implications hold and which fail.\nIn particular, can we generalize stability enough to generalize [Sh:c, Ch. VI]?\nLet us concentrate on saturation in the local sense (types consisting of\ninstances of one formula). We prove that at least we can characterize the T's\n(of cardinality < theta for simplicity) which are minimal for appropriate\ncardinal lambda > 2^kappa +|T| in each of the following two senses. One is\ngeneralizing Keisler order which measures how saturated are ultrapowers.\nAnother asks: Is there an L_{theta,theta}-theory T_1 supseteq T of cardinality\n|T| + 2^theta such that for every model M_1 of T_1 of cardinality > lambda, the\ntau(T)-reduct M of M_1 is lambda^+-saturated. Moreover, the two versions of\nstable used in the characterization are different.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Mar 2013 12:53:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 27 Apr 2014 11:53:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 17 Nov 2015 10:53:25 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 10 Mar 2019 12:41:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-12"}

Then we develop the quantum\nmeasurement-chain formula beyond the framework of completely positive map in\norder to describe much broader quantum dynamics, and therein the property of\ncontextuality could be captured via measurement transfer matrix.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Mar 2013 14:34:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-22"}

These protocols are useful to counteract the\nspectral inefficiency of repetition-based cooperation. We provide a general\nanalytical framework for analysis and design of wireless networks using the\nDemodulate-and-Forward (DemF) protocol with binary Network Coding (NC) at the\nrelays and Cooperative Maximal Ratio Combining (C-MRC) at the destination. Our\nsystem model encompasses an arbitrary number of relays which offer two\ncooperation levels: i) full-cooperative relays, which postpone the transmission\nof their own data frames to help the transmission of the sources via DemF\nrelaying and binary NC; and ii) partial-cooperative relays, which exploit NC to\ntransmit their own data frames along with the packets received from the\nsources. The relays can apply NC on different subsets of sources, which is\nshown to provide the sources with unequal diversity orders. Guidelines to\nchoose the packets to be combined, i.e., the network code, to achieve the\ndesired diversity order are given. Our study shows that partial-cooperative\nrelays provide no contribution to the diversity order of the sources.\nTheoretical findings and design guidelines are validated through extensive\nMonte Carlo simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Mar 2013 15:48:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}
