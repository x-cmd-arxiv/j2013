Their interpretation involves reflection of\na hard source of photons onto an accretion disk, producing a delayed reflected\nemission, with a time lag consistent with the light travel time between the\nirradiating source and the disk. Independently of the location of the clock,\nthe kHz Quasi-Periodic Oscillation (QPO) emission is thought to arise from the\nneutron star boundary layer. Here, we search for the signature of reverberation\nof the kHz QPO emission, by measuring the soft lags and the lag energy spectrum\nof the lower kHz QPOs from 4U1608-52. Soft lags, ranging from ~15 to ~40\nmicroseconds, between the 3-8 keV and 8-30 keV modulated emissions are detected\nbetween 565 and 890 Hz. The soft lags are not constant with frequency and show\na smooth decrease between 680 Hz and 890 Hz. The broad band X-ray spectrum is\nmodeled as the sum of a disk and a thermal comptonized component, plus a broad\niron line, expected from reflection. The spectral parameters follow a smooth\nrelationship with the QPO frequency, in particular the fitted inner disk radius\ndecreases steadily with frequency. Both the bump around the iron line in the\nlag energy spectrum, and the consistency between the lag changes and the\ninferred changes of the inner disk radius, from either spectral fitting or the\nQPO frequency, suggest that the soft lags may indeed involve reverberation of\nthe hard pulsating QPO source on the disk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Mar 2013 16:28:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 20 Apr 2013 13:01:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

A key issue in\nthese settings, where direct monitoring is infeasible, is incentivizing agents\nin the `crowd' to put in effort to make good evaluations, as well as to\ntruthfully report their evaluations. This leads to a new family of information\nelicitation problems with unobservable ground truth, where an agent's\nproficiency- the probability with which she correctly evaluates the underlying\nground truth- is endogenously determined by her strategic choice of how much\neffort to put into the task.\n  Our main contribution is a simple, new, mechanism for binary information\nelicitation for multiple tasks when agents have endogenous proficiencies, with\nthe following properties: (i) Exerting maximum effort followed by truthful\nreporting of observations is a Nash equilibrium. (ii) This is the equilibrium\nwith maximum payoff to all agents, even when agents have different maximum\nproficiencies, can use mixed strategies, and can choose a different strategy\nfor each of their tasks. Our information elicitation mechanism requires only\nminimal bounds on the priors, asks agents to only report their own evaluations,\nand does not require any conditions on a diverging number of agent reports per\ntask to achieve its incentive properties. The main idea behind our mechanism is\nto use the presence of multiple tasks and ratings to identify and penalize\nlow-effort agreement: the mechanism rewards agents for agreeing with a\n`reference' rater on a task but also penalizes for blind agreement by\nsubtracting out a statistic term designed so that agents obtain reward only\nwhen they put effort into their observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Mar 2013 19:10:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-05"}

Certain GNRs also exhibit a peculiar\ngapped magnetic phase for which the half-metallic state can be induced as well\nas the topologically non-trivial quantum spin Hall electronic phase. Because\ntheir electronic properties are highly tunable, GNRs have quickly become a\npopular subject of research toward the design of graphene-based nanostructures\nfor technological applications. This Account presents a pedagogical overview of\nthe various degrees of freedom in the atomic structure and interactions that\nresearchers can use to tailor the electronic structure of these materials.

Synonymous mutations do not\naffect this interplay and are often assumed to be neutral. We analyze\nlongitudinal intrapatient data from the C2-V5 part of the envelope gene (env)\nand observe that synonymous derived alleles rarely fix even though they often\nreach high frequencies in the viral population. We find that synonymous\nmutations that disrupt base pairs in RNA stems flanking the variable loops of\ngp120 are more likely to be lost than other synonymous changes, hinting at a\ndirect fitness effect of these stem-loop structures in the HIV-1 RNA.\nComputational modeling indicates that these synonymous mutations have a\n(Malthusian) selection coefficient of the order of -0.002 and that they are\nbrought up to high frequency by hitchhiking on neighboring beneficial\nnonsynonymous alleles. The patterns of fixation of nonsynonymous mutations\nestimated from the longitudinal data and comparisons with computer models\nsuggest that escape mutations in C2-V5 are only transiently beneficial, either\nbecause the immune system is catching up or because of competition between\nequivalent escapes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Mar 2013 19:41:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-25"}

As a result it was hard\nto judge if two different fixed-point tensors described the same quantum phase\nor not. We want to improve that approach by giving a more physical description\nof the topological orders. We find that the non-Abelian Berry's phases, $T$-\nand $S$-matrices, of the topological protected degenerate ground states on a\ntorus give rise to a more physical description of topological orders. Using the\nVerlinde conjecture, we can even choose the canonical basis for the $T$- and\n$S$-matrices.

Many attempts to simulate hot, warm, and cold dark\nmatter cosmologies with a free streaming cutoff have been performed with\ncosmological particle-based simulations, but they all suffer from spurious\nstructure formation at scales below their respective free streaming scales --\ni.e. where the physics of halo formation is most affected by free streaming. We\nperform a series of high resolution numerical simulations of different WDM\nmodels, and develop an approximate method to subtract artificial structures in\nthe measured halo mass function. The corrected measurements are then used to\nconstruct and calibrate an extended Press-Schechter (EPS) model with sharp-$k$\nwindow function and adequate mass assignment. The EPS model gives accurate\npredictions for the low redshift halo mass function of CDM and WDM models, but\nit significantly under-predicts the halo abundance at high redshifts. By taking\ninto account the ellipticity of the initial patches and connecting the\ncharacteristic filter scale to the smallest ellipsoidal axis, we are able to\neliminate this inconsistency and obtain an accurate mass function over all\nredshifts and all dark matter particle masses covered by the simulations. As an\nadditional application we use our model to predict the microhalo abundance of\nthe standard neutralino-CDM scenario and we give the first quantitative\nprediction of the mass function over the full range of scales of CDM structure\nformation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Mar 2013 21:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Mar 2013 20:49:46 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 11 Jun 2013 10:21:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

Taking advantage of\nHalpha3 which provides the complete census of the recent star-forming, HI-rich\ngalaxies in the local universe, we aim to investigate the structural parameters\nof both the young (<10 Myr) and the old (>1 Gyr) stellar populations. By\ncomparing the sizes of these stellar components we investigated the spatial\nscale on which galaxies are growing at the present cosmological epoch and the\nrole of the environment in quenching the star-formation activity. We computed\nthe concentration, asymmetry, and clumpiness structural parameters. To quantify\nthe sizes we computed half-light radii and a new parameter dubbed EW/r. The\nconcentration index computed in the r band depends on the stellar mass and on\nthe Hubble type, these variables being related since most massive galaxies are\nbulge dominated thus most concentrated. Going toward later spirals and\nirregulars both the concentration index and the stellar mass decrease. Blue\nCompact dwarfs represent an exception since they have similar stellar mass but\nthey are more concentrated than dwarf irregulars. The asymmetry and the\nclumpiness increase along the spiral sequence then they decrease going into the\ndwarf regime, where the light distribution is smooth and more symmetric. When\nmeasured on Halpha images, the CAS parameters do not exhibit obvious\ncorrelations with Hubble type.

Assuming uniform elemental abundances this reduces to having\na good estimate of the total hydrogen column density, N(Htot)=N(HI)+2N(H2). The\natomic component, N(HI), is reliably provided using the mapped 21 cm radio\nemission but estimating the molecular hydrogen column density, N(H2), expected\nfor any particular direction, is difficult. The X-ray afterglows of GRBs are\nideal sources to probe X-ray absorption in our Galaxy because they are\nextragalactic, numerous, bright, have simple spectra and occur randomly across\nthe entire sky. We describe an empirical method, utilizing 493 afterglows\ndetected by the Swift XRT, to determine N(Htot) through the Milky Way which\nprovides an improved estimate of the X-ray absorption in our Galaxy and thereby\nleads to more reliable measurements of the intrinsic X-ray absorption and,\npotentially, other spectral parameters, for extragalactic X-ray sources. We\nderive a simple function, dependent on the product of the atomic hydrogen\ncolumn density, N(HI), and dust extinction, E(B-V), which describes the\nvariation of the molecular hydrogen column density, N(H2), of our Galaxy, over\nthe sky. Using the resulting N(Htot) we show that the dust-to-hydrogen ratio is\ncorrelated with the carbon monoxide emission and use this ratio to estimate the\nfraction of material which forms interstellar dust grains.

The extra\ncomponent is usually assumed to be due to absorbing gas lying within the host\ngalaxy of the GRB itself. There is an apparent correlation between the\nequivalent column density of hydrogen, N(H,intrinsic) (assuming it to be at the\nGRB redshift), and redshift, z, with the few z>6 GRBs showing the greatest\nintrinsic column densities. We investigate the N(H,intrinsic) - z relation\nusing a large sample of Swift GRBs, as well as active galactic nuclei (AGN) and\nquasar samples, paying particular attention to the spectral energy\ndistributions of the two highest redshift GRBs. Various possible sample biases\nand systematics that might produce such a correlation are considered, and we\nconclude that the correlation is very likely to be real. This may indicate\neither an evolutionary effect in the host galaxy properties, or a contribution\nfrom gas along the line-of-sight, in the diffuse intergalactic medium (IGM) or\nintervening absorbing clouds. Employing a more realistic model for IGM\nabsorption than in previous works, we find that this may explain much of the\nobserved opacity at z>~3 providing it is not too hot, likely between 10^5 K and\n10^6.5 K, and moderately metal enriched, Z~0.2 Z_sun. This material could\ntherefore constitute the Warm Hot Intergalactic Medium. However, a comparable\nlevel of absorption is also expected from the cumulative effect of intervening\ncold gas clouds, and given current uncertainties it is not possible to say\nwhich, if either, dominates. At lower redshifts, we conclude that gas in the\nhost galaxies must be the dominant contributor to the observed X-ray\nabsorption.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Mar 2013 21:00:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

Social\nscientists have developed influential theories about the role of network\nstructure in information access. These theories were validated through numerous\nstudies, which examined how individuals leverage their social networks for\ncompetitive advantage, such as a new job or higher compensation. It is not\nclear how these theories generalize to online networks, which differ from\nreal-world social networks in important respects, including asymmetry of social\nlinks. We address this problem by analyzing how users of the social news\naggregator Digg adopt stories recommended by friends, i.e., users they follow.\nWe measure the impact different factors, such as network position and activity\nrate; have on access to novel information, which in Digg's case means set of\ndistinct news stories. We show that a user can improve his information access\nby linking to active users, though this becomes less effective as the number of\nfriends, or their activity, grows due to structural network constraints. These\nconstraints arise because users in structurally diverse position within the\nfollower graph have topically diverse interests from their friends. Moreover,\nthough in most cases user's friends are exposed to almost all the information\navailable in the network, after they make their recommendations, the user sees\nonly a small fraction of the available information. Our study suggests that\ncognitive and structural bottlenecks limit access to novel information in\nonline social networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Mar 2013 21:18:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-06"}

Our main dynamical analysis will\nbe focused on the behavior of the primary galaxy. We investigate in detail the\nregular or chaotic nature of motion, in two different cases: (i) the\ntime-independent model in both 2D and 3D dynamical systems and (ii) the\ntime-evolving 3D model. Our numerical calculations indicate that the percentage\nof the chaotic orbits increases when the primary galaxy has a dense and massive\nnucleus. The presence of the dense galactic core also increases the stellar\nvelocities near the center of the galaxy. Moreover, for small values of the\ndistance R between the two bodies, low-energy stars display chaotic motion,\nnear the central region of the galaxy, while for larger values of the distance\nR, the motion in active galaxies is entirely regular for low-energy stars. Our\nsimulations suggest that in galaxies with a satellite companion, the chaotic\nnature of motion is not only a result of the galactic interaction between the\nprimary galaxy and its companion, but also a result caused by the presence of\nthe dense nucleus in the core of the primary galaxy. Theoretical arguments are\npresented in order to support and interpret the numerically derived outcomes.\nFurthermore, we follow the 3D evolution of the primary galaxy, when mass is\ntransported adiabatically from the disk to the nucleus.

When maize was domesticated from teosinte, the\nnumber and arrangement of ears changed dramatically. Teosinte has long lateral\nbranches that bear multiple small ears at their nodes and tassels at their\ntips. Maize has much shorter lateral branches that are tipped by a single large\near with no additional ears at the branch nodes. To investigate the genetic\nbasis of this difference in prolificacy (the number of ears on a plant), we\nperformed a genome-wide QTL scan. A large effect QTL for prolificacy (prol1.1)\nwas detected on the short arm of chromosome one in a location that has\npreviously been shown to influence multiple domestication traits. We\nfine-mapped prol1.1 to a 2.7 kb interval or causative region upstream of the\ngrassy tillers1 gene, which encodes a homeodomain leucine zipper transcription\nfactor. Tissue in situ hybridizations reveal that the maize allele of prol1.1\nis associated with up-regulation of gt1 expression in the nodal plexus. Given\nthat maize does not initiate secondary ear buds, the expression of gt1 in the\nnodal plexus in maize may suppress their initiation. Population genetic\nanalyses indicate positive selection on the maize allele of prol1.1, causing a\npartial sweep that fixed the maize allele throughout most of domesticated\nmaize. This work shows how a subtle cis-regulatory change in tissue specific\ngene expression altered plant architecture in a way that improved the\nharvestability of maize.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Mar 2013 22:35:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-30"}

Using adaptive\noptics at the W.M. Keck Observatory, we have obtained spatially resolved\nspectra of most of the disk of Europa at a spectral resolution ~40 times higher\nthan seen by the Galileo spacecraft. These spectra show a previously undetected\ndistinct signature of magnesium sulfate salts on Europa, but the magnesium\nsulfate is confined to the trailing hemisphere and spatially correlated with\nthe presence of radiation products like sulfuric acid and SO2. On the leading,\nless irradiated, hemisphere, our observations rule out the presence of many of\nthe proposed sulfate salts, but do show the presence of distorted water ice\nbands. Based on the association of the potential MgSO4, detection on the\ntrailing side with other radiation products, we conclude that MgSO4 is also a\nradiation product, rather than a constituent of a Europa ocean brine. Based on\nocean chemistry models, we hypothesize that, prior to irradiation, magnesium is\nprimarily in the form of MgCl2, and we predict that NaCl and KCl are even more\nabundant, and, in fact, dominate the non-ice component of the leading\nhemisphere.

The contributions from\nstatistical fluctuations and detector effects were subtracted from the\n(co-)variance of the observed charge multiplicity asymmetries. In the mid- to\nmost-central collisions, the same- (opposite-) sign pairs are preferentially\nemitted in back-to-back (aligned on the same-side) directions. The charge\nseparation across the event plane, measured by the difference, $\\Delta$,\nbetween the like- and unlike-sign up/down $-$ left/right correlations, is\nlargest near the event plane.

When rapid adaptation is driven by rare alleles from the standing\ngenetic variation or by a high population rate of de novo adaptive mutation,\npositive selection should commonly generate soft rather that hard selective\nsweeps. In a soft sweep, multiple adaptive haplotypes sweep through the\npopulation simultaneously, in contrast to hard sweeps in which only a single\nadaptive haplotype rises to high frequency. Current statistical methods were\nnot designed to detect soft sweeps, and are therefore likely to miss these\npossibly numerous adaptive events. Here, we develop a statistical test (H12)\nbased on haplotype homozygosity that is capable of detecting both hard and soft\nsweeps with similar power. We use H12 to identify multiple genomic regions that\nhave undergone recent and strong adaptation in a population sample of fully\nsequenced Drosophila melanogaster strains from the Drosophila Genetic Reference\nPanel (DGRP). Visual inspection of the top 50 peaks revealed that multiple\nhaplotypes are at high frequency, consistent with signatures of soft sweep. We\ndeveloped a second statistic (H2/H1) that is sensitive to signatures common to\nsoft sweeps but not hard sweeps, in order to determine whether sweeps detected\nby H12 can be more easily generated by hard versus soft sweeps. Surprisingly,\nwe find that the H12 and H2/H1 values for all top 50 peaks are more easily\ngenerated by soft sweeps than hard sweeps under several evolutionary scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Mar 2013 01:59:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Jan 2014 22:58:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 2 Nov 2014 22:08:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-04"}

We address this question by analysing the history of dark\nmatter subhaloes in the Millennium-II cosmological simulation. A semi-analytic\nmodel serves as the link to observations. We argue that a reasonable analogue\nto early morphological types or red-sequence dwarf galaxies are those subhaloes\nthat experienced strong mass loss, or alternatively those that have spent a\nlong time in massive haloes. This approach reproduces well the observed\nmorphology-distance relation of dwarf galaxies in the Virgo and Coma clusters,\nand thus provides insight into their history. Over their lifetime, present-day\nlate types have experienced an amount of environmental influence similar to\nwhat the progenitors of dwarf ellipticals had already experienced at redshifts\nabove two. Therefore, dwarf ellipticals are more likely to be a result of early\nand continuous environmental influence in group- and cluster-size haloes,\nrather than a recent transformation product. The observed morphological\nsequences of late-type and early-type galaxies have developed in parallel, not\nconsecutively. Consequently, the characteristics of today's late-type galaxies\nare not necessarily representative for the progenitors of today's dwarf\nellipticals. Studies aiming to reproduce the present-day dwarf population thus\nneed to start at early epochs, model the influence of various environments, and\nalso take into account the evolution of the environments themselves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Mar 2013 05:15:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 Mar 2013 02:35:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

However, the properties of network coding also make the\npollution attack more serious. In this paper, we give an unconditional secure\nauthentication scheme for network coding based on a linear code $C$.\nSafavi-Naini and Wang gave an authentication code for multi-receivers and\nmultiple messages. We notice that the scheme of Safavi-Naini and Wang is\nessentially constructed with Reed-Solomon codes. And we modify their\nconstruction slightly to make it serve for authenticating subspace codes over\nlinear network. Also, we generalize the construction with linear codes. The\ngeneralization to linear codes has the similar advantages as generalizing\nShamir's secret sharing scheme to linear secret sharing sceme based on linear\ncodes. One advantage of this generalization is that for a fixed message space,\nour scheme allows arbitrarily many receivers to check the integrity of their\nown messages, while the scheme with Reed-Solomon codes has a constraint on the\nnumber of verifying receivers. Another advantage is that we introduce access\nstructure in the generalized scheme. Massey characterized the access structure\nof linear secret sharing scheme by minimal codewords in the dual code whose\nfirst component is 1. We slightly modify the definition of minimal codewords.\nLet $C$ be a $[V,k]$ linear code.

We find stellar masses of M1 = 0.53 (0.02)\nMsun and M2 = 0.143 (0.006) Msun (mass ratio 0.27), and radii of R1 = 0.51\n(0.01) Rsun and R2 = 0.174 (0.006) Rsun.

The question which individuals should be\nimmunized in order to mitigate the impact of the virus on the rest of\npopulation has received quite some attention in the literature. The dynamics of\nthe of a virus spread through a population is often represented as information\nspread over a complex network. The strategies commonly proposed to determine\nwhich nodes are to be selected for immunization often involve only one\ncentrality measure at a time, while often the topology of the network seems to\nsuggest that a single metric is insufficient to capture the influence of a node\nentirely.\n  In this work we present a generic method based on a genetic algorithm (GA)\nwhich does not rely explicitly on any centrality measures during its search but\nonly exploits this type of information to narrow the search space. The fitness\nof an individual is defined as the estimated expected number of infections of a\nvirus following SIR dynamics. The proposed method is evaluated on two contact\nnetworks: the Goodreau's Faux Mesa high school and the US air transportation\nnetwork.

Furthermore, the distance is known\nto better than 5 percent, virtually eliminating it as a free parameter. The\nrotation curve is easily measured, since the H I (and stellar) disks are edge\non, and both the receding and approaching sides agree very well. In this paper\nwe explore the agreement between the model and observed rotation curves in MOND\ngiven that the only two free parameters available are the mass-to-light ratios\nof the bulge and disk. We use a grid based MOND Poisson solver that accurately\nsolves for the MOND gravity and produces our model rotation curves from a given\nmass distribution. The input to the Poisson solver is a 3D distribution of N\nparticles which is generated from modelling the observed distribution of stars\nand gas in the galaxy. By ensuring a superior fit to the radial surface\nbrightness profile than previous works, by virtue of a double Sersic fit to the\nbulge, we were able to produce excellent fits to the rotation curve with\ntypical values for both mass-to-light ratios. We conclude that the model\nrotation curve of a mass distribution in MOND is extremely sensitive to the\nbulge-disk decomposition and even slight deviation from the observed mass\ndistribution can produce large differences in the model rotation curve.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Mar 2013 11:42:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-06"}

Nowadays, a variety of formalisms are\nused to express properties on observed behavior of computer systems, and a lot\nof methods have been proposed to construct monitors. However, it is a frequent\nsituation when advanced formalisms and methods are not needed, because an\nexecutable model of the system is available. The original purpose and structure\nof the model are out of importance; rather what is required is that the system\nand its model have similar sets of interfaces. In this case, monitoring is\ncarried out as follows. Two \"black boxes\", the system and its reference model,\nare executed in parallel and stimulated with the same input sequences; the\nmonitor dynamically captures their output traces and tries to match them. The\nmain problem is that a model is usually more abstract than the real system,\nboth in terms of functionality and timing. Therefore, trace-to-trace matching\nis not straightforward and allows the system to produce events in different\norder or even miss some of them.

An approach based on rate-equation\nresults for irreversible aggregation (IA) models is extended to predict several\nscaling regimes in square and triangular lattices, in agreement with simulation\nresults. Consistently with previous works, a regime I with fractal islands is\nobserved at low temperatures, corresponding to IA with critical island size\ni=1, and a crossover to a second regime appears as the temperature is increased\nto \\epsilon R^{2/3} ~ 1, where \\epsilon is the single bond detachment\nprobability and R is the diffusion-to-deposition ratio. In the square\n(triangular) lattice, a regime with scaling similar to IA with i=3 (i=2) is\nobserved after that crossover. In the triangular lattice, a subsequent\ncrossover to an IA regime with i=3 is observed, which is explained by the\nrecurrence properties of random walks in two dimensional lattices, which is\nbeyond the mean-field approaches. At high temperatures, a crossover to a fully\nreversible regime is observed, characterized by a large density of small\nislands, a small density of very large islands, and total island and monomer\ndensities increasing with temperature, in contrast to IA models. CZDs and ISDs\nwith Gaussian right tails appear in all regimes for R ~ 10^7 or larger,\nincluding the fully reversible regime, where the CZDs are bimodal.

The ML techniques proposed here distinguish\nthemselves from traditional halo occupation distribution (HOD) modeling as they\ndo not assume a prescribed relationship between halo properties and N_gal. In\naddition, our ML approaches are only dependent on parent halo properties (like\nHOD methods), which are advantageous over subhalo-based approaches as\nidentifying subhalos correctly is difficult. We test 2 algorithms: support\nvector machines (SVM) and k-nearest-neighbour (kNN) regression. We take\ngalaxies and halos from the Millennium simulation and predict N_gal by training\nour algorithms on the following 6 halo properties: number of particles, M_200,\n\\sigma_v, v_max, half-mass radius and spin. For Millennium, our predicted N_gal\nvalues have a mean-squared-error (MSE) of ~0.16 for both SVM and kNN. Our\npredictions match the overall distribution of halos reasonably well and the\ngalaxy correlation function at large scales to ~5-10%.

The richness N of a group is defined as the number of Me_B <= -18.25\ngalaxies belonging to that group. We split our principal sample into red,\npassive galaxies with NUV - r >= 4.25 and blue, star-forming galaxies with NUV\n- r < 4.25. We find that blue galaxies with a close companion are primarily\nlocated in poor groups, while the red ones are in rich groups. The number of\nclose neighbours per red galaxy increases with N, with n_red being proportional\nto 0.11N, while that of blue galaxies does not depend on N and is roughly\nconstant. In addition, these trends are found to be independent of redshift,\nand only the average n_blue evolves, decreasing with cosmic time. Our results\nsupport the following assembly history of L_B >= L*_B galaxies in the group\nenvironment: red, massive galaxies were formed in or accreted by the dark\nmatter halo of the group at early times (z >= 1), therefore their number of\nneighbours provides a fossil record of the stellar mass assembly of groups,\ntraced by their richness N. On the other hand, blue, less massive galaxies have\nrecently been accreted by the group potential and are still in their parent\ndark matter halo, having the same number of neighbours irrespective of N. As\ntime goes by, these blue galaxies settle in the group potential and turn red\nand/or fainter, thus becoming satellite galaxies in the group.
