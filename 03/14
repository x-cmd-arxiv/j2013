Several different parameterizations have already been suggested, some\nlinked to classifications of theories, and others more empirically motivated.\nHere we describe a particular new approach which casts modifications to gravity\nthrough two free functions of time and scale, which are directly linked to the\nfield equations, but also easy to confront with observational data. We compare\nour approach with other existing methods of parameterizing modied gravity,\nspecifically the parameterized post-Friedmann approach and the older method\nusing the parameter set $\\{\\mu,\\gamma\\}$. We explain the connection between our\nparameters and the physics that is most important for generating cosmic\nmicrowave background anisotropies. Some qualitative features of this new\nparameterization, and therefore modifications to the gravitational equations of\nmotion, are illustrated in a toy model, where the two functions are simply\nassumed to be constant parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Mar 2013 16:01:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 Sep 2013 17:18:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-26"}

The iron\nabundances are derived by a spectrum synthesis modeling of the wavelength\nregion from 4850 to 5375 A, while calcium and carbon abundances are obtained by\nfitting the Ca II H and K lines and the CH G band respectively. A range in\nmetallicity of -2.9 <= [Fe/H]} <= -1.6 is found within the giants sampled, with\na good correlation between [Fe/H] and [Ca/H]. The great majority of stars in\nthe sample would be classified as having weak absorption in the lambda 3883 CN\nband, with only a small scatter in band strengths at a given luminosity on the\nred giant branch. In this sense the behavior of CN among the Draco giants is\nconsistent with the predominantly weak CN bands found among red giants in\nglobular clusters of metallicity [Fe/H] < -1.8. Over half of the giants in the\nDraco sample have [Fe/H] > -2.25, and among these there is a trend for the\n[C/Fe] abundance to decrease with increasing luminosity on the red giant\nbranch. This is a phenomenon that is also seen among both field and globular\ncluster giants of the Galactic halo, where it has been interpreted as a\nconsequence of deep mixing of material between the base of the convective\nenvelope and the outer limits of the hydrogen-burning shell. However, among the\nsix Draco giants observed that turn out to have metallicities -2.65 < [Fe/H] <\n-2.25 there is no such trend seen in the carbon abundance. This may be due to\nsmall sample statistics or primordial inhomogeneities in carbon abundance among\nthe most metal-poor Draco stars. We identify a potential carbon-rich extremely\nmetal-poor star in our sample.

For determining the collision strengths, and subsequently the\nexcitation rates, the Dirac Atomic R-matrix Code ({\\sc darc}) is used.\nOscillator strengths, radiative rates and line strengths are reported for all\nE1, E2, M1 and M2 transitions among the lowest 49 levels of each ion.\nAdditionally, theoretical lifetimes are provided for all 49 levels of the above\nfive ions. Collision strengths are averaged over a Maxwellian velocity\ndistribution and the effective collision strengths obtained listed over a wide\ntemperature range up to 10$^{8}$ K. Comparisons are made with similar data\nobtained using the Flexible Atomic Code ({\\sc fac}) to highlight the importance\nof resonances, included in calculations with {\\sc darc}, in the determination\nof effective collision strengths. Discrepancies between the collision strengths\nfrom {\\sc darc} and {\\sc fac}, particularly for some forbidden transitions, are\nalso discussed. Finally, discrepancies between the present results for\neffective collision strengths with the {\\sc darc} code and earlier\nsemi-relativistic $R$-matrix data are noted over a wide range of electron\ntemperatures for many transitions in all ions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Mar 2013 17:25:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

Moreover, each such representation is obtained\nby restriction of the 45-dimensional irreducible representation of the Mathieu\ngroup M24 constructed by Margolin.

Standard web search is\nby far the most common interface for such information. It is therefore of\ninterest to find out how well web search engines work for diagnostic queries\nand what factors contribute to successes and failures. Among diseases, rare (or\norphan) diseases represent an especially challenging and thus interesting class\nto diagnose as each is rare, diverse in symptoms and usually has scattered\nresources associated with it. Methods: We use an evaluation approach for web\nsearch engines for rare disease diagnosis which includes 56 real life\ndiagnostic cases, state-of-the-art evaluation measures, and curated information\nresources. In addition, we introduce FindZebra, a specialized (vertical) rare\ndisease search engine. FindZebra is powered by open source search technology\nand uses curated freely available online medical information. Results:\nFindZebra outperforms Google Search in both default setup and customised to the\nresources used by FindZebra. We extend FindZebra with specialized\nfunctionalities exploiting medical ontological information and UMLS medical\nconcepts to demonstrate different ways of displaying the retrieved results to\nmedical experts. Conclusions: Our results indicate that a specialized search\nengine can improve the diagnostic quality without compromising the ease of use\nof the currently widely popular web search engines. The proposed evaluation\napproach can be valuable for future development and benchmarking.

For waves,\nhowever, diffusion is an approximation that disregards the possibility of\ninterference. Anderson localization, which manifests itself through a vanishing\ndiffusion coefficient in an infinite system, originates from constructive\ninterference of waves traveling in loop trajectories -- pairs of time-reversed\npaths returning to the same point. In an open system of finite size, the return\nprobability through such paths is reduced, particularly near the boundary where\nwaves may escape. Based on this argument, the self-consistent theory of\nlocalization and the supersymmetric field theory predict that the diffusion\ncoefficient varies spatially inside the system. A direct experimental\nobservation of this effect is a challenge because it requires monitoring wave\ntransport inside the system. Here, we fabricate two-dimensional photonic random\nmedia and probe position-dependent diffusion inside the sample from the third\ndimension. By varying the geometry of the system or the dissipation which also\nlimits the size of loop trajectories, we are able to control the\nrenormalization of the diffusion coefficient.

To provide a theory that is\ncomputable, we focus on a combinatorial version of sheaves and cosheaves called\ncellular sheaves and cosheaves, which are finite families of vector spaces and\nmaps parametrized by a cell complex. We develop cellular (co)sheaves as a new\ntool for topological data analysis, network coding and sensor networks. A\nfoundation for multi-dimensional level-set persistent homology is laid via\nconstructible cosheaves, which are equivalent to representations of\nMacPherson's entrance path category. By proving a van Kampen theorem, we give a\ndirect proof of this equivalence. A cosheaf version of the i'th derived\npushforward of the constant sheaf along a definable map is constructed directly\nas a representation of this category. We go on to clarify the relationship of\ncellular sheaves to cosheaves by providing a formula that defines a derived\nequivalence, which in turn recovers Verdier duality. Compactly-supported sheaf\ncohomology is expressed as the coend with the image of the constant sheaf\nthrough this equivalence. The equivalence is further used to establish\nrelations between sheaf cohomology and a herein newly introduced theory of\ncellular sheaf homology. Inspired to provide fast algorithms for persistence,\nwe prove that the derived category of cellular sheaves over a 1D cell complex\nis equivalent to a category of graded sheaves. Finally, we introduce the\ninterleaving distance as an extended pseudo-metric on the category of sheaves.\nWe prove that global sections partition the space of sheaves into connected\ncomponents. We conclude with an investigation into the geometry of the space of\nconstructible sheaves over the real line, which we relate to the bottleneck\ndistance in persistence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Mar 2013 19:40:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 Dec 2014 19:59:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-18"}

The\nrelease of the differentiability hypothesis has important mathematical\nconsequences, like scale dependence and the use of a higher algebra. The law of\nmechanics transfers directly these properties to the velocity of fluid\nparticles whose trajectories in velocity space become fractal and\nnon-deterministic. The principle of relativity is used to find the form of the\nequation governing velocity in scale space. The solution of this equation\ncontains a fractal and a non-fractal term. The fractal part is shown to be\nequivalent to the Lagrangian version of the Kolmogorov law of fully-developed\nand isotropic turbulence. It is therefore associated with turbulence, whereas\nthe non-fractal deterministic term is associated with a laminar behavior. These\nterms are found to be balanced when the typical velocity reaches a level at\nwhich the Reynolds number is equal to one, in agreement with the empirical\nobservations. The rate of energy dissipated by turbulence in a flow passing an\nobstacle that was only known from experiments can be derived theoretically from\nthe equation's solution. Finally, a quantum-like equation in velocity space is\nproposed in order to find the probability of having a given velocity at a given\nlocation.

Its discoverers proposed that these \"sunquakes\" are the signature\nof a shock driven by \"thick-target heating\" of the flaring chromosphere.\nH-{\\alpha} observations show evidence for such a shock. However, simulations of\nshocks driven by impulsive chromospheric heating show withering radiative\nlosses as the shock proceeds downward. The compression of the shocked gas heats\nand increases its density, making it more radiative. So, radiative losses\nincrease radically with the strength of the shock. This has introduced doubt\nthat sufficient energy from such a shock can penetrate into the solar interior\nto match that indicated by the helioseismic signatures. We point out that\nsimulations of acoustic transients driven by impulsive heating have no account\nfor magnetic fields characteristic of transient-seismic-source environments.\nThese must have a major impact on the seismic flux conducted into the solar\ninterior. A strong horizontal magnetic field, for example, greatly increases\nthe compressional modulus of the chromospheric medium. This greatly reduces\ncompression of the gas, hence the radiative losses as the transient passes\nthrough it. This could explain the strong affinity of seismic sources to\nregions of strong, highly inclined penumbral magnetic fields. The role of\ninclined magnetic fields, then, is fundamental to our understanding of the role\nof impulsive heating in transient seismic emission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Mar 2013 21:42:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

As a result, the fluorescence and the surface array techniques are more\nmature today, providing more reliable measurements of the primary cosmic\nparticle energy, chemical composition and the inelastic cross-section. The\nadvantages of the radio technique are 100 percent duty cycle and lower\ndeployment and operational costs. Thus, the radio technique can greatly\ncomplement the fluorescence and the ground array detection and can also work\nindependently. With the ANITA balloon detector observing UHECRs and the success\nof LOPES, CODALEMA and other surface radio detectors, the radio technique\nreceived a significant boost in recent years. Reliable Monte Carlo (MC)\nsimulations are needed in order to obtain the energy and other parameters of\nthe primary cosmic ray particle from the radio observations. Several MC\ntechniques, like ZHairesS and the Endpoint Formalism, were proposed in recent\nyears. While they seem to reproduce some of the observed data quite well, there\nis a divergence between the different approaches under certain conditions. In\nthis work we derive these approaches from Maxwells equations and prove their\nidentity under certain conditions as well as discuss their applicability to the\nUHECR air showers and to a proposed experiment at SLAC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Mar 2013 23:33:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

Many methods for the judgement of attribute characters are based on the\nrelationship between the objects and attributes. In this paper, a new type of\njudgement theorems which are absolutely based on the relationship among\nattributes is proposed for the judgement of attribute characters. The method is\nthrough comparing the two new attribute sets $E(a)$ and $N(a)$ with respect to\nthe designated attribute $a$ which is proposed in this paper. We conclude that\nwhich type of the attribute $a$ belongs to is determined by the relationship\nbetween $E(a)$ and $N(a)$ in essence. Secondly, more concise and clear results\nare given about the judgment of the attribute characters through analyzing the\nproperties of refinement and precise-refinement between $E(a)$ and $N(a)$ in\ntopology. In addition, the relationship among attributes are discussed which is\nuseful for constructing a reduct in the last section of this paper.

We report\nanalysis of an M7.7 flare on 2012 July 19 observed by SDO/AIA and RHESSI.\nBi-directional outflows in forms of plasmoid ejections and contracting\ncusp-shaped loops originate between an erupting flux rope and underlying flare\nloops at speeds of typically 200-300 km/s up to 1050 km/s. These outflows are\nassociated with spatially separated double coronal X-ray sources with centroid\nseparation decreasing with energy. The highest temperature is located near the\nnonthermal X-ray loop-top source well below the original heights of contracting\ncusps near the inferred reconnection site. These observations suggest that the\nprimary loci of particle acceleration and plasma heating are in the\nreconnection outflow regions, rather than the reconnection site itself. In\naddition, there is an initial ascent of the X-ray and EUV loop-top source prior\nto its recently recognized descent, which we ascribe to the interplay among\nmultiple processes including the upward development of reconnection and the\ndownward contractions of reconnected loops. The impulsive phase onset is\ndelayed by 10 minutes from the start of the descent, but coincides with the\nrapid speed increases of the upward plasmoids, the individual loop shrinkages,\nand the overall loop-top descent, suggestive of an intimate relation of the\nenergy release rate and reconnection outflow speed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Mar 2013 00:43:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-04"}

Cooler dusty gas naturally accumulates in the cores of elliptical\ngalaxies due to dust-cooled local stellar mass loss and may accrete onto the\ncentral black hole, releasing energy. AGN-heated gas can transport dust in\ncores 5-10 kpc out into the hot gas atmospheres where it radiates extended 70\nmicron emission but is eventually destroyed by sputtering. This, and some\nmodest star formation, defines a cycle of dust creation and destruction.\nElliptical galaxies evidently undergo large transient excursions in the banana\nplot in times comparable to the sputtering time or AGN duty cycle, 10 Myrs.\nNormally regarded as passive, elliptical galaxies are the most active galaxies\nin the IR color-color correlation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Mar 2013 05:55:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

Thus, static compression of porous dust\naggregates is important in planetesimal formation. However, the static\ncompression strength has been investigated only for relatively high density\naggregates (\\phi > 0.1). Aims: We investigate and find the compression strength\nof highly porous aggregates (\\phi << 1). Methods: We perform three dimensional\nN-body simulations of aggregate compression with a particle-particle\ninteraction model. We introduce a new method of static compression: the\nperiodic boundary condition is adopted and the boundaries move with low speed\nto get closer. The dust aggregate is compressed uniformly and isotropically by\nthemselves over the periodic boundaries.

Under\nsome mild assumptions, we establish a result that provides sufficient\nconditions for adaptive contraction rates in a range of models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Mar 2013 07:20:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-15"}

Asteroseismic determinations of structural parameters of hot B\nsubdwarfs (sdB) have been carried out for more than a decade now. These\nanalyses rely on stellar models whose reliability for the required task needs\nto be evaluated critically. Aims. We present new models of the so-called third\ngeneration (3G) dedicated to the asteroseismology of sdB stars. These\nparameterized models are complete static structures suitable for analyzing both\np- and g-mode pulsators, contrary to the former second generation (2G) models\nthat were limited to p-modes. While the reliability of the 2G models has been\nsuccessfully verified in the past, this important test still has to be\nconducted on the 3G structures. Methods. The close eclipsing binary PG 1336-018\nprovides a unique opportunity to test the reliability of sdB models. We\ncompared the structural parameters of the sdB component in PG 1336-018 obtained\nfrom asteroseismology based on the 3G models, with those derived independently\nfrom the modeling of the reflection/irradiation effect and the eclipses\nobserved in the light curve. Results. The stellar parameters inferred from\nasteroseismology using the 3G models are found to be remarkably consistent with\nboth the preferred orbital solution obtained from the binary light curve\nmodeling and the updated spectroscopic estimates for the surface gravity of the\nstar. We also show that the uncertainties on the input physics included in\nstellar models have no noticeable impact, at the current level of accuracy, on\nthe structural parameters derived by asteroseismology. Conclusions. The stellar\nmodels presently used to carry out quantitative seismic analyses of sdB stars\nare reliable for the task. The stellar parameters inferred by this technique,\nat least for those that could be tested (M*, R*, and log g), appear to be both\nvery precise and accurate, as no significant systematic effect has been found.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Mar 2013 07:38:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

Filling this gap in our\nunderstanding has new urgency because DNA nanotechnology often depends\ncritically on binding rates. Here we use a coarse-grained model to explore the\nhybridization kinetics of DNA oligomers, finding that strand association\nproceeds through a complex set of intermediate states. Successful binding\nevents start with the formation of a few metastable base-pairing interactions,\nfollowed by zippering of the remaining bonds. However, despite reasonably\nstrong interstrand interactions, initial contacts frequently fail to lead to\nzippering because the typical configurations in which they form differ from\ntypical states of similar enthalpy in the double-stranded equilibrium ensemble.\nTherefore, if the association process is analyzed on the base-pair (secondary\nstructure) level, it shows non-Markovian behavior. Initial contacts must be\nstabilized by two or three base pairs before full zippering is likely,\nresulting in negative effective activation enthalpies. Non-Arrhenius behavior\nis observed as the number of base pairs in the effective transition state\nincreases with temperature. In addition, we find that alternative pathways\ninvolving misbonds can increase association rates. For repetitive sequences,\nmisaligned duplexes frequently rearrange to form fully paired duplexes by two\ndistinct processes which we label `pseudoknot' and `inchworm' internal\ndisplacement. We show how the above processes can explain why experimentally\nobserved association rates of GC-rich oligomers are higher than rates of\nAT-rich equivalents. More generally, we argue that association rates can be\nmodulated by sequence choice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Mar 2013 08:01:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-28"}

Critical current density measurements and\npinning force distributions independently yield a mean distance between\neffective pinning centers $\\bar{\\mathcal L} \\sim 90$ nm, increasing with\nincreasing P-content $x$. This evolution can be understood as being the\nconsequence of the P-dependence of the London penetration depth. Further\nsalient features are a wide vortex free \"Meissner belt\", observed at the edge\nof overdoped crystals, and characteristic chain-like vortex arrangements,\nobserved at all levels of P-substitution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Mar 2013 09:15:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-15"}

With the increasing interest in post-GWAS research which\nrepresents a transition from genome-wide association discovery to analysis of\nfunctional mechanisms, attention has been lately focused on the potential of\nincluding various biological material in epidemiological studies.

We show that the less massive giant stars with planets (M < 1.5 Msun)\nare not metal rich, but, the metallicity of the sample of massive (M > 1.5\nMsun), young (age < 2 Gyr) giant stars with planets is higher than that of a\nsimilar sample of stars without planets. Regarding other chemical elements,\ngiant stars with and without planets in the mass domain M < 1.5 Msun show\nsimilar abundance patterns. However, planet and non-planet hosts with masses M\n> 1.5 Msun show differences in the abundances of some elements, specially Na,\nCo, and Ni. In addition, we find the sample of subgiant stars with planets to\nbe metal rich showing similar metallicities to main-sequence planet hosts. The\nfact that giant planet hosts in the mass domain M < 1.5 Msun do not show\nmetal-enrichment is difficult to explain. Given that these stars have similar\nstellar parameters to subgiants and main-sequence planet hosts, the lack of the\nmetal-rich signature in low-mass giants could be explained if originated from a\npollution scenario in the main sequence that gets erased as the star become\nfully convective. However, there is no physical reason why it should play a\nrole for giants with masses M < 1.5 Msun but is not observed for giants with M\n> 1.5 Msun.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Mar 2013 11:49:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

On\nthe other hand, quantum theory also predicts that environmental coupling\nproduces the opposite effect of spreading the wave function into a mixed state.\nStudying the effect of these two competing processes, as the ratio of their\nstrengths is varied, on the distribution of a quantum state is of fundamental\ninterest in any setting, but especially so in the mechanical realm. A key\nissue, however, is that a fundamental study of such physics can not entail an a\npriori assumption of the projection postulate itself, and Bayesian inference\nmay therefore not be employed to observe the quantum state. In this theoretical\nwork we propose a feasible way to perform such a fundamental test with a\nmechanical wave function in the energy eigenbasis. The scheme is based on an\noptomechanical setup wherein optical fields provide a direct probe of the\nenergy variance of the mechanical wave function. Such an energy variance probe\nis unprecedented in any type of system. Numerical simulations that incorporate\nthe projection postulate predict a monotonic decrease in the time-averaged\nenergy variance as the ratio of continuous measurement strength to dissipation\nis increased. The measurement strength in the proposed scheme is tunable in\nsitu, and the behavior predicted by the simulations therefore implies that the\nscheme amounts to a way to verifiably control in situ the time-averaged\nvariance of a mechanical wave function over the course of a single quantum\ntrajectory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Mar 2013 13:46:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 Mar 2013 15:24:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 3 Jul 2013 00:43:09 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 14 Nov 2013 05:34:02 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 2 Jan 2014 03:46:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-03"}

We propose a general framework to analyze the role of different\nionic currents and their interactions in shaping the properties of impedance\namplitude and phase in linearized biophysical models and demonstrate this\napproach in a two-dimensional linear model with two effective conductances gL\nand g1. We compute the key attributes of impedance and phase (resonance\nfrequency and amplitude, zero-phase frequency, selectivity, etc.) in the gL-g1\nparameter space. Using these attribute diagrams we identify two basic\nmechanisms for the generation of resonance: an increase in the resonance\namplitude as g1 increases while the overall impedance is decreased, and an\nincrease in the maximal impedance, without any change in the input resistance,\nas the ionic current time constant increases.

The function $f_K$ measures the\naverage taxicab distance of the points in the plane from the focal set $K$ by\nintegration. The main area of the applications is the geometric tomography\nbecause $f_K$ involves the coordinate X-rays' information as second order\npartial derivatives \\cite{NV3}. We prove that the Hausdorff-convergence implies\nthe convergence of the conic functions with respect to both the supremum-norm\nand the $L_1$-norm provided that we restrict the domain to the collection of\nnon-empty compact connected hv-convex planar sets contained in a fixed box\n(reference set) with parallel sides to the coordinate axes. We also have that\n$\\Phi^{-1}$ is upper semi-continuous as a set-valued mapping. The upper\nsemi-continuity establishes an approximating process in the sense that if $f_L$\nis close to $f_K$ then $L$ must be close to an element $K'$ such that\n$f_{K}=f_{K'}$. Therefore $K$ and $K'$ have the same coordinate X-rays almost\neverywhere. Lower semi-continuity is usually related to the existence of\ncontinuous selections. If a set-valued mapping is both upper and lower\nsemi-continuous at a point of its domain it is called continuous. The last\nsection of the paper is devoted to the case of non-empty compact convex planar\nsets. We show that the class of convex bodies that are determined by their\ncoordinate X-rays coincides with the family of convex bodies $K$ for which\n$f_K$ is a point of lower semi-continuity for $\\Phi^{-1}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Mar 2013 10:29:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 Jul 2013 07:43:38 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 20 Dec 2013 08:40:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-23"}
