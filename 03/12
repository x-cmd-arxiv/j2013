Its input consists of segments, and each one is\nassigned the class which minimizes a stochastic distance. Assuming the complex\nWishart model, several stochastic distances are obtained from the h-phi family\nof divergences, and they are employed to derive hypothesis test statistics that\nare also used in the classification process. This article also presents, as a\nnovelty, analytic expressions for the test statistics based on the following\nstochastic distances between complex Wishart models: Kullback-Leibler,\nBhattacharyya, Hellinger, R\\'enyi, and Chi-Square; also, the test statistic\nbased on the Bhattacharyya distance between multivariate Gaussian distributions\nis presented. The classifier performance is evaluated using simulated and real\nPolSAR data. The simulated data are based on the complex Wishart model, aiming\nat the analysis of the proposal well controlled data. The real data refer to\nthe complex L-band image, acquired during the 1994 SIR-C mission. The results\nof the proposed classifier are compared with those obtained by a Wishart\nper-pixel/contextual classifier, and we show the better performance of the\nregion-based classification. The influence of the statistical modeling is\nassessed by comparing the results using the Bhattacharyya distance between\nmultivariate Gaussian distributions for amplitude data. The results with\nsimulated data indicate that the proposed classification method has a very good\nperformance when the data follow the Wishart model. The proposed classifier\nalso performs better than the per-pixel/contextual classifier and the\nBhattacharyya Gaussian distance using SIR-C PolSAR data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Mar 2013 18:39:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-15"}

Instead\nof extending the canonical Solid-Face-Edge-Vertex schema by, say, \"hypersolids\"\nthese classes are generalised to a common type SpatialEntity, and the\nindividual BoundedBy relations between two consecutive classes are generalised\nto one BoundedBy relation on SpatialEntity instances. Then the pair\n(SpatialEntity, BoundedBy) is a so-called incidence graph.\n  The novelty about this approach uses the observation that an incidence graph\nrepresents a topological space of SpatialEntity instances because the\nBoundedBy-relation defines a so-called Alexandrov topology for them turning\nthem into a topological space. So spatial data becomes part of mathematical\ntopology and topology can be immediately applied to spatial data. For example,\ncontinuous functions between two instances of spatial data allow the consistent\nmodelling of generalisation. Further, it is also possible to establish a formal\ntopological definition of spatial data dimension, and every topological data\nmodel of arbitrary dimension gets a simple uniform data model. This model\ncovers space-time, and the version history of a spatial model can be\nrepresented by an Alexandrov topology, too. By integrating space, time,\nversion, and scale into one single schema, topological queries across those\naspects are enabled through topological constructions. In fact, the topological\nconstructions cover a relationally complete query language for spaces and can\nbe redefined to operate accordingly on their graph representations.\n  With these observations a relational database schema for a spatial data model\nof dimension 6 and more is developed. The schema seamlessly integrates 4D\nspace-time, levels of detail and version history, and it can be easily expanded\nto also contain non-spatial information or be linked to other data sources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Mar 2013 17:46:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-12"}

We focus on the study of the reduced 3PCF, Q, defined as the\nratio between the 3PCF and the sum of the products of the 2PCFs. We find a very\nweak stellar mass dependence of Q in both redshift and projected spaces. On\nsmall scales, more massive galaxies tend to have slightly higher amplitudes of\nQ. The shape dependence of Q is also weak on these small scales, regardless of\nstellar mass and color. The reduced 3PCF has a strong color dependence for the\nlow-mass galaxies, while no significant dependence on color is found for the\nhigh-mass galaxies. Low-mass red galaxies have higher amplitudes and stronger\nshape dependence of the reduced 3PCF than the blue galaxies, implying that\nthese low-mass red galaxies tend to populate filamentary structures.

A supersymmetric supergravity solution exists when Q=N-l(l-k)/2k-k/24 is\npositive and is interpretable as a RG flow from a Yang-Mills like UV fixed\npoint to a superconformal IR fixed point with free energy of order Q^3/2.

We explore the\nstructure of the possible gravity solution for small negative Q by considering\nthe linearized gravitational back reaction from adding a small number of\nanti-branes on the Q=0 background. Following the work of Bena, et.al., we find\nthat a sensible solution satisfying appropriate boundary conditions does not\nappear to exist. This leaves the status of the RG flow for the Q<0 theories a\nmystery. We offer the following speculative resolution to the puzzle: the -k/24\nunit of charge induced by the curvature correction to supergravity should be\nconsidered an allowed physical object, and one should be adding an anti brane\nnot to the Q=0 background but rather the Q=-k/24 background. Such a solution\nhas a repulson singularity, and gives rise to a picture of the vacuum\nconfiguration where a cluster of anti-branes are floating around the repulson\nsingularity, but are stabilized from being pushed off to infinity by other\nfluxes. Such a state is non-supersymmetric and appears to describe a vacuum\nwith dynamical breaking of supersymmetry.

The proposed dynamic is a generalization of the discrete replicator\ndynamic. The replicator dynamic has been successfully used to extract dense\nclusters of graphs; however, it is often sensitive to the degree distribution\nof a graph, and usually biased by vertices with large degrees, thus may fail to\ndetect the densest cluster. To overcome this problem, we introduce a dynamic\nparameter, called path parameter, into the evolution process. The path\nparameter can be interpreted as the maximal possible probability of a current\ncluster containing a vertex, and it monotonically increases as evolution\nprocess proceeds. By limiting the maximal probability, the phenomenon of some\nvertices dominating the early stage of evolution process is suppressed, thus\nmaking evolution process more robust. To solve the optimization problem with a\nfixed path parameter, we propose an efficient fixed point algorithm. The time\ncomplexity of the path following replicator dynamic is only linear in the\nnumber of edges of a graph, thus it can analyze graphs with millions of\nvertices and tens of millions of edges on a common PC in a few minutes.\nBesides, it can be naturally generalized to hypergraph and graph with edges of\ndifferent orders. We apply it to four important problems: maximum clique\nproblem, densest k-subgraph problem, structure fitting, and discovery of\nhigh-density regions. The extensive experimental results clearly demonstrate\nits advantages, in terms of robustness, scalability and flexility.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Mar 2013 19:52:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-12"}

Since the experimental\nsensitivity for $BR(\\mu\\to e,3e)$ is expected to increase by five orders of\nmagnitude within the next decade, it is shown that the RS-A$_4$ lepton sector\ncan be significantly constrained.

Furthermore, terrestrial planets in the habitable\nzones (HZs) around M-dwarfs can potentially be characterized in the near future\nand hence may be the first such planets to be studied. Recently Dressing &\nCharbonneau(2013) used Kepler data and calculated the frequency of terrestrial\nplanets in the HZ of cool stars to be 0.15^{+0.13}_{-0.06} per star for\nEarth-size planets (0.5-1.4 R_{Earth}). However, this estimate was derived\nusing the Kasting et al.(1993) HZ limits, which were not valid for stars with\neffective temperatures lower than 3700 K. Here we update their result using new\nHZ limits from Kopparapu et al.(2013) for stars with effective temperatures\nbetween 2600 K and 7200 K, which includes the cool M stars in the Kepler target\nlist. The new habitable zone boundaries increase the number of planet\ncandidates in the habitable zone. Assuming Earth-size planets as 0.5 - 1.4\nR_{Earth}, when we reanalyze their results, we obtain a terrestrial planet\nfrequency of 0.48^{+0.12}_{-0.24} and 0.53^{+0.08}_{-0.17} planets per M-dwarf\nstar for conservative and optimistic limits of the HZ boundaries, respectively.\nAssuming Earth-size planets as 0.5 - 2 R_{Earth}, the frequency increases to\n0.51^{+0.10}_{-0.20} per star for the conservative estimate and to\n0.61^{+0.07}_{-0.15} per star for the optimistic estimate. Within\nuncertainties, our optimistic estimates are in agreement with a similar\noptimistic estimate from the radial velocity survey of M-dwarfs\n(0.41^{+0.54}_{-0.13}, Bonfils et al.(2011)). So, the potential for finding\nEarth-like planets around M stars may be higher than previously reported.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Mar 2013 19:58:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

We argue that the threshold\nsurface density of supernovae rate for seeding a wind depends on the ability of\nsuperbubble energetics to compensate for radiative cooling. We first adapt\nKompaneets formalism for expanding bubbles in a stratified medium to the case\nof continuous energy injection and include the effects of radiative cooling in\nthe shell. With the help of hydrodynamic simulations, we then study the\nevolution of superbubbles evolving in stratified disks with typical disk\nparameters. We identify two crucial energy injection rates that differ in their\neffects, the corresponding breakout ranging from being gentle to a vigorous\none. (a) Superbubbles that break out of the disk with a Mach number of order\n2-3 correspond to an energy injection rate of order 10^{-4} erg cm^{-2} s^{-1},\nwhich is relevant for disk galaxies with synchrotron emitting gas in the\nextra-planar regions. (b) A larger energy injection threshold, of order 10^{-3}\nerg cm^{-2} s^{-1}, or equivalently, a star formation surface density of \\sim\n0.1 solar mass yr^{-1} kpc^{-2}, corresponds to superbubbles with a Mach number\n\\sim 5-10. While the milder superbubbles can be produced by large OB\nassociations, the latter kind requires super-starclusters. These derived\nconditions compare well with observations of disk galaxies with winds and the\nexistence of multiphase halo gas. Furthermore, we find that contrary to the\ngeneral belief that superbubbles fragment through Rayleigh-Taylor (RT)\ninstability when they reach a vertical height of order the scale height, the\nsuperbubbles are first affected by thermal instability for typical disk\nparameters and that RT instability takes over when the shells reach a distance\nof approximately twice the scale height.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Mar 2013 20:00:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 13 Jul 2013 09:13:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

Here we analyze the principles of security in\ndifferent domains and demonstrate an architectural flaw in current\ncybersecurity. Cybersecurity is inherently weak because it is missing the\nability to defend the overall system instead of individual computers. The\ncurrent architecture enables all nodes in the computer network to communicate\ntransparently with one another, so security would require protecting every\ncomputer in the network from all possible attacks. In contrast, other systems\ndepend on system-wide protections. In providing conventional security, police\npatrol neighborhoods and the military secures borders, rather than defending\neach individual household. Likewise, in biology, the immune system provides\nsecurity against viruses and bacteria using primarily action at the skin,\nmembranes, and blood, rather than requiring each cell to defend itself. We\npropose applying these same principles to address the cybersecurity challenge.\nThis will require: (a) Enabling pervasive distribution of self-propagating\nsecurityware and creating a developer community for such securityware, and (b)\nModifying the protocols of internet routers to accommodate adaptive security\nsoftware that would regulate internet traffic. The analysis of the immune\nsystem architecture provides many other principles that should be applied to\ncybersecurity. Among these principles is a careful interplay of detection and\naction that includes evolutionary improvement. However, achieving significant\nsecurity gains by applying these principles depends strongly on remedying the\nunderlying architectural limitations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Mar 2013 20:47:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-13"}

A promising approach to test progenitor models of SNe Ia is to search\nfor the companion in SNRs. Here we present the results of 3D hydrodynamics\nsimulations of the interaction between the SN Ia blast wave and a MS companion\ntaking into consideration its orbital motion and spin. The primary goal of this\nwork is to investigate the rotation of surviving companions after SN Ia\nexplosions in the WD+MS scenario. We use Eggleton's code including the\noptically thick accretion wind model to obtain realistic models of companions.\nThe impact of the SN blast wave on these companions is followed in 3D\nhydrodynamic simulations employing the SPH code GADGET3. We find that the\nrotation of the companion does not significantly affect the amount of stripped\nmass and the kick velocity caused by the SN impact. However, in our\nsimulations, the rotational velocity of the companion is significantly reduced\nto about 14% to 32% of its pre-explosion value due to the expansion of the\ncompanion and the fact that 55%-89% of the initial angular momentum is carried\naway by the stripped matter. Compared with the observed rotational velocity of\nthe presumed companion star of Tycho's SN, Tycho G, of 6 km/s the final\nrotational velocity we obtain is still higher by at least a factor of two.\nWhether this difference is significant, and may cast doubts on the suggestion\nthat Tycho G is the companion of SN 1572, has to be investigated in future\nstudies.

More\nmassive and richer groups show stronger BSG alignment. The BSG alignment around\nblue BCGs is slightly stronger than that around red BCGs. And red BSGs have\nmuch stronger major-axis alignment than blue BSGs. Unlike BSGs, other\nsatellites do not show very significant alignment with group major axis. We\nfurther explore the BSG alignment in semi-analytic model (SAM) constructed by\nGuo et al. (2011). We found general good agreement with observations: BSGs in\nSAM show strong major-axis alignment which depends on group mass and richness\nin the same way as observations; and none of other satellites exhibit prominent\nalignment. However, discrepancy also exists in that the SAM shows opposite BSG\ncolor dependence, which is most probably induced by the missing of large scale\nenvironment ingredient in SAM. The combination of two popular scenarios can\nexplain the detected BSG alignment. The first one: satellites merged into the\ngroup preferentially along the surrounding filaments, which is strongly aligned\nwith the major axis of the group.

Based\non this result, we are able to greatly reduce the number of variables in the\npseudo-covariance optimization problem and thereby develop an efficient\nsolution by applying the celebrated semidefinite relaxation (SDR) technique.\nFinally, we extend the result to the Gaussian MISO broadcast channel (MISO-BC)\nwith improper Gaussian signaling or so-called widely linear transmit precoding.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Mar 2013 03:11:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 6 Oct 2013 06:22:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 9 Oct 2013 07:08:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-10"}

The time/distance required for\nthe shock formation is shorter for a more impulsive source-region expansion.\nAfter the piston stops, the wave amplitude and phase-speed start decreasing.\nDuring the expansion, most of the source region becomes strongly rarified,\nwhich reproduces the coronal dimming left behind the eruption.

The two effects\nhave not been considered simultaneously in the literature, however, each one of\nthese has been considered separately and deduced the picture by simply\nsuperposing them, but such an approach can lead to spurious results. Hence by\nconsidering pulsar rotation and PC--current perturbations together instead of\none at a time we have developed a single particle curvature radiation model,\nwhich is expected to be much more realistic. By simulating a set of typical\npulse profiles we have made an attempt to explain most of the observational\nresults on pulsar radio emission and polarization. The model predicts that due\nto the perturbations leading side component can become either stronger or\nweaker than the corresponding trailing one in any given cone depending on the\npassage of sight line and modulation (nonuniform source distribution). Further\nwe find that the phase delay of polarization angle inflection point with\nrespect to the core component greatly depends upon the viewing geometry. The\ncorrelation between the sign reversal of circular polarization and the\npolarization angle swing in the case of core dominated pulsars become obscure\nonce the perturbations and modulation become significant. However the\ncorrelation that the negative circular polarization associates with the\nincreasing polarization angle and vice versa shows up very clearly in the case\nof conal-double pulsars. The `kinky' type distortions in polarization angle\nswing could be due to the incoherent superposition of modulated emissions in\nthe presence of strong perturbations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Mar 2013 06:45:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

Biological light harvesting complexes (LHCs) prevent\nrecombination via the use of cascade structures, which lead to spatial\nseparation of charge-carriers1. In contrast, the nanoscale morphology and high\ncharge densities in organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs) give a high rate of\nelectron-hole encounters, which should result in the formation of spin triplet\nexcitons, as in organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs)2. OPVs would have poor\nquantum efficiencies if every encounter lead to recombination, but\nstate-of-the-art OPVs demonstrate near-unity quantum efficiency3. Here we show\nthat this suppression of recombination can be engineered through the interplay\nbetween spin, energetics and delocalisation of electronic excitations in\norganic semiconductors. We use time-resolved spectroscopy to study a series of\nmodel, high efficiency polymer-fullerene systems in which the lowest lying\nmolecular triplet exciton (T1) (on the polymer) lies below the intermolecular\ncharge transfer state (CT). We observe the formation of T1 states following\nbimolecular recombination, indicating that encounters of spin-uncorrelated\nelectrons and holes generate CT states with both spin singlet (1CT) and spin\ntriplet (3CT) characters. We show that triplet exciton formation can be the\nmajor loss mechanism in OPVs. However, we find that even when energetically\nfavoured, the relaxation of 3CT to T1 can be strongly suppressed, via control\nover wavefunction delocalisation, allowing for the dissociation of 3CT back to\nfree changes, thereby reducing recombination and enhancing device performance.\nOur results point towards new design rules for artificial photo-conversion\nsystems, enabling the suppression of electron-hole recombination, and also for\nOLEDs, avoiding the formation of triplet states and enhancing fluorescence\nefficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Mar 2013 10:03:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-13"}

In this context, model complexity is often\nunknown so that a model order selection step is needed to suitably trade-off\nbias and variance. Recently, a different approach to linear system\nidentification has been introduced, where model order determination is avoided\nby using a regularized least squares framework. In particular, the penalty term\non the impulse response is defined by so called stable spline kernels. They\nembed information on regularity and BIBO stability, and depend on a small\nnumber of parameters which can be estimated from data. In this paper, we\nprovide new nonsmooth formulations of the stable spline estimator. In\nparticular, we consider linear system identification problems in a very broad\ncontext, where regularization functionals and data misfits can come from a rich\nset of piecewise linear quadratic functions. Moreover, our anal- ysis includes\npolyhedral inequality constraints on the unknown impulse response. For any\nformulation in this class, we show that interior point methods can be used to\nsolve the system identification problem, with complexity O(n3)+O(mn2) in each\niteration, where n and m are the number of impulse response coefficients and\nmeasurements, respectively. The usefulness of the framework is illustrated via\na numerical experiment where output measurements are contaminated by outliers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Mar 2013 10:31:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-13"}

In the 1960s, Kochen and Specker\n(who first studied these theories) constructed an elegant psi-epistemic theory\nfor Hilbert space dimension d=2, but also showed that any deterministic\npsi-epistemic theory must be \"measurement contextual\" in dimensions 3 and\nhigher. Last year, the topic attracted renewed attention, when Pusey, Barrett,\nand Rudolph (PBR) showed that any psi-epistemic theory must \"behave badly under\ntensor product.\" In this paper, we prove that even without the Kochen-Specker\nor PBR assumptions, there are no psi-epistemic theories in dimensions d>=3 that\nsatisfy two reasonable conditions: (1) symmetry under unitary transformations,\nand (2) \"maximum nontriviality\" (meaning that the probability distributions\ncorresponding to any two non-orthogonal states overlap). This no-go theorem\nholds if the ontic space is either the set of quantum states or the set of\nunitaries. The proof of this result, in the general case, uses some measure\ntheory and differential geometry.

Our setting is based on a quasi-one-dimensional binary\nBose-Einstein condensate (BEC), composed of two immiscible components with\nlarge and small numbers of atoms in them. Assuming that the \"small\" component\nmoves with constant velocity, either by itself, or being dragged by a moving\ntrap, and intrudes into the \"large\" counterpart, the following results are\nobtained. Depending on the velocity, and on whether the small component moves\nin the absence or in the presence of the trap, two-component dark-bright\nsolitons, scalar dark solitons, or multiple dark solitons may emerge, the\nlatter outcome taking place due to breakdown of the superfluidity. We present\ntwo sets of analytical results to describe this phenomenology. In an\nintermediate velocity regime, where dark-bright solitons form, a reduction of\nthe two-component Gross-Pitaevskii system to an integrable Mel'nikov system is\ndeveloped, demonstrating that solitary waves of the former are very accurately\ndescribed by analytically available solitons of the latter. In the\nhigh-velocity regime, where the breakdown of the superfluidity induces the\nformation of dark solitons and multi-soliton trains, an effective\nsingle-component description, in which a strongly localized wave packet of the\n\"small\" component acts as an effective potential for the \"large\" one, allows us\nto estimate the critical velocity beyond which the coherent structures emerge\nin good agreement with the numerical results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Mar 2013 11:25:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

Studying the mean properties of late-type galaxies in the Local\nSupercluster, we find that galaxies in increasing local galaxy density\nconditions (or decreasing projected angular separation from M87) show a\nsignificant decrease in the HI content and in the mean specific star formation\nrate, along with a progressive reddening of their stellar populations. The\ngradual quenching of the star formation occurs outside-in, consistently with\nthe predictions of the ram pressure model. Once considered as a whole, the\nVirgo cluster is effective in removing neutral hydrogen from galaxies, and this\nperturbation is strong enough to appreciably reduce the SFR of its entire\ngalaxy population.

Recently, the\ndifferences between semiclassical and quantum-electrodynamical (QED) theory of\nlight-matter interaction for scattering of ultrashort x-ray pulses from the\nelectronic wavepacket were formally demonstrated and visually illustrated by\nscattering patterns calculated for an electronic wavepacket in atomic hydrogen\n[Proc.

In a many-electron system, the role of scattering interference\nbetween a non-stationary and several stationary electrons to the total\nscattering signal is investigated. In general, QED and semiclassical theory\nprovide different results for the contribution from the scattering\ninterference, which depends on the energy resolution of the detector and the\nx-ray pulse duration. The present findings are demonstrated by means of a\nnumerical example of x-ray TRI for an electronic wavepacket in helium. It is\nshown that the time-dependent scattering interference vanishes within\nsemiclassical theory and the corresponding patterns are dominated by the\nscattering contribution from the time-independent interference, whereas the\ntime-dependent scattering interference contribution does not vanish in the QED\ntheory and the patterns are dominated by the scattering contribution from the\nnon-stationary electron scattering.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Mar 2013 13:17:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

We apply this strategy to the low-energy\nmodel, derived from the first-principles calculations, and combine it with the\nBerry-phase theory of electric polarization. We start with the simplest\ntwo-orbital model, describing the behavior of the eg bands, and apply it to the\nE-type antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase, which in the DE limit effectively breaks\nup into one-dimensional zigzag chains. We derive an analytical expression for\nthe electronic polarization (Pel) and explain how it depends on the orbital\nordering and the energy splitting Delta between eg states. Then, we evaluate\nparameters of this model, starting from a more general five-orbital model for\nall Mn 3d bands and constructing a new downfolded model for the eg bands. From\nthe analysis of these parameters, we conclude that the behavior of Pel in\nrealistic manganites corresponds to the limit of large Delta. We further\nutilize this property in order to derive an analytical expression for Pel in a\ngeneral two-fold periodic magnetic texture, based on the five-orbital model and\nthe perturbation-theory expansion for the Wannier functions in the first order\nof 1/Delta. This expression explains the functional dependence of Pel on the\nrelative directions of spins. Furthermore, it suggests that Pel is related to\nthe asymmetry of the transfer integrals, which should simultaneously have\nsymmetric and antisymmetric components. Finally, we explain how the\npolarization can be switched between orthorhombic directions a and c by\ninverting the zigzag AFM texture in every second ab plane.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Mar 2013 14:06:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-02"}

This rends a theoretical support to the previous\n(phenomenologically) observed correlation between the dropping nucleon mass and\nthe behavior of the \\omega-nuclear interactions in dense matter described in\nterms of half skyrmions that appear at a density denoted $n_{1/2}$ in skyrmion\ncrystals. The role of the \\omega-meson degree of freedom in the source for\nnucleon mass observed in this paper is highly reminiscent of its important role\nin the skyrmion description of nucleon mass in hidden local symmetric theory.\nOne of the most notable novel results found in this paper is that the nucleon\nmass in dense baryonic medium undergoes a drop roughly linear in density up to\na density (denoted $\\tilde{n}$) slightly above nuclear matter density ($n_0$)\nand then stays more or less constant up to the dilaton limit fixed point. The\npossibility that we entertain is that $\\tilde{n}$ coincides with or at least\nclose to $n_{1/2}$. We note that this feature can be economically captured by\nthe parity-doublet model for nucleons with the chiral-invariant mass $m_0\\sim\n(0.7-0.8) m_N$. It is found in one-loop renormalization-group analysis with the\nLagrangian adopted that while the \\rho-NN coupling \"runs\" in density, the\n\\omega-NN coupling does not scale: it will scale at two-loop or higher-loop\norder, but at a slower pace, so it is more appropriate to say it \"walks\" rather\nthan runs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Mar 2013 14:38:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 15 Jun 2013 12:21:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 26 Sep 2013 08:35:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-14"}

Here we tested a\npossibility that the Trojans were captured during the early dynamical\ninstability among the outer planets (aka the Nice model), when the semimajor\naxis of Jupiter was changing as a result of scattering encounters with an ice\ngiant. The capture occurs in this model when Jupiter's orbit and its Lagrange\npoints become radially displaced in a scattering event and fall into a region\npopulated by planetesimals (that previously evolved from their natal\ntransplanetary disk to ~5 AU during the instability). Our numerical simulations\nof the new capture model, hereafter jump capture, satisfactorily reproduce the\norbital distribution of the Trojans and their total mass.

We evidence several epochs of this energy\nconversion, each of them associated to a specific physical process. Firstly\npair creation occurs, secondly back reaction results in plasma oscillations.\nThirdly photons are produced by electron-positron annihilation. Finally\nparticle interactions lead to completely equilibrated thermal\nelectron-positron-photon plasma.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Mar 2013 15:26:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-13"}

(2011), where the gravitational Lagrangian is given by\nan arbitrary function of Ricci scalar $R$ and the trace of the stress-energy\ntensor $T$, have been investigated for a specific choice of $f(R, T) = f_{1}(R)\n+ f_{2}(T)$ by considering time dependent deceleration parameter. The concept\nof time dependent deceleration parameter (DP) with some proper assumptions\nyield the average scale factor $a(t) = \\sinh^{\\frac{1}{n}}(\\alpha t)$, where\n$n$ and $\\alpha$ are positive constants. For $0 < n \\leq 1$, this generates a\nclass of accelerating models while for $n > 1$, the models of universe exhibit\nphase transition from early decelerating phase to present accelerating phase\nwhich is in good agreement with the results from recent astrophysical\nobservations. Our intention is to reconstruct $f(R,T)$ models inspired by this\nspecial law for the deceleration parameter in connection with the theories of\nmodified gravity. In the present study we consider the cosmological constant\n$\\Lambda$ as a function of the trace of the stress energy-momentum-tensor, and\ndub such a model \"$\\Lambda(T)$ gravity\" where we have specified a certain form\nof $\\Lambda(T)$. Such models may display better uniformity with the\ncosmological observations. The statefinder diagnostic pair $\\{r,s\\}$ parameter\nhas been embraced to characterize different phases of the universe. We also\ndiscuss the physical consequences of the derived models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Mar 2013 14:54:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 Jul 2014 02:24:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-15"}

The measurement data set can either be collected from wet-lab\nexperiments or artificially created by computer simulations of dynamical models\nof the system. The algorithm is applicable to a wide range of biological\nsystems due to its ability to deal with nonlinear and stochastic system\ndynamics. To illustrate the application of the algorithm to a gene regulatory\nnetwork, the regulation of the toggle switch system is considered.

The first method is a\nrecursive procedure that uses the Cartesian product of sets starting from the\nset of 1-variable Boolean function and in the second method classification is\nachieved through a set of invariant bit positions with respect to an affine\nfunction belonging to that class.

Furthermore, we\ndevelop the paradigm of combined sparse representations, where only a part of\nthe coefficient vector is constrained to be non-negative, and the rest is\nunconstrained (general). We analyze the recovery of the unique, sparsest\nsolution, for combined representations, under three different cases of\ncoefficient support knowledge: (a) the non-zero supports of non-negative and\ngeneral coefficients are known, (b) the non-zero support of general\ncoefficients alone is known, and (c) both the non-zero supports are unknown.\nFor case (c), we propose the combined orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm for\ncoefficient recovery and derive the deterministic sparsity threshold under\nwhich recovery of the unique, sparsest coefficient vector is possible. We\nquantify the order complexity of the algorithms, and examine their performance\nin exact and approximate recovery of coefficients under various conditions of\nnoise. Furthermore, we also obtain their empirical phase transition\ncharacteristics. We show that the basis pursuit algorithm, with partial\nnon-negative constraints, and the proposed greedy algorithm perform better in\nrecovering the unique sparse representation when compared to their\nunconstrained counterparts. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of the proposed\nmethods in recovering images corrupted by saturation noise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Mar 2013 04:33:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 Sep 2013 20:22:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-24"}
