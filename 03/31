However, the picture\nof incoherent hopping is not applicable to some classes of molecular aggregates\n-- assemblies of molecules that have strong near field interaction between\nelectronic excitations in the individual subunits. Molecular aggregates can be\nfound in nature, in photosynthetic complexes of plants and bacteria, and they\ncan also be produced artificially in various forms including quasi-one\ndimensional chains, two-dimensional films, tubes, etc. In these structures\nlight is absorbed collectively by many molecules and the following dynamics of\nmolecular excitation possesses coherent properties. This energy transfer\nmechanism, mediated by the coherent exciton dynamics, resembles the propagation\nof electromagnetic waves through a structured medium on the nanometer scale.\nThe absorbed energy can be transferred resonantly over distances of hundreds of\nnanometers before exciton relaxation occurs. Furthermore, the spatial and\nenergetic landscape of molecular aggregates can enable the funneling of the\nexciton energy to a small number of molecules either within or outside the\naggregate.

Because of its\ngenerality and applications, the problem of Boolean Satisfiability (aka SAT) is\noften used as a vehicle for investigating this question. A signal result from\nthese studies is that the hardness of SAT problems exhibits a dramatic\neasy-to-hard phase transition with respect to the problem constrainedness. Past\nstudies have however focused mostly on SAT instances generated using uniform\nrandom distributions, where all constraints are independently generated, and\nthe problem variables are all considered of equal importance. These assumptions\nare unfortunately not satisfied by most real problems. Our project aims for a\ndeeper understanding of hardness of SAT problems that arise in practice. We\nstudy two key questions: (i) How does easy-to-hard transition change with more\nrealistic distributions that capture neighborhood sensitivity and\nrich-get-richer aspects of real problems and (ii) Can these changes be\nexplained in terms of the network properties (such as node centrality and\nsmall-worldness) of the clausal networks of the SAT problems. Our results,\nbased on extensive empirical studies and network analyses, provide important\nstructural and computational insights into realistic SAT problems. Our\nextensive empirical studies show that SAT instances from realistic\ndistributions do exhibit phase transition, but the transition occurs sooner (at\nlower values of constrainedness) than the instances from uniform random\ndistribution. We show that this behavior can be explained in terms of their\nclausal network properties such as eigenvector centrality and small-worldness\n(measured indirectly in terms of the clustering coefficients and average node\ndistance).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Mar 2013 23:21:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-02"}

SDO/AIA images clearly show the formation and ejection of a\nplasma blob from the lower solar atmosphere at ~9 min prior to the onset of the\nM1.0 flare. This onset of the M-class flare happened at the site of the blob\nformation, while the blob was rising in a parabolic path with an average speed\nof ~300 km/s. The blob also showed twisting and de-twisting motion in the lower\ncorona, and the blob speed varied from ~10-540 km/s. The faster and slower EUV\nwavefronts were observed in front of the plasma blob during its impulsive\nacceleration phase. The faster EUV wave propagated with a speed of ~785 to 1020\nkm/s, whereas the slower wavefront speed varied in between ~245 and 465 km/s.\nThe timing and speed of the faster wave match the shock speed estimated from\nthe drift rate of the associated type II radio burst. The faster wave\nexperiences a reflection by the nearby AR NOAA 11177. In addition, secondary\nwaves were observed (only in the 171 \\AA channel), when the primary fast wave\nand plasma blob impacted the funnel-shaped coronal loops. The HMI magnetograms\nrevealed the continuous emergence of new magnetic flux along with shear flows\nat the site of the blob formation. It is inferred that the emergence of twisted\nmagnetic fields in the form of arch-filaments/\"anemone-type\" loops is the\nlikely cause for the plasma blob formation and associated eruption along with\nthe triggering of M-class flare. Furthermore, the faster EUV wave formed ahead\nof the blob shows the signature of fast-mode MHD wave, whereas the slower wave\nseems to be generated by the field line compression by the plasma blob. The\nsecondary wave trains originated from the funnel-shaped loops are probably the\nfast magnetoacoustic waves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 31 Mar 2013 08:55:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

In particular, I\nargue that the physical explanation for quantum speedup is precisely the fact\nthat the phenomenon of quantum entanglement enables a quantum computer to fully\nexploit the representational capacity of Hilbert space. This is impossible for\nclassical systems, joint states of which must always be representable as\nproduct states.\n  Chapter 2 begins with a discussion of the most popular of the candidate\nphysical explanations for quantum speedup: the many worlds explanation. I argue\nthat unlike the neo-Everettian interpretation of quantum mechanics it does not\nhave the conceptual resources required to overcome the `preferred basis\nobjection'. I further argue that the many worlds explanation, at best, can\nserve as a good description of the physical process which takes place in\nso-called network-based computation, but that it is incompatible with other\nmodels of computation such as cluster state quantum computing. I next consider,\nin Chapter 3, a common component of most other candidate explanations of\nquantum speedup: quantum entanglement. I investigate whether entanglement can\nbe said to be a necessary component of any explanation for quantum speedup, and\nI consider two major purported counter-examples to this claim. I argue that\nneither of these, in fact, show that entanglement is unnecessary for speedup,\nand that, on the contrary, we should conclude that it is. In Chapters 4 and 5 I\nthen ask whether entanglement can be said to be sufficient as well. In Chapter\n4 I argue that despite a result that seems to indicate the contrary,\nentanglement, considered as a resource, can be seen as sufficient to enable\nquantum speedup. Finally, in Chapter 5 I argue that entanglement is sufficient\nto explain quantum speedup as well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 31 Mar 2013 14:14:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-02"}

It is know, due to Ringel, that a Hall algebra is\nisomorphic to a certain quantum group. It is our goal to describe a\ncategorification of Hall algebras as a way of doing so for their related\nquantum groups. To do this, we will take the following steps. First, we\ndescribe a new perspective on the structure theory of Hall algebras. This view\nsolves, in a unique way, the classic problem of the multiplication and\ncomultiplication not being compatible. Our solution is to switch to a different\nunderlying category $\\Vect^K$ of vector spaces graded by a group $K$ called the\nGrothendieck group. We equip this category with a nontrivial braiding which\ndepends on the $K$-grading. With this braiding and a given antipode, we find\nthat the Hall algebra does become a Hopf algebra object in $\\Vect^K$. Second,\nwe will describe a categorification process, call `groupoidification', which\nreplaces vector spaces with groupoids and linear operators with `spans' of\ngroupoids. We will use this process to construct a braided monoidal bicategory\nwhich categorifies $\\Vect^K$ via the groupoidification program. Specifically,\ngraded vector spaces will be replaced with groupoids `over' a fixed groupoid\nrelated to the Grothendieck group $K$. The braiding structure will come from an\ninteresting groupoid $\\EXT(M,N)$ which will behave like the Euler\ncharacteristic for the Grothendieck group $K$. We will finish with a\ndescription of our plan to, in future work, apply the same concept to the\nstructure maps of the Hall algebra, which will eventually give us a Hopf\n2-algebra object in our braided monoidal bicategory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 31 Mar 2013 15:47:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Apr 2013 00:55:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-03"}
