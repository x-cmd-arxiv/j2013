In\naddition to proprietary data, we used archival XMM data of the Orion Nebula\nCluster (ONC) to extend our analysis to a major fraction of the Orion A cloud.\nWe have detected 1060 X-ray sources in L1641 and Iota Ori region.

The\nremaining 205 X-ray sources are likely distant AGNs or other galactic sources\nnot related to Orion A. We find that Class III candidates appear more\nconcentrated in two main clusters in L1641. The first cluster of Class III\nstars is found toward the northern part of L1641, concentrated around Iota Ori.\nThe stars in this cluster are more evolved than those in the Orion Nebula.

Another cluster rich in Class III stars is located in L1641\nSouth and appears to be a slightly older cluster embedded in the Orion A cloud.\nFurthermore, other evolved Class III stars are found north of the ONC toward\nNGC 1977.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Mar 2013 17:14:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

For instance, for a power-law parameterisation\nwith both a tensor component and running parameter, current data show a\npreference for a negative running at more than $2.5\\sigma$ C.L. As a\nconsequence of this deviation from a power-law, constraints on the\ntensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ are slightly broader. We also present constraints on\nthe inflationary parameters for a model-independent reconstruction and the\nLasenby & Doran (LD) model. In particular, the constraints on the\ntensor-to-scalar ratio from the LD model are: $r_{\\rm LD}=0.11\\pm{0.024}$. In\naddition to current data, we show expected constraints from Planck-like and\nCMB-Pol sensitivity experiments by using Markov-Chain-Monte-Carlo sampling\nchains. For all the models, we have included the Bayesian Evidence to perform a\nmodel selection analysis. The Bayes factor, using current observations, shows a\nstrong preference for the LD model over the standard power-law\nparameterisation, and provides an insight into the accuracy of differentiating\nmodels through future surveys.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Mar 2013 19:41:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 Jun 2013 10:59:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

Several methods have been\ndeveloped where the performance measure retained richer information than the\nmere misclassification rate: misclassification costs, ROC-based information,\netc. Following this idea of dealing with alternate measures of performance, we\npropose to address imbalanced classification problems by using a new measure to\nbe optimized: the norm of the confusion matrix. Indeed, recent results show\nthat using the norm of the confusion matrix as an error measure can be quite\ninteresting due to the fine-grain informations contained in the matrix,\nespecially in the case of imbalanced classes. Our first contribution then\nconsists in showing that optimizing criterion based on the confusion matrix\ngives rise to a common background for cost-sensitive methods aimed at dealing\nwith imbalanced classes learning problems. As our second contribution, we\npropose an extension of a recent multi-class boosting method --- namely\nAdaBoost.MM --- to the imbalanced class problem, by greedily minimizing the\nempirical norm of the confusion matrix.

A comparison has also been made between\nthe performances of coherent and differential modulation scheme over static and\nfading channels. In the fading channels, it has been found that OFDM-based\nsystem's performance depends severely on Doppler shift which in turn depends on\nthe velocity of user.

The\nphylum Nematoda is divided into the Chromadorea (indcludes C. elegans) and the\nEnoplea. Compared to C. elegans, enoplean nematodes have very different\npatterns of cell division and determination. Embryogenesis of the enoplean\nRomanomermis culicivorax has been studied in great detail, but the genetic\ncircuitry underpinning development in this species is unknown. Results We\ncreated a draft genome of R. culicivorax and compared its developmental gene\ncontent with that of two nematodes, C. elegans and Trichinella spiralis\n(another enoplean), and a representative arthropod Tribolium castaneum. This\ngenome evidence shows that R. culicivorax retains components of the conserved\nmetazoan developmental toolkit lost in C. elegans. T. spiralis has\nindependently lost even more of the toolkit than has C. elegans. However, the\nC. elegans toolkit is not simply depauperate, as many genes essential for\nembryogenesis in C. elegans are unique to this lineage, or have only extremely\ndivergent homologues in R. culicivorax and T. spiralis. These data imply\nfundamental differences in the genetic programmes for early cell specification,\ninductive interactions, vulva formation and sex determination. Conclusions Thus\nnematodes, despite their apparent phylum-wide morphological conservatism, have\nevolved major differences in the molecular logic of their development. R.\nculicivorax serves as a tractable, contrasting model to C. elegans for\nunderstanding how divergent genomic and thus regulatory backgrounds can\ngenerate a conserved phenotype. The availability of the draft genome will\npromote use of R. culicivorax as a research model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Mar 2013 11:22:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-19"}

So, the aspect\nparadigm is regarded as a promising software development technique which can\nreduce the complexity and cost of developing large software systems. This\nopportunity can be used to develop a CIS able to support the interconnection of\norganizations information systems in order to ensure a common global service\nand to support the tempo of change in the business world that is increasing at\nan exponential level. We previously proposed an approach named AspeCiS (An\nAspect-oriented Approach to Develop a Cooperative Information System) to\ndevelop a Cooperative Information System from existing Information Systems by\nusing their artifacts such as existing requirements, and design. In this\napproach we have studied how to elicit CIS Requirements called Cooperative\nRequirements in AspeCiS. In this paper we propose a weaving process to define\nthese requirements by reusing existing requirements and new aspectual\nrequirements that we define to modify these requirements in order to be reused.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Mar 2013 12:13:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-19"}

This implies that a typical multiplex of\nthe ensemble can have a significant overlap of the links in the different\nlayers.

The nearest-neighbor and second-neighbor\nexchange integrals, J1 and J2, are evaluated as a function of the Cu-X-Cu\nbridging angle, theta, in the physically relevant range 80-110deg. In the ionic\nCuF2, J1 is ferromagnetic for theta smaller 100deg.

However, both CuCl2 and CuBr2 feature\nferromagnetic J1 in the whole angular range studied.
