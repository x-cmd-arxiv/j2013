In this model we investigate the\neffect of kinematical backreaction on the evolution of cosmological parameters\nas they are defined in an averaged inhomogeneous cosmology, and we show that\nthe backreaction model interpolates between orthogonal symmetry properties by\ncovering subcases of the plane-symmetric solution, the Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi\nsolution and the Szekeres solution.

Universal order parameter\nequations written for complex matter fields are widely used to describe systems\nas different as Bose-Einstein condensates of ultra cold atomic gases, thermal\nconvection, nematic liquid crystals, lasers and other nonlinear systems.\nExciton-polariton condensates recently realised in semiconductor microcavities\nare pattern forming systems that lie somewhere between equilibrium\nBose-Einstein condensates and lasers. Because of the imperfect confinement of\nthe photon component, exciton-polaritons have a finite lifetime, and have to be\ncontinuously re-populated. As photon confinement improves, the system more\nclosely approximates an equilibrium system. In this chapter we review a number\nof universal equations which describe various regimes of the dynamics of\nexciton-polariton condensates: the Gross-Pitaevskii equation, which models\nweakly interacting equilibrium condensates, the complex Ginsburg-Landau\nequation---the universal equation that describes the behaviour of systems in\nthe vicinity of a symmetry--breaking instability, and the complex\nSwift-Hohenberg equation that in comparison with the complex Ginsburg-Landau\nequation contains additional nonlocal terms responsible for spacial mode\nselection. All these equations can be derived asymptotically from a generic\nlaser model given by Maxwell-Bloch equations.

Recent efforts have\nbeen aimed at understanding the genetic basis of disease susceptibility, with\ngenome-wide association studies (GWAS) unveiling some promising associations.\nNevertheless, the genetic etiology of BD remains elusive with a substantial\nproportion of the heritability - which has been estimated to be 80% based on\ntwin and family studies - unaccounted for by the specific genetic variants\nidentified by large-scale GWAS. Furthermore, functional understanding of\nassociated loci generally lags discovery. Studies we report here provide\nconsiderable support to the claim that substantially more remains to be gained\nfrom GWAS on the genetic mechanisms underlying BD susceptibility, and that a\nlarge proportion of the variation in disease risk may be uncovered through\nintegrative functional genomic approaches. We combine recent analytic advances\nin heritability estimation and polygenic modeling and leverage recent\ntechnological advances in the generation of -omics data to evaluate the nature\nand scale of the contribution of functional classes of genetic variation to a\nrelatively intractable disorder. We identified cis eQTLs in cerebellum and\nparietal cortex that capture more than half of the total heritability\nattributable to SNPs interrogated through GWAS and showed that eQTL-based\nheritability estimation is highly tissue-dependent. Our findings show that a\nmuch greater resolution may be attained than has been reported thus far on the\nnumber of common loci that capture a substantial proportion of the heritability\nto disease risk and that the functional nature of contributory loci may be\nclarified en masse.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Mar 2013 17:43:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 29 Mar 2013 04:45:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-01"}

How to construct the\nfull intrinsic folding landscape (without the handles and the beads) from the\nmeasured time series is a major unsolved problem. By using rigorous theoretical\nmethods---which account for fluctuations of the DNA handles, rotation of the\noptical beads, variations in applied tension due to finite trap stiffness, as\nwell as environmental noise and the limited bandwidth of the apparatus---we\nprovide a tractable method to derive intrinsic free energy profiles.

Studying a 27 Msun progenitor, we\ndemonstrate, for the first time, that violent SASI activity can develop in 3D\nsimulations with detailed neutrino transport despite the presence of\nconvection. This result was obtained with the Prometheus-Vertex code with the\nsame sophisticated neutrino treatment so far used only in 1D and 2D models.\nWhile buoyant plumes initially determine the nonradial mass motions in the\npostshock layer, bipolar shock sloshing with growing amplitude sets in during a\nphase of shock retraction and turns into a violent spiral mode whose growth is\nonly quenched when the infall of the Si/SiO interface leads to strong shock\nexpansion in response to a dramatic decrease of the mass accretion rate. In the\nphase of large-amplitude SASI sloshing and spiral motions, the postshock layer\nexhibits nonradial deformation dominated by the lowest-order spherical\nharmonics (l=1, m=0,-1,+1) in distinct contrast to the higher multipole\nstructures associated with neutrino-driven convection. We find that the SASI\namplitudes, shock asymmetry, and nonradial kinetic energy in 3D can exceed\nthose of the corresponding 2D case during extended periods of the evolution.

This hypothesis is\nmotivated by two characteristics found generically in simulations of binaries\nembedded in prograde accretion discs: (i) the formation of a central,\nlow-density cavity around the binary, and (ii) the leakage of gas into this\ncavity, occurring once per orbit via discrete streams on nearly radial\ntrajectories. The first feature would reduce the emergent optical/UV flux of\nthe system relative to active galactic nuclei powered by single SMBHs, while\nthe second can trigger quasiperiodic fluctuations in luminosity. I argue that\nthe quasiperiodic accretion signature may be much more dramatic than previously\nthought, because the infalling gas streams can strongly shock-heat via\nself-collision and tidal compression, thereby enhancing viscous accretion. Any\noptically thick gas that is circularized about either SMBH can accrete before\nthe next pair of streams is deposited, fueling transient, luminous flares that\nrecur every orbit. Due to the diminished flux in between accretion episodes,\nsuch cavity-accretion flares could plausibly be mistaken for the tidal\ndisruptions of stars in quiescent nuclei. The flares could be distinguished\nfrom tidal disruption events if their quasiperiodic recurrence is observed, or\nif they are produced by very massive SMBHs that cannot disrupt solar-type\nstars. They may be discovered serendipitously in surveys such as LSST or\neROSITA. I present a heuristic toy model as a proof of concept for the\nproduction of cavity-accretion flares, and generate mock light curves and\nspecta.

We remove any remaining gas\nand follow the evolution of structure in the clusters (measured by the\nQ-parameter), half-mass radius, central density, surface density and the\nfraction of bound stars. There is little discernible difference in the\nevolution of clusters that formed with feedback compared to those that formed\nwithout. The only clear trend is that all clusters which form without feedback\nin the hydrodynamical simulations lose any initial structure over 10Myr,\nwhereas some of the clusters which form with feedback retain structure for the\nduration of the subsequent N-body simulation. This is due to lower initial\ndensities (and hence longer relaxation times) in the clusters from Dale et al.\n(2012, 2013) which formed with feedback, which prevents dynamical mixing from\nerasing substructure. However, several other conditions (such as supervirial\ninitial velocities) also preserve substructure, so at a given epoch one would\nrequire knowledge of the initial density and virial state of the cluster in\norder to determine whether star formation in a cluster has been strongly\ninfluenced by feedback.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Mar 2013 20:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

Assuming linear color-to-metallicity conversions, bimodality is viewed\nas the presence of merely two GC subsystems with distinct metallicities, which\nserves as a critical backbone of various galaxy formation theories. Recent\nstudies, however, revealed that the color-metallicity relations (CMRs) often\nused to derive GC metallicities (e.g., CMRs of g-z, V-I and C-T1) are in fact\ninflected. Such inflection can create bimodal color distributions if the\nunderlying GC metallicity spread is simply broad as expected from the\nhierarchical merging paradigm of galaxy formation. In order to test the\nnonlinear-CMR scenario for GC color bimodality, the u-band photometry is\nproposed because the u-related CMRs (e.g., CMRs of u-g and u-z) are\ntheoretically predicted to be least inflected and most distinctive among\ncommonly used optical CMRs. Here, we present Hubble Space Telescope (HST)/WFC3\nF336W (u-band) photometry of the GC system in M84, a giant elliptical in the\nVirgo galaxy cluster. Combining the u data with the existing HST ACS/WFC g and\nz data, we find that the u-z and u-g color distributions are different from the\ng-z distribution in a very systematic manner and remarkably consistent with our\nmodel predictions based on the nonlinear-CMR hypothesis. The results lend\nfurther confidence to validity of the nonlinear-CMR scenario as an explanation\nfor GC color bimodality. There are some GC systems showing bimodal\nspectroscopic metallicity, and in such systems the inflected CMRs often create\nstronger bimodality in the color domain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Mar 2013 20:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

In this paper, we quantify which physical mechanisms could\nbe responsible. On scales larger than the disc scale height, the low SFR is\nfound to be consistent with episodic star formation due to secular\ninstabilities or possibly variations of the gas inflow along the Galactic bar.\nThe CMZ is marginally Toomre-stable when including gas and stars, but highly\nToomre-stable when only accounting for the gas, indicating a low condensation\nrate of self-gravitating clouds. On small scales, we find that the SFR in the\nCMZ may be caused by an elevated critical density for star formation due to the\nhigh turbulent pressure. The existence of a universal density threshold for\nstar formation is ruled out. The HI-H$_2$ phase transition of hydrogen, the\ntidal field, a possible underproduction of massive stars due to a bottom-heavy\ninitial mass function, magnetic fields, and cosmic ray or radiation pressure\nfeedback also cannot individually explain the low SFR. We propose a\nself-consistent cycle of star formation in the CMZ, in which the effects of\nseveral different processes combine to inhibit star formation. The\nrate-limiting factor is the slow evolution of the gas towards collapse - once\nstar formation is initiated it proceeds at a normal rate. The ubiquity of star\nformation inhibitors suggests that a lowered central SFR should be a common\nphenomenon in other galaxies. We discuss the implications for galactic-scale\nstar formation and supermassive black hole growth, and relate our results to\nthe star formation conditions in other extreme environments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Mar 2013 20:00:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Mar 2014 17:43:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 12 Mar 2014 14:38:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

The primary concern of this work\nis the development of NIR observation and reduction methods to recover a\nuniform surface brightness map across the 3x1 degree disk of M31. This\nnecessitates sky-target nodding across 27 WIRCam fields. Two sky-target nodding\nstrategies were tested, and we find that strictly minimizing sky sampling\nlatency does not maximize sky subtraction accuracy, which is at best 2% of the\nsky level. The mean surface brightness difference between blocks in our mosaic\ncan be reduced from 1% to 0.1% of the sky brightness by introducing scalar sky\noffsets to each image. The true surface brightness of M31 can be known to\nwithin a statistical zeropoint of 0.15% of the sky level (0.2 mag arcsec sq.\nuncertainty at R=15 kpc). Surface brightness stability across individual WIRCam\nframes is limited by both WIRCam flat field evolution and residual sky\nbackground shapes. To overcome flat field variability of order 1% over 30\nminutes, we find that WIRCam data should be calibrated with real-time sky\nflats. Due either to atmospheric or instrumental variations, the individual\nWIRCam frames have typical residual shapes with amplitudes of 0.2% of the sky\nafter real-time flat fielding and median sky subtraction. We present our WIRCam\nreduction pipeline and performance analysis here as a template for future\nnear-infrared observers needing wide-area surface brightness maps with\nsky-target nodding, and give specific recommendations for improving photometry\nof all CFHT/WIRCam programs.

Such division of extragalactic GCs, so far asserted\nmainly by photometric color bimodality, has been viewed as the presence of\nmerely two distinct metallicity subgroups within individual galaxies and forms\na critical backbone of various galaxy formation theories. Given that\nspectroscopy is a more detailed probe into stellar population than photometry,\nthe discovery of index bimodality may point to the very existence of dual GC\npopulations. However, here we show that the observed spectroscopic dichotomy of\nM31 GCs emerges due to the nonlinear nature of metallicity-to-index conversion\nand thus one does not necessarily have to invoke two separate GC subsystems. We\ntake this as a close analogy to the recent view that metallicity-color\nnonlinearity is primarily responsible for observed GC color bimodality. We also\ndemonstrate that the metallicity-sensitive magnesium line displays\nnon-negligible metallicity-index nonlinearity and Balmer lines show rather\nstrong nonlinearity. This gives rise to bimodal index distributions, which are\nroutinely interpreted as bimodal metallicity distributions, not considering\nmetallicity-index nonlinearity.

A parametric study of the ratios\nfor different harmonics of the mode is also carried out.\n  Methods: Full magnetohydrodynamic numerical simulations were performed using\nLare2d, simulating hot, dense loops in a magnetic slab environment. The\nsymmetric Epstein profile and a simple step-function profile were both used to\nmodel the density structure of the simulated loops. Analytical expressions for\nthe cut-off wavenumber and the harmonic ratio between the second longitudinal\nharmonic and the fundamental were also examined.\n  Results: It was established that the period of the global sausage mode is\nonly very weakly dependent on the value of the plasma-beta inside a coronal\nloop, which justifies the application of this model to hot flaring loops. The\ncut-off wavenumber kc for the global mode was found to be dependent on both\ninternal and external values of the plasma-beta, again only weakly. By far the\nmost important factor in this case was the value of the density contrast ratio\nbetween the loop and the surroundings. Finally, the deviation of the harmonic\nratio P1/2P2 from the ideal non-dispersive case was shown to be considerable at\nlow k, again strongly dependent on plasma density. Quantifying the behaviour of\nthe cut-off wavenumber and the harmonic ratio has significant applications to\nthe field of coronal seismology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Mar 2013 20:20:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-27"}

Recently, Nakariakov & Zimovets (2011) proposed a new model\nsuggesting that, in two-ribbon flares, such pulsations could be explained by\npropagating slow waves. These waves may travel obliquely to the magnetic field,\nreflect in the chromosphere and constructively interfere at a spatially\nseparate site in the corona, leading to quasi-periodic reconnection events\nprogressing along the flaring arcade. Such a slow wave regime would have\ncertain observational characteristics. We search for evidence of this\nphenomenon during a selection of two-ribbon flares observed by RHESSI, SOHO and\nTRACE; the flares of 2002 November 9, 2005 January 19 and 2005 August 22. We\nwere not able to observe a clear correlation between hard X-ray footpoint\nseparations and pulse timings during these events. Also, the motion of hard\nX-ray footpoints is shown to be continuous within the observational error,\nwhereas a discontinuous motion might be anticipated in the slow wave model.\nFinally, we find that for a preferential slow wave propagation angle of 25-28\ndegrees that is expected for the fastest waves, the velocities of the hard\nX-ray footpoints lead to estimated pulse periods and ribbon lengths\nsignificantly larger than the measured values. Hence, for the three events\nstudied, we conclude that the observational characteristics cannot be easily\nexplained via the Nakariakov & Zimovets (2011) propagating slow wave model when\nonly angles of 25-28 degrees are considered.

The radio sample is generated using a\ncombination of NVSS data and K-band UKIDSS-LAS data, over 0.01<z<0.8. The FIR\nproperties of the sample are investigated as a function of L_1.4 GHz, z,\nprojected radio-source size and radio spectral index. In order to search for\nstellar-mass dependent relations, we split the parent sample into those sources\nwhich are below and above 1.5 L_{K}^{*}. Correcting for stellar mass and\nredshift, we find no relation between the L250 and L_1.4GHz of radio AGN. This\nimplies that a galaxy's nominal radio luminosity has little or no bearing on\nthe SFR and/or dust mass content of the host system. The L250 of both the radio\ndetected and non radio-detected galaxies (defined as those sources not detected\nat 1.4GHz but detected in the SDSS with r'<22) rises with increasing z. For\nmass and colour matched samples, sub-1.5 L_{K}^{*} and super-1.5 L_{K}^{*}\nradio-detected galaxies have 0.89\\pm0.18 and 0.49\\pm0.12 times the L250 of\ntheir non radio-detected counterparts.

Compact radio sources (<30kpc)\nare associated with higher L250s and dust temperatures than their more extended\n(>30kpc) counterparts.

The observations cover several states of the source,\nand therefore a large range of inferred mass accretion rate. These six\nobservations show a broad emission line in the spectrum at around 6.5 keV,\nlikely due to iron. We fitted this line with a set of phenomenological models\nof a relativistically broadened line, plus a model that accounts for\nrelativistically smeared and ionised reflection from the accretion disc. The\nlatter model includes the incident emission from both the neutron-star surface\nor boundary layer and the corona that is responsible for the high-energy\nemission in these systems. From the fits with the reflection model we found\nthat in four out of the six observations the main contribution to the reflected\nspectrum comes from the neutron-star surface or boundary layer, whereas in the\nother two observations the main contribution to the reflected spectrum comes\nfrom the corona. We found that the relative contribution of these two\ncomponents is not correlated to the state of the source. From the\nphenomenological models we found that the iron line profile is better described\nby a symmetric, albeit broad, profile. The width of the line cannot be\nexplained only by Compton broadening, and we therefore explored the case of\nrelativistic broadening. We further found that the direct emission from the\ndisc, boundary layer, and corona generally evolved in a manner consistent with\nthe standard accretion disc model, with the disc and boundary layer becoming\nhotter and the disc moving inwards as the source changed from the hard in to\nthe soft state. The iron line, however, did not appear to follow the same\ntrend.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Mar 2013 22:28:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

In the absence of dephasing, the heat\ntransport is ballistic for weak interactions, while being diffusive in the\nstrongly-interacting regime, as evidenced by the heat-current scaling with the\nsystem size. When bulk dephasing takes place in the system, diffusive transport\nis induced in the weakly-interacting regime, with the heat current\nmonotonically decreasing with the dephasing rate. In contrast, in the\nstrongly-interacting regime, the heat current can be significantly enhanced by\ndephasing for systems of small size.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Mar 2013 00:30:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 Jun 2013 21:24:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-17"}

A significant\ndesign decision for any such system is whether to process and use all possible\nfaces detected over the video frames, or whether to select only a few \"best\"\nfaces. This paper presents a video face recognition system based on\nprobabilistic Multi-Region Histograms to characterise performance trade-offs\nin: (i) selecting a subset of faces compared to using all faces, and (ii)\ncombining information from all faces via clustering. Three face selection\nmetrics are evaluated for choosing a subset: face detection confidence, random\nsubset, and sequential selection. Experiments on the recently introduced MOBIO\ndataset indicate that the usage of all faces through clustering always\noutperformed selecting only a subset of faces. The experiments also show that\nthe face selection metric based on face detection confidence generally provides\nbetter recognition performance than random or sequential sampling. Moreover,\nthe optimal number of faces varies drastically across selection metric and\nsubsets of MOBIO. Given the trade-offs between computational effort,\nrecognition accuracy and robustness, it is recommended that face feature\nclustering would be most advantageous in batch processing (particularly for\nvideo-based watchlists), whereas face selection methods should be limited to\napplications with significant computational restrictions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Mar 2013 01:34:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-27"}

Using self-reported friendship and non-friendship labels derived\nfrom an anonymous online survey, we learn highly accurate predictors for\nrecovering hidden friendships within a massive online data set encompassing 18\nbillion interactions among 17 million individuals of the popular online game\nHalo: Reach. We find that the accuracy of many features improves as more data\naccumulates, and cooperative features are generally reliable. However,\nperiodicities in interaction time series are sufficient to correctly classify\n95% of ties, even for casual users. These results clarify the nature of\nfriendship in online social environments and suggest new opportunities and new\nprivacy concerns for friendship-aware applications that do not require the\ndisclosure of private friendship information.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Mar 2013 02:58:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-17"}

To address this issue, we have developed a new model\nthat consists of two major components: electrochemical and chemomechanical\nsubsystems of the cell. Included in the electrochemical model are models of the\nelectrophysiological behavior of the cell membrane, fluid compartments, Ca2+\nrelease and uptake by the sarcoplasmic reticulum, and cytosolic Ca2+ buffering,\nparticularly by calmodulin. With this subsystem model, we can study the\nmechanics of the production of intracellular Ca2+ transient in response to\nmembrane voltage clamp pulses. The chemomechanical model includes models of:\n(a) the chemical kinetics of myosin phosphorylation, and the formation of\nphosphorylated myosin cross-bridges with actin, as well as, attached latch-type\ncross-bridges; and (b) a model of force generation and mechanical coupling to\nthe contractile filaments and their attachments to protein structures and the\nskeletal framework of the cell. The two subsystem models are tested\nindependently and compared with data. Likewise, the complete (combined) cell\nmodel responses to voltage pulse stimulation under isometric and isotonic\nconditions are calculated and compared with measured single cell length-force\nand force-velocity data obtained from literature.

The recent growth of Massively Multi-player\nOnline Games (MMOGs) has provided unprecedented access to large-scale data\nwhich enables us to study such complex human behavior in a more systematic\nmanner. In this paper, we consider three different networks in the EverQuest2\ngame: chat, trade, and trust. The chat network has the highest level of\nreciprocation (33%) because there are essentially no barriers to it. The trade\nnetwork has a lower rate of reciprocation (27%) because it has the obvious\nbarrier of requiring more goods or money for exchange; morever, there is no\nclear benefit to returning a trade link except in terms of social connections.\nThe trust network has the lowest reciprocation (14%) because this equates to\nsharing certain within-game assets such as weapons, and so there is a high\nbarrier for such connections because they require faith in the players that are\ngranted such high access. In general, we observe that reciprocation rate is\ninversely related to the barrier level in these networks. We also note that\nreciprocation has connections across the heterogeneous networks. Our\nexperiments indicate that players make use of the medium-barrier reciprocations\nto strengthen a relationship.

We present the first CO observations of luminous infrared galaxies\n(LIRGs) inside the virial radii of two intermediate redshift clusters,\nCL1416+4446 (z=0.397) and CL0926+1242 (z=0.489). We detect three galaxies at\nhigh significance (5 to 10 sigma), and provide robust estimates of their CO\nluminosities, L'CO. In order to put our results into a general context, we\nrevisit the relation between cold and hot gas and stellar mass in nearby field\nand cluster galaxies. We find evidence that at fixed LIR (or fixed stellar\nmass), the frequency of high L'CO galaxies is lower in clusters than in the\nfield, suggesting environmental depletion of the reservoir of cold gas. The\nlevel of star formation activity in a galaxy is primarily linked to the amount\nof cold gas, rather than to the galaxy mass or the lookback time. In clusters,\njust as in the field, the conversion between gas and stars seems universal. The\nrelation between LIR and L'CO for distant cluster galaxies extends the relation\nof nearby galaxies to higher IR luminosities. Nevertheless, the intermediate\nredshift galaxies fall well within the dispersion of the trend defined by local\nsystems. Considering that L'CO is generally derived from the CO(1-0) line and\nsensitive to the vast majority of the molecular gas in the cold interstellar\nmedium of galaxies, but less to the part which will actually be used to form\nstars, we suggest that molecular gas can be stripped before the star formation\nrate is affected. Combining the sample of Geach et al. (2009, 2011) and ours,\nwe find evidence for a decrease in CO towards the cluster centers.

Two variant methods are\ninvestigated through numerical simulations. They both solely involve\npost-processing of the propagated high-frequency (HF) imaging wave fields,\nwhich in real-time imaging corresponds to post-processing of the beamformed\nreceive radio-frequency signals. Hence the transmit pulse complexes are the\nsame as for the previously published SURF reverberation-suppression imaging\nmethod. The adjustment technique is tested on simulated data from propagation\nof SURF pulse complexes consisting of a 3.5 MHz HF imaging pulse added to a 0.5\nlow-frequency sound-speed manipulation pulse. Imaging transmit beams are\nconstructed with and without adjustment. The post-processing involves\nfiltering, e.g., by a time-shift, in order to equalize the two SURF HF pulses\nat a chosen depth. This depth is typically chosen to coincide with the depth\nwhere the first scattering or reflection occurs for the reverberation noise one\nintends to suppress. The beams realized with post-processing show energy\ndecrease at the chosen depth, especially for shallow depths where in a medical\nimaging situation often a body-wall is located.

Non-linear\nintegrations of this model show that as the energy input rate of the forcing is\nincreased, the homogeneity of the flow is broken with the emergence of\nnon-zonal, coherent, westward propagating structures and at larger energy input\nrates by the emergence of zonal jets. We study the emergence of non-zonal\ncoherent structures using a non-equilibrium statistical theory, Stochastic\nStructural Stability Theory (S3T, previously referred to as SSST). S3T directly\nmodels a second order approximation to the statistical mean turbulent state and\nallows identification of statistical turbulent equilibria and study of their\nstability. Using S3T, the bifurcation properties of the homogeneous state in\nbarotropic beta-plane turbulence are determined.

Unlike previous dipolar Poisson-Boltzmann\nformulations treating the solvent molecules as point dipoles, our model is able\nto qualitatively reproduce the non-local dielectric response behavior of polar\nliquids observed in Molecular Dynamics simulations and Atomic Force Microscope\nexperiments for water solvent at charged interfaces. The present theory\nexplains the formation of the associated interfacial hydration layers in terms\nof a cooperative dipolar response mechanism driven by the reaction of the\nsolvent molecules to their own polarization field. We also incorporate into the\ntheory the relative multipole/dipole moments of water molecules obtained from\nquantum mechanical calculations, and show that the multipolar contributions to\nthe dielectric permittivity are largely dominated by the dipolar one.

However, it is only recently that this relationship has been elucidated,\nand that fully nonlinear results have been obtained.

Here, only nondissipative models are\nconsidered, and a most basic question is investigated, namely the expected link\nbetween the hyperbolicity of modulated equations and the spectral stability of\nperiodic traveling waves to sideband perturbations. This is done first in an\nabstract Hamiltonian framework, which encompasses a number of dispersive\nmodels, in particular the well-known (generalized) Korteweg--de Vries equation,\nand the less known Euler--Korteweg system, in both Eulerian coordinates and\nLagrangian coordinates. The latter is itself an abstract framework for several\nmodels arising in water waves theory, superfluidity, and quantum hydrodynamics.\nAs regards its application to compressible capillary fluids, attention is paid\nhere to untangle the interplay between traveling waves/modulation equations in\nEulerian coordinates and those in Lagrangian coordinates. In the most general\nsetting, it is proved that the hyperbolicity of modulated equations is indeed\nnecessary for the spectral stability of periodic traveling waves. This extends\nearlier results by Serre [Comm. Partial Differential Equations 2005], Oh and\nZumbrun [Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal. 2003], and Johnson, Zumbrun and Bronski\n[Phys. D 2010]. In addition, reduced necessary conditions are obtained in the\nsmall amplitude limit. Then numerical investigations are carried out for the\nmodulated equations of the Euler--Korteweg system with two types of 'pressure'\nlaws, namely the quadratic law of shallow water equations, and the nonmonotone\nvan der Waals pressure law. Both the evolutionarity and the hyperbolicity of\nthe modulated equations are tested, and regions of modulational instability are\nthus exhibited.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Mar 2013 13:05:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

The stress-strain curve\ncorresponding to the less ductile $Zr_{65}Cu_{15}Ni_{10}Al_{10}$ alloy is shown\nto exhibit finite correlation dimension and a positive Lyapunov exponent,\nsuggesting that the underlying dynamics is chaotic.

To this purpose we introduce\nthe concept of residual clumpiness, C_R, that quantifies the large-scale\ninhomogeneity of the ICM. After showing that this quantity can be robustly\ndefined for relaxed systems, we characterize how it varies with radius, mass\nand dynamical state of the halo. Most importantly, we observe that it\nintroduces an overestimate in the determination of the density profile from the\nX-ray emission, which translates into a systematic overestimate of 6 (12)% in\nthe measurement of M_gas at R_200 for our relaxed (perturbed) cluster sample.\nAt the same time, the increase of C_R with radius introduces also a ~2%\nsystematic underestimate in the measurement of the hydrostatic-equilibrium mass\n(M_he), which adds to the previous one generating a systematic ~8.5%\noverestimate in f_gas in our relaxed sample. Since the residual clumpiness of\nthe ICM is not directly observable, we study its correlation with the azimuthal\nscatter in the X-ray surface brightness of the halo and in the y-parameter\nprofiles. We find that their correlation is highly significant (r_S = 0.6-0.7),\nallowing to define the azimuthal scatter measured in the X-ray surface\nbrightness profile and in the y-parameter as robust proxies of C_R. After\nproviding a function that connects the two quantities, we obtain that\ncorrecting the observed gas density profiles using the azimuthal scatter\neliminates the bias in the measurement of M_gas for relaxed objects, which\nbecomes (0+/-2)% up to 2R_200, and reduces it by a factor of 3 for perturbed\nones. This method allows also to eliminate the systematics on the measurements\nof M_he and f_gas, although a significant halo to halo scatter remains.\n(abridged)\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Mar 2013 14:21:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

Different\npathophysiological mechanisms are now thought to underlie headache and sleep\ndisturbance during acute exposure to high altitude. Hence, these symptoms may\nnot belong together as a single syndrome. Using a novel visual analogue scale\n(VAS), we sought to undertake a systematic exploration of the symptomatology of\nAMS using an unbiased, data-driven approach originally designed for analysis of\ngene expression. Symptom scores were collected from 293 subjects during 1110\nsubject-days at altitudes between 3650m and 5200m on Apex expeditions to\nBolivia and Kilimanjaro. Three distinct patterns of symptoms were consistently\nidentified. Although fatigue is a ubiquitous finding, sleep disturbance and\nheadache are each commonly reported without the other. The commonest pattern of\nsymptoms was sleep disturbance and fatigue, with little or no headache. In\nsubjects reporting severe headache, 40% did not report sleep disturbance. Sleep\ndisturbance correlates poorly with other symptoms of AMS (Pearson r = 0.31 vs\nheadache). These results challenge the accepted paradigm that AMS is a single\ndisease process and describe at least two distinct syndromes following acute\nascent to high altitude.

The complex coupling coefficients $\\omega$ between\nsystem and environment arise from the principal value integral and the\nresiduum. At high level density where the resonance states overlap, the\ndynamics of the system is determined by exceptional points. At these points,\nthe eigenvalues of two states are equal and the corresponding eigenfunctions\nare linearly dependent. It is shown in the present paper that Im$(\\omega)$ and\nRe$(\\omega)$ influence the system properties differently in the surrounding of\nexceptional points. Controlling the system by a parameter, the eigenvalues\navoid crossing in energy near an exceptional point under the influence of\nRe$(\\omega)$ in a similar manner as it is well known from discrete states.\nIm$(\\omega)$ however leads to width bifurcation and finally (when the system is\ncoupled to one channel, i.e. to a common continuum of scattering\nwavefunctions), to a splitting of the system into two parts with different\ncharacteristic time scales. Physically, the system is stabilized by this\nsplitting since the lifetimes of most ($N-1$) states are longer than before\nwhile that of only one state is shorter. In the cross section the short-lived\nstate appears as a background term in high-resolution experiments. The\nwavefunctions of the long-lived states are mixed in those of the original ones\nin a comparably large parameter range. Numerical results for the eigenvalues\nand eigenfunctions are shown for $N=2, ~4$ and 10 states coupled mostly to 1\nchannel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Mar 2013 15:58:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

The SMEI light\ncurve, providing unprecedented detail with high cadence data during t=1.5-49\ndays post-discovery, was divided into four phases based on the idealised nova\noptical light curve; the initial rise, the pre-maximum halt (or the 'plateau'),\nthe final rise, and the early decline. Variation in the SMEI light curve\nreveals a strongly detected period of 1.44\\pm0.04 days before the visual\nmaximum. The spectra from the LT and SMARTS telescopes were investigated during\nt=0.8-80.7 and 155.1-249.9 days. The nova was observed very early in its rise\nand a distinct high velocity ejection phase was evident. A marked drop and then\ngradual increase in derived ejection velocities were present. Here we propose\ntwo different stages of mass loss, a short-lived phase occurring immediately\nafter outburst followed by a more steadily evolving and higher mass loss phase.\nThe overall spectral development follows that typical of a Classical Nova and\ncomparison to the photometric behaviour reveals consistencies with the simple\nevolving pseudo-photosphere model of the nova outburst. The optical spectra are\nalso compared to X-ray and radio light curves. Weak [Fe X] 6375A emission was\nmarginally detected before the rise in X-ray emission. The middle of the\nplateau in the X-ray light curve is coincident with the appearance of high\nionization species detected in optical spectra and the peak of the high\nfrequency radio flux.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Mar 2013 17:34:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 27 Mar 2013 16:24:09 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 28 Mar 2013 16:00:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-29"}
