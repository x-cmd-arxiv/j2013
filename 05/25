CS exploits the signal's sparsity or compressibility in a\nparticular domain and integrates data compression and acquisition, thus\nallowing exact reconstruction through relatively few non-adaptive linear\nmeasurements. While conventional CS theory relies on data representation in the\nform of vectors, many data types in various applications such as color imaging,\nvideo sequences, and multi-sensor networks, are intrinsically represented by\nhigher-order tensors. Application of CS to higher-order data representation is\ntypically performed by conversion of the data to very long vectors that must be\nmeasured using very large sampling matrices, thus imposing a huge computational\nand memory burden. In this paper, we propose Generalized Tensor Compressive\nSensing (GTCS)--a unified framework for compressive sensing of higher-order\ntensors which preserves the intrinsic structure of tensor data with reduced\ncomputational complexity at reconstruction. GTCS offers an efficient means for\nrepresentation of multidimensional data by providing simultaneous acquisition\nand compression from all tensor modes. In addition, we propound two\nreconstruction procedures, a serial method (GTCS-S) and a parallelizable method\n(GTCS-P). We then compare the performance of the proposed method with Kronecker\ncompressive sensing (KCS) and multi way compressive sensing (MWCS). We\ndemonstrate experimentally that GTCS outperforms KCS and MWCS in terms of both\nreconstruction accuracy (within a range of compression ratios) and processing\nspeed. The major disadvantage of our methods (and of MWCS as well), is that the\ncompression ratios may be worse than that offered by KCS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 May 2013 16:01:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 21 Oct 2013 17:42:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 12 Apr 2014 20:58:59 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 3 Sep 2014 15:29:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

Hence, we demonstrate\nthat cellular aging is an emergent property of this model network.

The mathematical approach is based on computing the\nsensitivity of the reanalysis (unconstrained optimization solution) with\nrespect to the data. The computational cost is dominated by the solution of a\nlinear system, whose matrix is the Hessian of the cost function, and is only\navailable in operator form. The right hand side is the gradient of a scalar\ncost function that quantifies the forecast error of the numerical model. The\nuse of adjoint models to obtain the necessary first and second order\nderivatives is discussed. We study various strategies to accelerate the\ncomputation, including matrix-free iterative solvers, preconditioners, and an\nin-house multigrid solver. Experiments are conducted on both a small-size\nshallow-water equations model, and on a large-scale numerical weather\nprediction model, in order to illustrate the capabilities of the new\nmethodology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 May 2013 17:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 Jul 2013 20:32:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-22"}

Here we argue that a fully symmetric and gapped\nsurface is possible in the presence of strong interactions, if a special type\nof topological order appears on the surface. The topological order realizes T\nsymmetry in an anomalous way, one that is impossible to achieve in purely two\ndimensions.

This non-locality allows\nusers to transfer, in effect, locally accessible energy between sites of\ndifferent system components by LOCC (local operations and classical\ncommunication). Quantum energy teleportation is a three-step LOCC protocol,\naccomplished without an external energy carrier, for effectively transferring\nenergy between two physically separated, but correlated, sites. We apply this\nLOCC teleportation protocol to a model Heisenberg spin particle pair initially\nin a quantum thermal Gibbs state, making temperature an explicit parameter. We\nfind in this setting that energy teleportation is possible at any temperature,\neven at temperatures above the threshold where the particles' entanglement\nvanishes. This shows for Gibbs spin states that entanglement is not\nfundamentally necessary for energy teleportation; correlation other than\nentanglement can suffice. Dissonance---quantum correlation in separable\nstates---is in this regard shown to be a quantum resource for energy\nteleportation, more dissonance being consistently associated with greater\nenergy yield. We compare energy teleportation from particle A to B in Gibbs\nstates with direct local energy extraction by a general quantum operation on B\nand find a temperature threshold below which energy extraction by a local\noperation is impossible. This threshold delineates essentially two regimes: a\nhigh temperature regime where entanglement vanishes and the teleportation\ngenerated by other quantum correlations yields only vanishingly little energy\nrelative to local extraction and a second low-temperature teleportation regime\nwhere energy is available at B only by teleportation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 May 2013 20:19:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Aug 2013 16:04:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

The predictions of theory are in accord with the appearance\nof thermodynamic scaling for pressures not in excess of about 50 MPa. (The\nfailure at higher pressures arises due to inherent limitations of a lattice\nmodel.) In line with arguments relating the magnitude of gamma to the steepness\nof the repulsive part of the intermolecular potential, the abrupt, square-well\nnature of the lattice model interactions lead, as expected, to much larger\nvalues of the scaling exponent. Nevertheless, the theory is employed to study\nhow individual molecular parameters affect the scaling exponent in order to\nextract a molecular understanding of the information content contained in the\nexponent. The chain rigidity, cohesive energy, chain length, and the side group\nlength are all found to significantly affect the magnitude of the scaling\nexponent, and the computed trends agree well with available experiments. The\nvariations of gamma with these molecular parameters are explained by\nestablishing a correlation between the computed molecular dependence of the\nscaling exponent and the fragility. Thus, the efficiency of packing the\npolymers is established as the universal physical mechanism determining both\nthe fragility and the scaling exponent gamma.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 May 2013 01:15:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

This challenge is especially serious, and very few methods\nare available, when the data are very high in dimension. Statistical\nSignificance of Clustering (SigClust) is a recently developed cluster\nevaluation tool for high dimensional low sample size data. An important\ncomponent of the SigClust approach is the very definition of a single cluster\nas a subset of data sampled from a multivariate Gaussian distribution. The\nimplementation of SigClust requires the estimation of the eigenvalues of the\ncovariance matrix for the null multivariate Gaussian distribution. We show that\nthe original eigenvalue estimation can lead to a test that suffers from severe\ninflation of type-I error, in the important case where there are a few very\nlarge eigenvalues. This paper addresses this critical challenge using a novel\nlikelihood based soft thresholding approach to estimate these eigenvalues,\nwhich leads to a much improved SigClust.

When using such a method to predict a\nturbulent combustion in conjunction with a turbulence model, a probability\ndensity function (PDF) is required to evaluate statistical averages (e.g.,\nFavre average) of chemical quantities. The choice of the PDF is a compromise\nbetween computational costs and accuracy level. The aim of this paper is to\ninvestigate the influence of the PDF choice and its modeling aspects in the\nsimulation of non premixed turbulent combustion. Three different models are\nconsidered: the standard one, based on the choice of a beta distribution for Z\nand a Dirac distribution for C; a model employing a beta distribution for both\nZ and C; a third model obtained using a beta distribution for Z and the\nstatistical most likely distribution (SMLD) for C. The standard model, although\nwidely used, doesn't take into account the interaction between turbulence and\nchemical kinetics as well as the dependence of the progress variable not only\non its mean but also on its variance. The SMLD approach establishes a\nsystematic framework to incorporate informations from an arbitrary number of\nmoments, thus providing an improvement over conventionally employed presumed\nPDF closure models. The rational behind the choice of the three PDFs is\ndescribed in some details and the prediction capability of the corresponding\nmodels is tested versus well known test cases, namely, the Sandia flames, and a\ntest case for supersonic combustion provided by Cheng.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 May 2013 07:14:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Jan 2014 12:35:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-22"}

The\nformation of the NC structure plays an important role in the process of fission\nof higher-order N-solitons in optical fibers. After the splitting of the\ninitial N--soliton into a nonuniform chain of fundamental quasi-solitons, the\ntallest one travels along the entire chain, through consecutive collisions with\nother solitons, and then escapes, while the remaining chain of pulses stays as\na bound state, due to the radiation-mediated interaction between them.\nIncreasing the initial soliton's order, $N$, leads to the transmission through,\nand release of additional solitons with enhanced power, along with the emission\nof radiation, which may demonstrate a broadband supercontinuum spectrum. The NC\ndynamical regime remains robust in the presence of extra perturbations, such as\nthe Raman and self-steepening effects, and dispersions terms above the third\norder. It is demonstrated that essentially the same NC mechanism is induced by\nthe TOD in finite segments of periodic wavetrains (in particular, soliton\nchains). A strong difference from the mechanical NC is that the TOD-driven\npulse passing through the soliton array collects energy and momentum from other\nsolitons. Thus, uniform and non-uniforms arrays of nonlinear wave pulses offer\nan essential extension of the mechanical NC, in which the quasi-particles,\nunlike mechanical beads, interact inelastically, exchanging energy and\ngenerating radiation. Nevertheless, the characteristic phenomenology of NC\nchains may be clearly identified in these nonlinear-wave settings too.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 May 2013 11:34:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

This\nform of response was obtained as a function of the two inputs in each of the\nrealized biochemical systems. The enzymatic gate processes in the first system\nwere activated with two chemical inputs and resulted in optically detected\nchromogen oxidation, which happens when either one or both of the inputs are\npresent. In this case, the biochemical system is functioning as the OR gate. We\ndemonstrate that the addition of a \"filtering\" biocatalytic process leads to a\nconsiderable reduction of the noise transmission factor and the resulting gate\nresponse has sigmoid shape in both inputs. The second system was developed for\nfunctioning as an AND gate, where the output signal was activated only by a\nsimultaneous action of two enzymatic biomarkers. This response can be used as\nan indicator of liver damage, but only if both of these of the inputs are\npresent at their elevated, pathophysiological values of concentrations.

First we study some fundamental properties of such\ngroupoids. Then we determine certain fundamental congruences on a completely\ninverse $AG^{**}$-groupoid; namely: the maximum idempotent-separating\ncongruence, the least $AG$-group congruence and the least $E$-unitary\ncongruence. Finally, we investigate the complete lattice of congruences of a\ncompletely inverse $AG^{**}$-groupoids.
