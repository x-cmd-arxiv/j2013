A majority of\nmeta-analytic methods combine information from multiple studies by assuming\nthat studies are independent since individuals collected in one study are\nunlikely to be collected again by another study. However, it has become\nincreasingly common to utilize the same control individuals among multiple\nstudies to reduce genotyping or sequencing cost. This causes those studies that\nshare the same individuals to be dependent, and spurious associations may arise\nif overlapping subjects are not taken into account in a meta-analysis. In this\npaper, we propose a general framework for meta-analyzing dependent studies with\noverlapping subjects. Given dependent studies, our approach \"decouples\" the\nstudies into independent studies such that meta-analysis methods assuming\nindependent studies can be applied. This enables many meta-analysis methods,\nsuch as the random effects model, to account for overlapping subjects. Another\nadvantage is that one can continue to use preferred software in the analysis\npipeline which may not support overlapping subjects. Using simulations and the\nWellcome Trust Case Control Consortium data, we show that our decoupling\napproach allows both the fixed and the random effects models to account for\noverlapping subjects while retaining desirable false positive rate and power.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Apr 2013 16:01:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Oct 2013 21:53:36 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 17 Jan 2014 17:59:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-20"}

Although the Planck collaboration has\nrecently obtained tight constraints on primordial non-gaussianity from cosmic\nmicrowave background measurements, it is still worthwhile to mine upcoming data\nsets in effort to place independent or competitive limits. The ionized bubbles\nthat formed at redshift z~6-20 during the Epoch of Reionization are seeded by\nprimordial overdensities, and so the statistics of the ionization field at high\nredshift are related to the statistics of the primordial field. Here we model\nthe effect of primordial non-gaussianity on the reionization field. The epoch\nand duration of reionization are affected as are the sizes of the ionized\nbubbles, but these changes are degenerate with variations in the properties of\nthe ionizing sources and the surrounding intergalactic medium. A more promising\nsignature is the power spectrum of the spatial fluctuations in the ionization\nfield, which may be probed by upcoming 21 cm surveys. This has the expected\n1/k^2 dependence on large scales, characteristic of a biased tracer of the\nmatter field. We project how well upcoming 21 cm observations will be able to\ndisentangle this signal from foreground contamination. Although foreground\ncleaning inevitably removes the large-scale modes most impacted by primordial\nnon-gaussianity, we find that primordial non-gaussianity can be separated from\nforeground contamination for a narrow range of length scales.

A strong restriction on the noncommutative space\nresults from the first order condition which came from the requirement that the\nDirac operator is a differential operator of order one. Without this\nrestriction, invariance under inner automorphisms requires the inner\nfluctuations of the Dirac operator to contain a quadratic piece expressed in\nterms of the linear part.

In\nweak magnetic fields,the layered structure effects are shown to manifest\nthemselves in a phase retardation of power factor oscillations,increase of\ntheir relativeb contribution, and certain reduction of the power factor in\nwhole.In highmagnetic fields,there exists an optimal range,where the power\nfactor reaches its maximum,with the corresponding value calculated for the\nchosen parameters of the problem in the effective mass approximation being by\n12%higher than that for real layered crystals.Despite low temperatures,the\npower factor maximum obtained with those parameters in a magnetic field of 1T\nhas a value characteristic of cuprate thermoelectric materials at 1000K.

This relationship does not vary\nsubstantially with sunspot group latitude or with the phase of the sunspot\ncycle.

VHE \\gamma-rays were detected with a statistical significance of 9.2\nstandard deviations in 15.8 hours of H.E.S.S. data taken during March and April\n2009. A VHE integral flux of I(0.15 TeV < E < 1.0 TeV) = (1.0 +- 0.2 (stat) +-\n0.2 (sys) x 10^{-11} cm^{-2}s^{-1} is measured.

The GeV\nand optical light curves show pronounced variability during the period of\nH.E.S.S. observations. However, there is insufficient evidence to claim\nstatistically significant variability in the VHE data. Because of its\nrelatively high redshift, the VHE flux from PKS 1510-089 should suffer\nconsiderable attenuation in the intergalactic space due to the extragalactic\nbackground light (EBL). Hence, the measured \\gamma-ray spectrum is used to\nderive upper limits on the opacity due to EBL, which are found to be comparable\nwith the previously derived limits from relatively-nearby BL Lac objects.\nUnlike typical VHE-detected blazars where the broadband spectrum is dominated\nby non-thermal radiation at all wavelengths, the quasar PKS 1510-089 has a\nbright thermal component in the optical to UV frequency band. Among all VHE\ndetected blazars, PKS 1510-089 has the most luminous broad line region (BLR).\nThe detection of VHE emission from this quasar indicates a low level of\n\\gamma-\\gamma absorption on the internal optical to UV photon field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Apr 2013 17:07:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-01"}

A feature\nof such networks is that any user is typically in the range of multiple\nhelpers. Hence, in order to cope with user-helper association, load balancing\nand inter-cell interference, an efficient streaming policy should allow the\nusers to dynamically select the helper node to download from, and determine\nadaptively the video quality level of the download. In order to obtain a\ntractable formulation, we follow a \"divide and conquer\" approach: i) Assuming\nthat each video packet (chunk) is delivered within its playback delay (\"smooth\nstreaming regime\"), the problem is formulated as a network utility maximization\n(NUM), subject to queue stability, where the network utility function is a\nconcave and componentwise non-decreasing function of the users' video quality\nmeasure. ii) We solve the NUM problem by using a Lyapunov Drift Plus Penalty\napproach, obtaining a scheme that naturally decomposes into two sub-policies\nreferred to as \"congestion control\" (adaptive video quality and helper station\nselection) and \"transmission scheduling\" (dynamic allocation of the helper-user\nphysical layer transmission rates).Our solution is provably optimal with\nrespect to the proposed NUM problem, in a strong per-sample path sense. iii)\nFinally, we propose a method to adaptively estimate the maximum queuing delays,\nsuch that each user can calculate its pre-buffering and re-buffering time in\norder to cope with the fluctuations of the queuing delays.

Earlier results obtained for the AWGN\nchannel are extended to a wide class of noise densities, including unimodal and\nspherically-invariant noise. Under these broad conditions, symbol and bit error\nrates are shown to be convex functions of the SNR in the high-SNR regime with\nan explicitly-determined threshold, which depends only on the constellation\ndimensionality and minimum distance, thus enabling an application of the\npowerful tools of convex optimization to such digital communication systems in\na rigorous way. It is the decreasing nature of the noise power density around\nthe decision region boundaries that insures the convexity of symbol error rates\nin the general case. The known high/low SNR bounds of the convexity/concavity\nregions are tightened and no further improvement is shown to be possible in\ngeneral. The high SNR bound fits closely into the channel coding theorem: all\ncodes, including capacity-achieving ones, whose decision regions include the\nhardened noise spheres (from the noise sphere hardening argument in the channel\ncoding theorem) satisfies this high SNR requirement and thus has convex error\nrates in both SNR and noise power.

Three of the four methods are based on estimating\nthe scale-size of the minimum in a hypersurface formed by the weighted sum of\nthe squares of the differences between the model fit and the data as a function\nof the fit parameters, and are implemented as commonly practiced. The fourth\nmethod uses Bayesian data analysis and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)\ntechniques to calculate an uncertainty estimate. Two flare spectra are modeled:\none from the GOES X1.3 class flare of 19 January 2005, and the other from the\nX4.8 flare of 23 July 2002. The four methods give approximately the same\nuncertainty estimates for the 19 January 2005 spectral fit parameters, but lead\nto very different uncertainty estimates for the 23 July 2002 spectral fit. This\nis because each method implements different analyses of the hypersurface,\nyielding method-dependent results that differ greatly depending on the shape of\nthe hypersurface. For the 23 July 2002 flare data, there is a 95% probability\nthat the low energy cutoff lies below approximately 40 keV, and a 68%\nprobability that it lies in the range 7-36 keV. The low-energy cutoff for the\n19 January 2005 flare is more tightly constrained to 107+/-4 keV (68%\nprobability). Using the Bayesian/MCMC approach, we also estimate for the first\ntime probability density functions (PDFs) for the total number of flare\naccelerated electrons and the energy they carry. For the 23 July 2002 event,\nthese PDFs are asymmetric with long tails orders of magnitude higher than the\nmost probable value, caused by the poorly constrained value of the low-energy\ncutoff.

Such games have been used to model issues including the\nformation of opinions and the adoption of technology. A basic question that has\nremained largely open in this area is to consider games where the strategies\navailable to the players come from a fixed, discrete set, and where players may\nhave different intrinsic preferences among the possible strategies. It is\nnatural to model the tension among these different preferences by positing a\ndistance function on the strategy set that determines a notion of \"similarity\"\namong strategies; a player's payoff is determined by the distance from her\nchosen strategy to her preferred strategy and to the strategies chosen by her\nnetwork neighbors. Even when there are only two strategies available, this\nframework already leads to natural open questions about a version of the\nclassical Battle of the Sexes problem played on a graph.\n  We develop a set of techniques for analyzing this class of games, which we\nrefer to as discrete preference games. We parametrize the games by the relative\nextent to which a player takes into account the effect of her preferred\nstrategy and the effect of her neighbors' strategies, allowing us to\ninterpolate between network coordination games and unilateral decision-making.\nWhen these two effects are balanced, we show that the price of stability is\nequal to 1 for any discrete preference game in which the distance function on\nthe strategies is a tree metric; as a special case, this includes the Battle of\nthe Sexes on a graph. We also show that trees form the maximal family of\nmetrics for which the price of stability is 1, and produce a collection of\nmetrics on which the price of stability converges to a tight bound of 2.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Apr 2013 19:22:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-01"}

As a consequence, the unparticle picture proposed by\nGeorgi\\cite{georgi} is the natural candidate to describe such dynamics.\nUnparticle stuff is scale-invariant matter with no particular mass. Scale\ninvariance dictates that the propagator has an algebraic form which can admit\nzeros and hence is a candidate to explain the ubiquitous pseudogap state of the\ncuprates. The non-perturbative electronic state formed out of unparticles we\nrefer to as an un-Fermi liquid. We show that the underlying action of the\ncontinuous mass formulation of unparticles can be recast exactly as an action\nin anti de Sitter space. We find that this mapping fixes the scaling dimension\nof the unparticle to be $d_U=d/2+\\sqrt{d^2+4}/2$ and ensures that the\ncorresponding propagator has zeros with $d$ the spacetime dimension of the\nunparticle field. Should $d=2+1$, unparticles acquire the non-trivial phase\n$2\\pi d_U$ upon interchange. Because $d_U$ is non-integer and in general not\nhalf-integer, clockwise and counterclockwise interchange of unparticles do not\nlead to the same phase and time reversal symmetry is broken spontaneously as\nreported in numerous experiments in the pseudogap phase of the cuprates. The\npossible relevance of this mechanism to such experiments is discussed.

For n-player general-sum games, however, theoretical guarantees\nfor regret minimization are less understood. Nonetheless, Counterfactual Regret\nMinimization (CFR), a popular regret minimization algorithm for extensive-form\ngames, has generated winning three-player Texas Hold'em agents in the Annual\nComputer Poker Competition (ACPC). In this paper, we provide the first set of\ntheoretical properties for regret minimization algorithms in non-zero-sum games\nby proving that solutions eliminate iterative strict domination. We formally\ndefine \\emph{dominated actions} in extensive-form games, show that CFR avoids\niteratively strictly dominated actions and strategies, and demonstrate that\nremoving iteratively dominated actions is enough to win a mock tournament in a\nsmall poker game. In addition, for two-player non-zero-sum games, we bound the\nworst case performance and show that in practice, regret minimization can yield\nstrategies very close to equilibrium. Our theoretical advancements lead us to a\nnew modification of CFR for games with more than two players that is more\nefficient and may be used to generate stronger strategies than previously\npossible. Furthermore, we present a new three-player Texas Hold'em poker agent\nthat was built using CFR and a novel game decomposition method. Our new agent\nwins the three-player events of the 2012 ACPC and defeats the winning\nthree-player programs from previous competitions while requiring less resources\nto generate than the 2011 winner. Finally, we show that our CFR modification\ncomputes a strategy of equal quality to our new agent in a quarter of the time\nof standard CFR using half the memory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Apr 2013 21:54:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-02"}

It is challenging\nbecause there are typically millions of cells in a microbial sample, the vast\nmajority of which elude cultivation. The most accurate method to date is\nexhaustive single cell sequencing using multiple displacement amplification,\nwhich is simply intractable for a large number of cells. However, there is hope\nfor breaking this barrier as the number of different cell types with distinct\ngenome sequences is usually much smaller than the number of cells.\n  Here, we present a novel divide and conquer method to sequence and de novo\nassemble all distinct genomes present in a microbial sample with a sequencing\ncost and computational complexity proportional to the number of genome types,\nrather than the number of cells. The method is implemented in a tool called\nSqueezambler. We evaluated Squeezambler on simulated data. The proposed divide\nand conquer method successfully reduces the cost of sequencing in comparison\nwith the naive exhaustive approach.\n  Availability: Squeezambler and datasets are available under\nhttp://compbio.cs.wayne.edu/software/squeezambler/.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 May 2013 00:49:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 May 2013 21:39:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-29"}

Each is centered on a narrow range of black\nhole mass but spans a very broad range of Eddington ratios, effectively\nsimulating, in a statistical manner, the behavior of a single black hole\nevolving across a wide spread in accretion states. Unlike the relationship\nbetween the radio and optical luminosity, which shows an abruptly break between\nhigh- and low-luminosity sources at an Eddington ratio of ~1, the radio\nemission-a measure of the jet power-varies continuously with the hard X-ray\n(2-10 keV) luminosity, roughly as L_R \\propto L_X^(0.6-0.75). This relation,\nwhich holds for both radio-weak and radio-strong active galaxies, is similar to\nthe one seen in X-ray binaries.

For example, a snow-blower is potentially useful not\nonly to the household that buys it, but also to others on the same street.\nGiven that the seller is constrained to selling such a (locally) public good\nvia individual private sales, how should he set his prices given the\ndistribution of values held by the agents?\n  We study this problem as a two-stage game. In the first stage, the seller\nchooses and announces a price for the product. In the second stage, the agents\n(each having a private value for the good) decide simultaneously whether or not\nthey will buy the product. In the resulting game, which can exhibit a\nmultiplicity of equilibria, agents must strategize about whether they will\nthemselves purchase the good to receive its benefits.\n  In the case of a fully public good (where all agents benefit whenever any\nagent purchases), we describe a pricing mechanism that is approximately\nrevenue-optimal (up to a constant factor) when values are drawn from a regular\ndistribution. We then study settings in which the good is only \"locally\"\npublic: agents are arranged in a network and share benefits only with their\nneighbors. We describe a pricing method that approximately maximizes revenue,\nin the worst case over equilibria of agent behavior, for any $d$-regular\nnetwork. Finally, we show that approximately optimal prices can be found for\ngeneral networks in the special case that private values are drawn from a\nuniform distribution. We also discuss some barriers to extending these results\nto general networks and regular distributions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 May 2013 05:14:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-02"}

Since the\ncovariance of average velocity in double time interval and available force\nequals zero, it is possible to calculate the conditional probability\ndistribution function (CPDF) within the systems. It is found that the\nasymmetric CPDF of the velocity between two adjacent time intervals can be\nderived from the symmetrical CPDF between the available force and the double\ntime interval velocity. Two typical currency exchange databases, i.e., EUR/USD\nand GBP/USD, which collect the minutely opening exchange prices from 1 January\n1999 to 31 December 2011, are adopted as examples.

The analytical CPDF can\nbe also used to calculate the conditional expectation and the conditional\nvariance of velocity. Interestingly, the two databases show that the\nconditional expectation of the velocity between two adjacent time intervals is\nnot monotonic, while the conditional variance tends to monotonic. All of these\nresults are well described by our theory. It is worthwhile to note that the\nanalytical CPDF is a general expression.

Recent advances in inducible genetic\nlabeling provided ample evidence that symmetric stem cell divisions play an\nimportant role in adult mammalian homeostasis. It is well understood that the\ntwo types of cell divisions differ in terms of the stem cells' flexibility to\nexpand when needed. On the contrary, the implications of symmetric and\nasymmetric divisions for mutation accumulation are still poorly understood. In\nthis paper we study a stochastic model of a renewing tissue, and address the\noptimization problem of tissue architecture in the context of mutant\nproduction. Specifically, we study the process of tumor suppressor gene\ninactivation which usually takes place as a sequence of two consecutive \"hits\",\nand which is one of the most common patterns in carcinogenesis. We compare and\ncontrast symmetric and asymmetric (and mixed) stem cell divisions, and focus on\nthe rate at which double-hit mutants are generated. It turns out that\nsymmetrically-dividing cells generate such mutants at a rate which is\nsignificantly lower than that of asymmetrically-dividing cells. This result\nholds whether single-hit (intermediate) mutants are disadvantageous, neutral,\nor advantageous. It is also independent on whether the carcinogenic double-hit\nmutants are produced only among the stem cells or also among more\ndifferentiated cells. We argue that symmetric stem cell divisions in mammals\ncould be an adaptation which helps delay the onset of cancers.

How and\nwhy does mortality change generate this diversity? We derive a precise link\nbetween changes in age-specific mortality and lifespan inequality, measured as\nthe variance of age at death. Key to this relationship is a young-old threshold\nage, below and above which mortality decline respectively decreases and\nincreases lifespan inequality. First, we show that shifts in the threshold's\nlocation modified the correlation between changes in life expectancy and\nlifespan inequality over the last two centuries. Second, we analyze the post\nSecond World War trajectories of lifespan inequality in a set of developed\ncountries, Japan, Canada and the United States (US), where thresholds centered\non retirement age. Our method reveals how divergence in the age-pattern of\nmortality change drives international divergence in lifespan inequality. Most\nstrikingly, early in the 1980s, mortality increases in young US males led\nlifespan inequality to remain high in the US, while in Canada the decline of\ninequality continued. In general, our wider international comparisons show that\nmortality change varied most at young working ages after the Second World War,\nparticularly for males. We conclude that if mortality continues to stagnate at\nyoung ages, yet declines steadily at old ages, increases in lifespan inequality\nwill become a common feature of future demographic change.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 May 2013 07:46:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 Nov 2013 08:20:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-22"}

We show that the dynamic processes leading to the\ntransient maintenance of biodiversity are closely linked to attractors of the\nnonlinear dynamics for the overall species' concentrations. The characteristics\nof these global attractors change qualitatively at certain threshold values of\nthe mobility, and depend on the relative strength of the different types of\ncompetition between species.

The global attractors then correspond to minima of\nthis effective energy landscape and determine the most probable values for the\nspecies' global concentrations. As in equilibrium thermodynamics, qualitative\nchanges in the effective free energy landscape indicate and characterize the\nunderlying non-equilibrium phase transitions.

In the absence of spin-orbit coupling, the Bi-Rh sheets\nshow two inequivalent Dirac cones at the corners of the hexagonal Brillouin\nzone. The spin-orbit interaction opens a 2400 K bandgap at the Dirac points and\nestablishes the quantum spin Hall effect in the Bi-Rh sheets. Our result\nindicates that the Bi14Rh3I9 may combine many unique electronic properties of\ngraphene and topological insulators, and it should host a combination of\nquantum valley and spin Hall effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 May 2013 08:29:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 4 May 2013 08:09:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-07"}

The three-valued semantics proposed by\nFitting and by Kunen are closely related to what is computed by a logic\nprogram, the third truth value being associated with non-termination. A\ndifferent three-valued semantics, proposed by Naish, shared much with those of\nFitting and Kunen but incorporated allowances for programmer intent, the third\ntruth value being associated with underspecification. Naish used an\n(apparently) novel \"arrow\" operator to relate the intended meaning of left and\nright sides of predicate definitions. In this paper we suggest that the\nadditional truth values of Fitting/Kunen and Naish are best viewed as duals. We\nuse Belnap's four-valued logic, also used elsewhere by Fitting, to unify the\ntwo three-valued approaches. The truth values are arranged in a bilattice which\nsupports the classical ordering on truth values as well as the \"information\nordering\". We note that the \"arrow\" operator of Naish (and our four-valued\nextension) is essentially the information ordering, whereas the classical arrow\ndenotes the truth ordering.

The combination of the\ncontrol techniques and the favorable coherent properties of NV centers provides\nan excellent experimental platform to study a variety of quantum dynamical\nphenomena.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 May 2013 12:43:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-09"}

Relatively\nlittle attention has been paid to compressing the quality scores that are\nassigned to each sequence, even though these scores may be harder to compress\nthan the sequences themselves. By aggregating a set of reads into a compressed\nindex, we find that the majority of bases can be predicted from the sequence of\nbases that are adjacent to them and hence are likely to be less informative for\nvariant calling or other applications. The quality scores for such bases are\naggressively compressed, leaving a relatively small number at full resolution.\nSince our approach relies directly on redundancy present in the reads, it does\nnot need a reference sequence and is therefore applicable to data from\nmetagenomics and de novo experiments as well as to resequencing data.\n  Results:\n  We show that a conservative smoothing strategy affecting 75% of the quality\nscores above Q2 leads to an overall quality score compression of 1 bit per\nvalue with a negligible effect on variant calling. A compression of 0.68 bit\nper quality value is achieved using a more aggressive smoothing strategy, again\nwith a very small effect on variant calling.\n  Availability:\n  Code to construct the BWT and LCP-array on large genomic data sets is part of\nthe BEETL library, available as a github respository at\nhttp://git@github.com:BEETL/BEETL.git .\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 May 2013 12:51:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-02"}

This Jeans filtering scale\nhas fundamental cosmological implications: it provides a thermal record of heat\ninjected by UV photons during reionization events, determines the clumpiness of\nthe IGM, and sets the minimum mass scale for gravitational collapse, a key\nquantity in galaxy formation. Unfortunately, it is extremely challenging to\nmeasure via the standard analysis of purely longitudinal Lyman-alpha forest\nspectra, because the thermal Doppler broadening of absorption lines is highly\ndegenerate with Jeans pressure smoothing. In this work we show that the Jeans\nscale can be directly measured by characterizing the coherence of correlated\nLyman-alpha absorption in quasar pairs with separations small enough to resolve\nit. We present a novel technique for this purpose, based on the probability\ndistribution function (PDF) of phase angle differences of homologous\nlongitudinal Fourier modes in close quasar pair spectra. A Bayesian formalism\nis introduced based on the phase angle PDF, and MCMC techniques are used to\ncharacterize the precision of a future Jeans scale measurement, and explore\ndegeneracies with other thermal parameters governing the IGM. A semi-analytical\nmodel of the IGM is used to generate a grid of 500 thermal models from a dark\nmatter simulation. Our full parameter study indicates that a realistic sample\nof only 20 close quasar pair spectra can pinpoint the Jeans scale to ~ 5%\nprecision, independent of the parameters governing the temperature-density\nrelation of the IGM.
