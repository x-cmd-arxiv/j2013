While an arbitrary signal cannot be recovered in the\nface of arbitrary corruption, tractable recovery is possible when both signal\nand corruption are suitably structured. We quantify the relationship between\nsignal recovery and two geometric measures of structure, the Gaussian\ncomplexity of a tangent cone and the Gaussian distance to a subdifferential. We\ntake a convex programming approach to disentangling signal and corruption,\nanalyzing both penalized programs that trade off between signal and corruption\ncomplexity, and constrained programs that bound the complexity of signal or\ncorruption when prior information is available. In each case, we provide\nconditions for exact signal recovery from structured corruption and stable\nsignal recovery from structured corruption with added unstructured noise. Our\nsimulations demonstrate close agreement between our theoretical recovery bounds\nand the sharp phase transitions observed in practice. In addition, we provide\nnew interpretable bounds for the Gaussian complexity of sparse vectors,\nblock-sparse vectors, and low-rank matrices, which lead to sharper guarantees\nof recovery when combined with our results and those in the literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 May 2013 16:01:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 Feb 2014 17:43:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-05"}

In a number of cases, the optical and X-ray emission of jet regions\nare inked by a single spectral component, and in those, high- resolution\nmulti-band imaging and polarimetry can be combined to yield a powerful\ndiagnostic of jet emission processes.

I show how\nthese extremely strong fields are actually weak in terms of their effects on\nthe stellar structure, as is also the case for magnetic stars on the upper main\nsequence and magnetic white dwarfs, which have similar total magnetic fluxes. I\npropose a scenario in which a stable hydromagnetic equilibrium (containing a\npoloidal and a toroidal field component) is established soon after the birth of\nthe neutron star, aided by the strong compositional stratification of neutron\nstar matter, and this state is slowly eroded by non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic\nprocesses such as beta decays and ambipolar diffusion in the core of the star\nand Hall drift and breaking of the solid in its crust. Over sufficiently long\ntime scales, the fluid in the neutron star core will behave as if it were\nbarotropic, because, depending on temperature and magnetic field strength, beta\ndecays will keep adjusting the composition to the chemical equilibrium state,\nor ambipolar diffusion will decouple the charged component from the neutrons.\nTherefore, the still open question regarding stable hydromagnetic equilibria in\nbarotropic fluids will become relevant for the evolution, at least for\n``magnetar'' fields, too strong to be stabilized by the solid crust.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 May 2013 20:45:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-14"}

In many of these application domains the learner may be\nconstrained by one or more supply (or budget) limits, in addition to the\ncustomary limitation on the time horizon. The literature lacks a general model\nencompassing these sorts of problems. We introduce such a model, called\n\"bandits with knapsacks\", that combines aspects of stochastic integer\nprogramming with online learning. A distinctive feature of our problem, in\ncomparison to the existing regret-minimization literature, is that the optimal\npolicy for a given latent distribution may significantly outperform the policy\nthat plays the optimal fixed arm. Consequently, achieving sublinear regret in\nthe bandits-with-knapsacks problem is significantly more challenging than in\nconventional bandit problems.\n  We present two algorithms whose reward is close to the information-theoretic\noptimum: one is based on a novel \"balanced exploration\" paradigm, while the\nother is a primal-dual algorithm that uses multiplicative updates. Further, we\nprove that the regret achieved by both algorithms is optimal up to\npolylogarithmic factors. We illustrate the generality of the problem by\npresenting applications in a number of different domains including electronic\ncommerce, routing, and scheduling. As one example of a concrete application, we\nconsider the problem of dynamic posted pricing with limited supply and obtain\nthe first algorithm whose regret, with respect to the optimal dynamic policy,\nis sublinear in the supply.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 May 2013 21:50:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 30 Jun 2013 21:13:51 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 15 Aug 2013 13:52:46 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 20 Oct 2014 19:24:09 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 24 Jun 2015 16:43:30 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Fri, 31 Jul 2015 18:36:51 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Sat, 17 Jun 2017 18:59:24 GMT"},{"version":"v8","created":"Tue, 5 Sep 2017 14:00:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-06"}

Strong physical uncloneable function (SPUF) encryption key means that\neven the manufacturer of the hardware is unable to clone the key. In this\npaper, first we introduce a \"ultra\"-strong PUF with intrinsic dynamical\nrandomness, which is not only not cloneable but it also gets renewed to an\nindependent key (with fresh randomness) during each use via the unconditionally\nsecure key exchange. The solution utilizes the Kirchhoff-law-Johnson-noise\n(KLJN) method for dynamical key renewal and a one-time-pad secure key for the\nchallenge/response process. The secure key is stored in a flash memory on the\nchip to provide tamper-resistance and non-volatile storage with zero power\nrequirements in standby mode. Simplified PUF keys are shown: a strong PUF\nutilizing KLJN protocol during the first run and noise-based logic (NBL)\nhyperspace vector string verification method for the challenge/response during\nthe rest of its life or until it is re-initialized. Finally, the simplest PUF\nutilizes NBL without KLJN thus it can be cloned by the manufacturer but not by\nanybody else.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 May 2013 02:51:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 May 2013 11:35:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 26 Jul 2013 23:27:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-18"}
