When two-component (i.e. stellar plus dark) mass\nmodels are fitted to the SDSS aperture velocity dispersions, the predicted\nvelocity dispersion profile (VP) slopes within the effective radius R_eff match\nwell the distribution in observed elliptical galaxies. In contrast, the\nsingle-component models cannot reproduce the VP slope distribution. From a\nnumber of input variations the models exhibit for the radial range 0.1 R_eff <\nr < R_eff a tight correlation <gamma_e>=(1.865+/-0.008)+(-4.93+/-0.15)<eta>\nwhere <gamma_e> is the mean slope absolute value of the total mass density and\n<eta> is the mean slope of the velocity dispersion profile, which leads to a\nsuper-isothermal <gamma_e> = 2.15+/-0.04 for <eta>=-0.058+/-0.008 in observed\nelliptical galaxies. Furthermore, the successful two-component models appear to\nimply a typical slope curvature pattern in the total mass profile because for\nthe observed steep luminosity (stellar mass) profile and the weak lensing\ninferred halo profile at large radii a total mass profile with monotonically\nvarying slope would require too high DM density in the optical region giving\nrise to too large aperture velocity dispersion and too shallow VP.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 May 2013 16:02:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Oct 2013 07:58:26 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 7 Nov 2013 09:22:11 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 8 Nov 2013 05:41:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

For multi-dimensional simulations of neutral gas flows, the\ncell-centered version of this semi-Lagrangian (CCSL) scheme has advantages over\nother options due to its implementation simplicity, low memory requirements,\nand easier treatment of boundary conditions. The main drawback of the CCSL-CS\nto date has been its high numerical diffusion in physical space, because of the\n2$^{\\text{nd}}$ order remapping that takes place at the end of each time step.\nBy means of a Modified Equation Analysis, it is shown that a high order\nestimate of the remapping error can be obtained a priori, and a small\ncorrection to the final position of the cells can be applied upon remapping, in\norder to achieve full compensation of this error.

These results highlight the considerable uncertainty\nthat exists in measurements of the dark matter content of Ursa Major II. The\ndynamics of the inner tidal tails, and tidal stream, causes the observed\nvelocity dispersion of stars to be boosted to values of $>$5 km s$^{-1}$ ($>$20\nkm s$^{-1}$ at times). This effect is responsible for raising the velocity\ndispersion of our model to the observed values in UMaII.

This paper\nexamines the occurrence of such \"macro-turbulence\" in slowly rotating O-stars\nwith strong, organised surface magnetic fields. Focusing on the CIV 5811A line,\nwe find evidence for significant macro-turbulent broadening in all stars except\nNGC1624-2, which also has (by far) the strongest magnetic field. Instead, the\nvery sharp CIV lines in NGC1624-2 are dominated by magnetic Zeeman broadening,\nfrom which we estimate a dipolar field of approximately 20 kG. By contrast,\nmagnetic broadening is negligible in the other stars (due to their weaker field\nstrengths, on order 1 kG), and their CIV profiles are typically very broad and\nsimilar to corresponding lines observed in non-magnetic O-stars. Quantifying\nthis by an isotropic, Gaussian macro-turbulence, we derive vmac = 2.2 (+-\n0.9/2.2) km/s for NGC1624-2, and vmac = 20-65 km/s for the rest of the magnetic\nsample. We use these observational results to test the hypothesis that the\nfield can stabilise the atmosphere and suppress the generation of\nmacro-turbulence down to stellar layers where the magnetic pressure PB and the\ngas pressure Pg are comparable. Using a simple grey atmosphere to estimate the\ntemperature T0 at which PB = Pg, we find that T0 > Teff for all investigated\nmagnetic stars, but that T0 reaches the ~160000 K layers associated with the\niron opacity-bump in hot stars only for NGC1624-2. This is consistent with the\nview that the responsible physical mechanism for photospheric O-star\nmacro-turbulence may be stellar gravity-mode oscillations excited by\nsub-surface convection zones, and suggests that a sufficiently strong magnetic\nfield can suppress such iron-bump generated convection and associated\npulsational excitation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 May 2013 20:04:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

Previous reports have shown\nthat an axial magnetic field induces flux-periodic conductance oscillations\nwhen the electronic states are confined to a shell. This effect is due to the\ncoupling of orbital angular momentum to the magnetic flux. Here, we perform\ncalculations of the energy level structure, and consequently the conductance,\nfor more general cases ranging from a flat potential to strong surface band\nbending. The transverse states are not confined to a shell, but are distributed\nacross the nanowire. It is found that, in general, the subband energy spectrum\nis aperiodic as a function of both gate voltage and magnetic field. In\nprinciple, this allows for precise identification of the occupied subbands from\nthe magnetoconductance patterns of quasi-ballistic devices. The aperiodicity\nbecomes more apparent as the potential flattens. A quantitative method is\nintroduced for matching features in the conductance data to the subband\nstructure resulting from a particular radial potential, where a functional form\nfor the potential is used that depends on two free parameters. Finally, a\nshort-channel InAs nanowire FET device is measured at low temperature in search\nof conductance features that reveal the subband structure. Features are\nidentified and shown to be consistent with three specific subbands. The\nexperiment is analyzed in the context of the weak localization regime, however,\nwe find that the subband effects predicted for ballistic transport should\nremain visible when back scattering dominates over interband scattering, as is\nexpected for this device.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 May 2013 20:11:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 14 May 2014 19:45:16 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 17 Nov 2014 18:42:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-22"}

We also used Keck to conduct spectroscopic\nsearches for CN emission as well as absorption at 0.7 microns that could\nindicate the presence of hydrated minerals, finding an upper limit CN\nproduction rate of QCN<1.5x10^23 mol/s, from which we infer a water production\nrate of QH2O<5x10^25 mol/s, and no evidence of the presence of hydrated\nminerals. Numerical simulations indicate that P/2012 T1 is largely dynamically\nstable for >100 Myr and is unlikely to be a recently implanted interloper from\nthe outer solar system, while a search for potential asteroid family\nassociations reveal that it is dynamically linked to the ~155 Myr-old Lixiaohua\nasteroid family.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 May 2013 20:29:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

Rather than\nbeing confined within the circularizing radius, the disk can spread to larger\nradii to conserve angular momentum. A spreading disk is a source of matter for\nre-accretion at rates which can exceed the later stellar fallback rate,\nalthough a disk wind can suppress its contribution to the central black hole\naccretion rate. A spreading disk is detectible through a break in the central\naccretion rate history, or, at longer wavelengths, by its own emission. We\nmodel the evolution of TDE disk size and accretion rate, by accounting for the\ntime-dependent fallback rate, for the influence of wind losses in the early,\nadvective stage, and for the possibility of thermal instability for accretion\nrates intermediate between the advection-dominated and gas-pressure dominated\nstates. The model provides a dynamic basis for modeling TDE light curves. All\nor part of a young TDE disk will precess as a solid body due to Lense-Thirring\neffect, and precession may manifest itself as quasi-periodic modulation of\nlight curve. The precession period increases with time. Applying our results to\nthe jetted TDE candidate Swift J1644+57, whose X-ray light curve shows numerous\nquasi-periodic dips, we argue that the data best fit a scenario in which a\nmain-sequence star was fully disrupted by an intermediate mass black hole on an\norbit significantly inclined from the black hole equator, with the apparent jet\nshutoff at t= 500 d corresponding to a disk transition from the advective state\nto the gas-pressure dominated state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 May 2013 21:22:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Jan 2014 23:18:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-11"}

We\ninvestigate the joint optimization of this technique - referred to in 3GPP as\nenhanced intercell interference coordination (eICIC) via almost blank subframes\n(ABSs) - with offloading in this paper. Although the joint cell association and\nblank resource (BR) problem is nominally combinatorial, by allowing users to\nassociate with multiple base stations (BSs), the problem becomes convex, and\nupper bounds the performance versus a binary association. We show both\ntheoretically and through simulation that the optimal solution of the relaxed\nproblem still results in an association that is mostly binary.

The proposed algorithms are modifications of the Diversity\nBackpressure (DIVBAR) algorithm, under which the packet whose commodity has the\nlargest \"backpressure metric\" is chosen to be transmitted and is forwarded\nthrough the link with the largest differential backlog (queue length). In\ncontrast to traditional DIVBAR, each receiving node stores and accumulates the\npartially received packet in a separate \"partial packet queue\", thus increasing\nthe probability of successful reception during a later possible retransmission.\nWe present two variants of the algorithm: DIVBAR-RMIA, under which all the\nreceiving nodes clear the received partial information of a packet once one or\nmore receiving nodes firstly decode the packet; and DIVBAR-MIA, under which all\nthe receiving nodes retain the partial information of a packet until the packet\nhas reached its destination. We characterize the network capacity region with\nRMIA and prove that (under certain mild conditions) it is strictly larger than\nthe network capacity region with the repetition (REP) transmission scheme that\nis used by the traditional DIVBAR. We also prove that DIVBAR-RMIA is\nthroughput-optimum among the polices with RMIA, i.e., it achieves the network\ncapacity region with RMIA, which in turn demonstrates that DIVBAR-RMIA\noutperforms traditional DIVBAR on the achievable throughput. Moreover, we prove\nthat DIVBAR-MIA performs at least as well as DIVBAR-RMIA with respect to\nthroughput.

This correlates in time with the microwave emission, indicating a\nphysical link between the flare magnetic reconnection and the acceleration of\nnonthermal particles.

In atomic systems, where interactions\nrequire wave function overlap, effective spin interactions on a lattice can be\nrealized via superexchange; however, the coupling is weak and limited to\nnearest-neighbor interactions. In contrast, dipolar interactions exist in the\nabsence of tunneling and extend beyond nearest neighbors. This allows coherent\nspin dynamics to persist even at high entropy and low lattice filling. Effects\nof dipolar interactions in ultracold molecular gases have so far been limited\nto the modification of chemical reactions. We now report the observation of\ndipolar interactions of polar molecules pinned in a 3D optical lattice. We\nrealize a lattice spin model with spin encoded in rotational states, prepared\nand probed by microwaves. This spin-exchange interaction arises from the\nresonant exchange of rotational angular momentum between two molecules. We\nobserve clear oscillations in the evolution of the spin coherence in addition\nto an overall decay. The frequency of these oscillations, the strong dependence\nof the spin coherence time on the lattice filling, and the effect of a\nmulti-pulse sequence designed to reverse dynamics due to two-body exchange\ninteractions all provide evidence of dipolar interactions. We also demonstrate\nsuppression of loss in weak lattices due to a quantum Zeno mechanism.\nMeasurements of these tunneling-induced losses allow us to independently\ndetermine the lattice filling factor. These results comprise an initial\nexploration of the behavior of many-body spin models with direct, long-range\nspin interactions and lay the groundwork for future studies of many-body\ndynamics in spin lattices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 May 2013 01:33:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-09"}

We find that the plateau of the\nsideband spectrum strongly depends on the detuning between the NIR laser field\nand the band gap. We use the quantum trajectory theory (three-step model) to\nunderstand the HSG. In the three-step model, an electron-hole pair is first\nexcited by a weak laser, then driven by the strong THz field, and finally\nrecombine to emit a photon with energy gain. When the laser is tuned below the\nband gap (negative detuning), the electron-hole generation is a virtual process\nthat requires quantum tunneling to occur. When the energy gained by the\nelectron-hole pair from the THz field is less than 3.2 times the ponderomotive\nenergy, the electron and the hole can be driven to the same position and\nrecombine without quantum tunneling, so the HSG will have large probability\namplitude. This leads to a plateau feature of the HSG spectrum with a\nhigh-frequency cutoff at about 3.2 times the ponderomotive energy above the\nband gap. Such a plateau feature is similar to the case of high-order harmonics\ngeneration in atoms where electrons have to overcome the binding energy to\nescape the atomic core. A particularly interesting excitation condition in HSG\nis that the laser can be tuned above the band gap (positive detuning),\ncorresponding to the unphysical \"negative\" binding energy in atoms for\nhigh-order harmonic generation.

The IDV observations of\n1156+295 were carried out nearly monthly from October 2007 to October 2009,\nwith the Urumqi 25m radio telescope at 4.8 GHz. The source has shown prominent\nIDV of total flux density in most observing sessions with variability\ntimescales of <= 1 day at 4.8 GHz. The estimated IDV timescales seem to follow\nan annual cycle that can be fitted with an anisotropic interstellar\nscintillation (ISS) model suggesting that a significant part of the flux\ndensity variations is due to ISS. The source underwent a dramatic flare in\n2008. We studied the possible consequences of the flare on the IDV of 1156+295\nby comparing the changes in its IDV characteristics with the evolution of the\n43 GHz Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) core size of the source. Conclusions:\nThe quasar 1156+295 shows evidence for an annual modulation of its IDV\ntimescales at 4.8 GHz, the ISS-induced IDV timescales and variability strength\nmight be affected by the overall activity state of the source core. More\nfrequent IDV and VLBI measurements are required to confirm the relation between\nthe IDV appearance and the core-size evolution of the source.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 May 2013 04:36:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 Jul 2013 11:36:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-04"}

This is generally\nderived employing a collisional MHD model. However, in the ICM the ion mean\nfree path between collisions is of the order of the dynamical scales, thus\nrequiring a collisionless MHD description. Unlike collisional MHD simulations,\nour study uses an anisotropic plasma pressure with respect to the direction of\nthe local magnetic field, which brings the plasma within a parameter space\nwhere collisionless instabilities should take place. Within the adopted model\nthese instabilities are contained at bay through the relaxation term of the\npressure anisotropy which simulates the feedback of the mirror and firehose\ninstabilities. This relaxation acts to get the plasma distribution function\nconsistent with the empirical studies of collisionless plasmas. Our 3D\nnumerical simulations of forced transonic turbulence motivated by modeling of\nthe turbulent ICM are performed for different initial values of the magnetic\nfield intensity, and different relaxation rates of the pressure anisotropy. We\nfound that in the high beta plasma regime corresponding to the ICM conditions,\na fast anisotropy relaxation rate gives results which are similar to the\ncollisional-MHD model as far as the statistical properties of the turbulence\nare concerned. Also, the amplification of seed magnetic fields due to the\nturbulent dynamo action is similar to the collisional-MHD model. Our\nsimulations that do not employ the anisotropy relaxation deviate significantly\nfrom the collisional-MHD results, and show more power at the small-scale\nfluctuations of both density and velocity representing the results of the\ninstabilities. For these simulations the large scale fluctuations in the\nmagnetic field are mostly suppressed and the turbulent dynamo fails in\namplifying seed magnetic fields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 May 2013 08:54:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

The generated alerts were compared with the daily\nroutine practice of pharmacists as part of the analysis of medication orders.\nMaterials and Methods: The pharmacists performed their analysis of medication\norders as usual and were not aware of the alert system interventions that were\nnot displayed for the purpose of the study neither to the physician nor to the\npharmacist but kept with associate recommendations in a log file. A senior\npharmacist analyzed the results of medication order analysis with and without\nthe alert system. The unit of analysis was the drug prescription line. The\nprimary study endpoints were the detection of drug-dose prescription errors and\ninter-rater reliability between the alert system and the pharmacists in the\ndetection of drug dose error. Results: The alert system fired alerts in 8.41%\n(421/5006) of cases: 5.65% (283/5006) exceeds max daily dose alerts and 2.76%\n(138/5006) under dose alerts.

In the SM, implied by\nthe hierarchical structure of the CKM matrix and the GIM mechanism, flavour\nchanging neutral current processes are most strongly suppressed in the kaon\nsector while the suppression is much less effective in the B meson systems.\nThus their theoretical cleanness makes rare K decays, in particular the K -> pi\nnu anti-nu system, extremely well suited to look for deviations from their tiny\nSM values. Despite the increasingly stringent constraints on new physics from\ndirect search experiments as well as indirect searches in B meson decays, large\nenhancements of both K^+ -> pi^+ nu anti-nu and K_L -> pi^0 nu anti-nu are\nstill possible, and deviations from the SM could be observed even for a\nmulti-TeV new physics scale. In addition the correlation betweeen the charged\nand neutral K -> pi nu anti-nu modes provides insight on the new physics\noperator structure in K^0 - anti-K^0 mixing and its interplay with rare K\ndecays. Useful model-discriminating correlations exist also in the K_L -> pi^0\nl^+ l^- system. Finally the K -> l nu decays provide a clean test of lepton\nuniversality and place constraints on new physics complementary to the ones\nobtained from the searches for charged lepton flavour violating decays.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 May 2013 09:53:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-27"}

In the dead zone, the effective viscosity is greatly reduced due to\nthe disc self-shielding against stellar UV radiation, X-rays from the stellar\nmagnetosphere and interstellar cosmic rays. As a consequence, mass accumulation\noccurs near the outer dead zone edge, which is assumed to trap planetary cores\nenhancing the efficiency of the core-accretion scenario to form giant planets.\nContrary to the perfect trapping of planetary cores in 1D models, our 2D\nnumerical simulations show that the trapping effect is greatly dependent on the\nwidth of the region where viscosity reduction is taking place. Planet trapping\nhappens exclusively if the viscosity reduction is sharp enough to allow the\ndevelopment of large-scale vortices due to the Rossby wave instability. The\ntrapping is only temporarily, and its duration is inversely proportional to the\nwidth of the viscosity transition. However, if the Rossby wave instability is\nnot excited, a ring-like axisymmetric density jump forms, which cannot trap the\n10 Earth-mass planetary cores. We revealed that the stellar torque exerted on\nthe planet plays an important role in the migration history as the barycentre\nof the system significantly shifts away from the star due to highly\nnon-axisymmetric density distribution of the disc.

In most cases, determining the\nsource intensity changes between exposures is largely based on a priori\ninformation. We propose techniques that help to overcome the difficulty related\nto source intensity variations, which make this step more rational. In\naddition, the constructed \"synthetic\" light curves should permit us to obtain a\nsky model that describes the data better and optimizes the source\nsignal-to-noise ratios. For this purpose, the time intensity variation of each\nsource was modeled as a combination of piecewise segments of time during which\na given source exhibits a constant intensity. To optimize the signal-to-noise\nratios, the number of segments was minimized. We present a first method that\ntakes advantage of previous time series that can be obtained from another\ninstrument on-board the INTEGRAL observatory. A data segmentation algorithm was\nthen used to synthesize the time series into segments. The second method no\nlonger needs external light curves, but solely SPI raw data. For this, we\ndeveloped a specific algorithm that involves the SPI transfer function. The\ntime segmentation algorithms that were developed solve a difficulty inherent to\nthe SPI instrument, which is the intensity variations of sources between\nexposures, and it allows us to obtain more information about the sources'\nbehavior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 May 2013 11:30:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

This paper discusses an approximation of the\nlikelihood in these models that can greatly facilitate computation. The basic\nidea is to replace a sum that appears in the exact log-likelihood by an\nexpectation over the model covariates; the resulting \"expected log-likelihood\"\ncan in many cases be computed significantly faster than the exact\nlog-likelihood. In many neuroscience experiments the distribution over model\ncovariates is controlled by the experimenter and the expected log-likelihood\napproximation becomes particularly useful; for example, estimators based on\nmaximizing this expected log-likelihood (or a penalized version thereof) can\noften be obtained with orders of magnitude computational savings compared to\nthe exact maximum likelihood estimators. A risk analysis establishes that these\nmaximum EL estimators often come with little cost in accuracy (and in some\ncases even improved accuracy) compared to standard maximum likelihood\nestimates. Finally, we find that these methods can significantly decrease the\ncomputation time of marginal likelihood calculations for model selection and of\nMarkov chain Monte Carlo methods for sampling from the posterior parameter\ndistribution.

The sensitivity of such searches is often critically limited by\nnon-Gaussian noise fluctuations which are difficult to distinguish from real\nsignals, posing a key problem for transient gravitational-wave astronomy.\nCurrent noise rejection tests are based on the analysis of a relatively small\nnumber of measured properties of the candidate signal, typically correlations\nbetween detectors. Multivariate analysis (MVA) techniques probe the full space\nof measured properties of events in an attempt to maximise the power to\naccurately classify events as signal or background. This is done by taking\nsamples of known background events and (simulated) signal events to train the\nMVA classifier, which can then be applied to classify events of unknown type.\nWe apply the boosted decision tree (BDT) MVA technique to the problem of\ndetecting gravitational-wave bursts associated with gamma-ray bursts.

We analyzed periods\nbetween 1 and 30 days in eight consecutive Kepler quarters, where 30 days is an\nestimated maximum for the validity of the PDC_MAP data correction pipeline. We\nselected stable rotation periods, i.e., periods that do not vary from the\nmedian by more than one day in at least six of the eight quarters. We averaged\nthe periods for each stellar spectral class according to B - V color and\ncompared the results to archival vsini data, using stellar radii estimates from\nthe Kepler Input Catalog.\n  Results: We report on the stable starspot rotation periods of 12 151 Kepler\nstars. We find good agreement between starspot velocities and vsini data for\nall F-, G- and early K-type stars. The 795 M-type stars in our sample have a\nmedian rotation period of 15.4 days. We find an excess of M-type stars with\nperiods less than 7.5 days that are potentially fast-rotating and fully\nconvective.

LDHMMs posit that each sequence is generated by an underlying\nMarkov chain process, which are controlled by the corresponding parameters\n(i.e., the initial state vector, transition matrix and the emission matrix).\nThese sequence-level latent parameters for each sequence are modeled as latent\nDirichlet random variables and parameterized by a set of deterministic\ndatabase-level hyper-parameters. Through this way, we expect to model the\nsequence in two levels: the database level by deterministic hyper-parameters\nand the sequence-level by latent parameters. To learn the deterministic\nhyper-parameters and approximate posteriors of parameters in LDHMMs, we propose\nan iterative algorithm under the variational EM framework, which consists of E\nand M steps. We examine two different schemes, the fully-factorized and\npartially-factorized forms, for the framework, based on different assumptions.\nWe present empirical results of behavior modeling and sequence classification\non three real-world data sets, and compare them to other related models.

However the halo similarity is affected by\nthe baryonic feedback, the momentum injected by the supernovae re-shape the\ndark matter core and transform it to a flat density core, with a scale length\nimposed by the baryonic feedback. Additionally the baryon feedback impose also\nan equilibrium condition, which when coupled with the imposed baryonic scale\nlength induce a new type of similarity. The new self similar solution implies\nthat the acceleration generated by dark matter is scale free, which in turns\nimplies that the baryonic acceleration at a reference radius is also scale\nfree. Constant dark matter and baryonic accelerations at a reference radius\nhave effectively been observed for a large class of different galaxies, which\nis in support of this approach. The new self similar properties implies that\nthe total acceleration at larger distances is scale free, the transition\nbetween the dark matter and baryons dominated regime occurs at a constant\nacceleration, and the maximum of the velocity curve which defines the amplitude\nof the velocity curve at larger distances is proportional to $M^{\\frac{1}{4}}$.\nThese results demonstrates that in this self similar model, cold dark matter is\nconsistent with the basics of MOND phenomenology for the galaxies.

They are precious for simplifying gradient images or,\nfilling unwanted catchment basins, on which a subsequent watershed transform\nextracts the targeted objects. Flooding a topographic surface may be modeled as\nflooding a node weighted graph (TG), with unweighted edges, the node weights\nrepresenting the ground level. The progression of a flooding may also be\nmodeled on the region adjacency graph (RAG) of a topographic surface. On a RAG\neach node represents a catchment basin and edges connect neighboring nodes. The\nedges are weighted by the altitude of the pass point between both adjacent\nregions. The graph is flooded from sources placed at the marker positions and\neach node is assigned to the source by which it has been flooded. The level of\nthe flood is represented on the nodes on each type of graphs. The same flooding\nmay thus be modeled on a TG or on a RAG. We characterize all valid floodings on\nboth types of graphs, as they should verify the laws of hydrostatics. We then\nshow that each flooding of a node weighted graph also is a flooding of an edge\nweighted graph with appropriate edge weights. The highest flooding under a\nceiling function may be interpreted as the shortest distance to the root for\nthe ultrametric flooding distance in an augmented graph. The ultrametric\ndistance between two nodes is the minimal altitude of a flooding for which both\nnodes are flooded. This remark permits to flood edge or node weighted graphs by\nusing shortest path algorithms. It appears that the collection of all lakes of\na RAG has the structure of a dendrogram, on which the highest flooding under a\nceiling function may be rapidly found.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 May 2013 14:47:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-27"}

A mechanism for the stimulated\none-photon radiative association of a pair of ultracold polar molecules into\nultracold tetramers is proposed, which would open the way towards the optical\nmanipulation of ultracold polyatomic molecules.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 May 2013 15:31:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 9 Aug 2013 08:12:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-11"}

Existing computational methods used to optimize solar cell efficiency\nunder incoherent light are based on multiple time-consuming runs and\nstatistical averaging. These indirect methods show limitations related to the\ncomplexity of the solar cell structure. As a consequence, complex corrugated\ncells, which exploit light trapping for enhancing the efficiency, have not yet\nbeen accessible for optimization under incoherent light. To overcome this\nbottleneck, we developed an original direct method which has the key advantage\nthat the treatment of incoherence can be totally decoupled from the complexity\nof the cell. As an illustration, surface corrugated GaAs and c-Si thin-films\nare considered. The spectrally integrated absorption in these devices is found\nto depend strongly on the degree of light coherence and, accordingly, the\nmaximum achievable photocurrent can be higher under incoherent light than under\ncoherent light. These results show the importance of taking into account\nsunlight incoherence in solar cell optimization and point out the ability of\nour direct method in dealing with complex solar cells structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 May 2013 15:40:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 Dec 2013 15:39:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-16"}

The review is meant to be pedagogical, with detailed\nmathematics presented beyond the level one can find any easily in the\ntextbooks. The discussions, however, bring up important subtleties and\nambiguities about the subject that may be less than well appreciated. In fact,\nthe naive perspective of the nature and masses of fermions as one would easily\ndrawn from the presentations of fermion fields and their equations of motion\nfrom a typical textbook on quantum field theory leads to some confusing or even\nwrong statements which we clarify here. In particular, we illustrate clearly\nthat a Dirac fermion mass eigenstate is mathematically equivalent to two\ndegenerated Majorana fermion mass eigenstates at least so long as the mass\nterms are concerned. There are further ambiguities and subtleties in the exact\ndescription of the eigenstate(s).

Kinematic regions with large momentum\ntransfer are identified, where the corrections become large and may lead to\nstrong distortions of differential distributions, thus mimicking anomalous top\nquark couplings. As a complementary case we investigate the threshold region,\ncorresponding to configurations with small relative velocity between top and\nantitop quark, which is particularly sensitive to the top-quark Yukawa\ncoupling.

In this procedure the Hamiltonian is first cast in a positive\nsemidefinite form using composite operators as a linear combination of creation\noperators acting on the sites of finite blocks. In the same step, the\ninteraction is also transformed to obtain terms which require for their minimum\neigenvalue zero at least one electron on each site. The transformed Hamiltonian\nmatches the original Hamiltonian through a nonlinear system of equations whose\nsolutions place the deduced ground states in restricted regions of the\nparameter space. In the second step, nonlocal product wave functions in\nposition space are constructed. They are proven to be unique ground states\nwhich describe non-saturated ferromagnetic and correlated half metallic states.\nThese solutions emerge when the strength of the Hubbard interaction $U_i$ is\nsite dependent inside the unit cell. In the deduced phases, the interactions\ntune the bare dispersive band structure such to develop an effective upper flat\nband. We show that this band flattening effect emerges for a broader class of\nchains and is not restricted to pentagon chains. For the characterization of\nthe deduced solutions, uniqueness proofs, exact ground state expectation values\nfor long-range hopping amplitudes and correlation functions are also\ncalculated. The study of physical reasons which lead to the appearance of\nferromagnetism has revealed a new mechanism for the emergence of an ordered\nphase, described here in details (because of lack of space see the continuation\nin the paper).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 May 2013 15:49:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-27"}
