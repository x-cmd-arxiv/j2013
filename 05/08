The collisional thick target model (CTTM) predicts that sources\nproduced by harder power-law injection spectra should appear further down the\nlegs or footpoints of a flare loop. Therefore, hardening of the injected\npower-law electron spectrum during flare onset should be concurrent with a\ndescending hard X-ray source.\n  Aims: To test this implication of the CTTM by comparing its predicted HXR\nsource locations with those derived from observations of a solar flare which\nexhibits a nonthermally-dominated spectrum before the peak in HXRs, known as an\nearly impulsive event.\n  Methods: HXR images and spectra of an early impulsive C-class flare were\nobtained using the Ramaty High-Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI).\nImages were reconstructed to produce HXR source height evolutions for three\nenergy bands. Spatially-integrated spectral analysis was performed to isolate\nnonthermal emission, and to determine the power-law index of the electron\ninjection spectrum. The observed height-time evolutions were then fit with\nCTTM-based simulated heights for each energy.\n  Results: A good match between model and observed source heights was reached,\nrequiring a density model that agreed well with previous studies of flare loop\ndensities.\n  Conclusions: The CTTM has been used to produce a descent of model HXR source\nheights that compares well with observations of this event. Based on this\ninterpretation, downward motion of nonthermal sources should indeed occur in\nany flare where there is spectral hardening in the electron distribution during\na flare. However, this would often be masked by thermal emission associated\nwith flare plasma pre-heating.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 May 2013 16:28:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

The absence of any net\nenhancement beyond 150 kpc provides reassurance that the detected enhancements\nare due to galaxy-galaxy interactions, rather than larger scale environmental\neffects or potential pair selection biases.

For small masses, with a suitable choice\nof the renormalization scheme we obtain stable numerical results even in the\nmassless limit. We analyze the N - point functions in this background and show\nthat, even in the absence of the radial suppression factor, the two-point\ncontribution to the effective action is the only obstacle to taking its\nmassless limit. The standard O(2)xO(3) background leads to a chiral anomaly\nterm in the effective action, and both our perturbative and nonperturbative\nresults strongly suggest that the small-mass asymptotic behavior of the\neffective action is, after the subtraction of the two-point contribution,\ndominated by this anomaly term as the only source of a logarithmic mass\ndependence. This confirms a conjecture by M. Fry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 May 2013 18:37:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

Thus, our new results place even\ntighter constraints on the loss of specific angular momentum by galactic disks\nover their lifetimes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 May 2013 20:00:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

To investigate the\nformation and properties of nuclear stellar discs (NSDs), we look for their\npresence in a set of N-body simulations studying the dissipationless merging of\nmultiple star clusters in galactic nuclei. A few tens of star clusters with\nsizes and masses comparable to those of globular clusters observed in the Milky\nWay are accreted onto a pre-existing nuclear stellar component: either a\nmassive super star cluster or a rapidly rotating, compact disc with a\nscale-length of a few parsecs, mimicing the variety of observed nuclear\nstructures. Images and kinematic maps of the simulation time-steps are then\nbuilt and analysed as if they were real and at the distance of the Virgo\ncluster. We use the Scorza-Bender method to search for the presence of disc\nstructures via photometric decomposition. In one case the merger remnant has\nall the observed photometric and kinematic properties of NSDs observed in real\ngalaxies. This shows that current observations are consistent with most of the\nNSD mass being assembled from the migration and accretion of star clusters into\nthe galactic centre. In the other simulation instead, we detect an elongated\nstructure from the unsharp masked image, that does not develop the photometric\nor kinematic signature of a NSD. Thus, in the context of searches for a disc\nstructure, the Scorza-Bender method is a robust and necessary tool.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 May 2013 20:00:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

A 545GHz flux density limit was chosen so that\nthe sample is 80% complete at this frequency, giving a sample of 234 local\ngalaxies. We investigate the dust emission and star formation properties of the\nsample via various models & calculate the local dust mass function. Although\n1-component modified black bodies fit the dust emission longward of 80um very\nwell (median beta=1.83) the degeneracy between dust temp & beta also means that\nthe SEDs are very well described by a dust emissivity index fixed at beta=2 and\n10<T<25 K. Although a second, warmer dust component is required to fit shorter\nwavelength data, & contributes ~1/3 of the total infrared emission, its mass is\nnegligible. No evidence is found for a very cold (6-10 K) dust component. The\ntemp of the cold dust component is strongly influenced by the ratio of the star\nformation rate to the total dust mass. This implies, contrary to what is often\nassumed, that a significant fraction of even the emission from ~20 K dust is\npowered by ongoing star formation, whether or not the dust itself is associated\nwith star forming clouds or `cirrus'. There is statistical evidence of a\nfree-free contribution to the 217GHz flux densities of <20%. We find a median\ndust-to-stellar mass ratio of 0.0046; & that this ratio is anti-correlated with\ngalaxy mass. There is good correlation between dust mass & atomic gas mass\n(median M_d/M_HI = 0.022), suggesting that galaxies that have more dust have\nmore interstellar medium in general. Our derived dust mass function implies a\nmean dust mass density of the local Universe (for dust within galaxies), of\n7.0+-1.4 x 10^5 M_solar/Mpc, significantly greater than that found in the most\nrecent estimate using Herschel data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 May 2013 21:16:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

The salient and interesting features that the complex network study\noffer in comparison to graph theory are the emphasis on the dynamical\nproperties of the networks and the ability of inherently uncovering pattern\nformation of the vertices. In this paper, we present a hybrid data\nclassification technique combining a low level and a high level classifier. The\nlow level term can be equipped with any traditional classification techniques,\nwhich realize the classification task considering only physical features (e.g.,\ngeometrical or statistical features) of the input data. On the other hand, the\nhigh level term has the ability of detecting data patterns with semantic\nmeanings. In this way, the classification is realized by means of the\nextraction of the underlying network's features constructed from the input\ndata. As a result, the high level classification process measures the\ncompliance of the test instances with the pattern formation of the training\ndata. Out of various high level perspectives that can be utilized to capture\nsemantic meaning, we utilize the dynamical features that are generated from a\ntourist walker in a networked environment.

Additionally, we show\nsignificant correlations between the radiation emitted in the flare rise and\ndecay phases.

In the online\nvertex cover problem, we are required to maintain a monotone vertex cover in a\ngraph whose vertices arrive online. When a vertex arrives, all its incident\nedges to previously arrived vertices are revealed to the algorithm. For\nbipartite graphs with the left vertices offline (i.e. all of the left vertices\narrive first before any right vertex), there are algorithms achieving the\noptimal competitive ratio of $\\frac{1}{1-1/e}\\approx 1.582$.\n  Our first result is a new optimal water-filling algorithm for this case. One\nmajor ingredient of our result is a new charging-based analysis, which can be\ngeneralized to attack the online fractional vertex cover problem in general\ngraphs. The main contribution of this paper is a 1.901-competitive algorithm\nfor this problem. When the underlying graph is bipartite, our fractional\nsolution can be rounded to an integral solution. In other words, we can obtain\na vertex cover with expected size at most 1.901 of the optimal vertex cover in\nbipartite graphs.\n  The next major result is a primal-dual analysis of our algorithm for the\nonline fractional vertex cover problem in general graphs, which implies the\ndual result of a 0.526-competitive algorithm for online fractional matching in\ngeneral graphs.

The platform of a co-planar interferometer can be deformed due\nto driving forces and gravity. A deformed platform will induce extra components\ninto the geometric delay of each baseline, and change the phases of observed\nvisibilities. The reconstructed images will also be diluted due to the errors\nof the phases. The platform deformations of The Yuan-Tseh Lee Array for\nMicrowave Background Anisotropy (AMiBA) were modelled based on photogrammetry\ndata with about 20 mount pointing positions. We then used the differential\noptical pointing error between two optical telescopes to fit the model\nparameters in the entire horizontal coordinate space. With the platform\ndeformation model, we can predict the errors of the geometric phase delays due\nto platform deformation with given azimuth and elevation of the targets and\ncalibrators. After correcting the phases of the radio point sources in the\nAMiBA interferometric data, we recover 50% - 70% flux loss due to phase errors.\nThis allows us to restore more than 90% of a source flux.

Here we consider subdiffusive\ncontinuous time random walks, that represent a seminal model for the anomalous\ndiffusion of tracer particles in complex environments. This motion is\ncharacterized by multiple trapping events with infinite mean sojourn time. In\nreal physical situations, however, instead of the full immobilization predicted\nby the continuous time random walk model, the motion of the tracer particle\nshows additional jiggling, for instance, due to thermal agitation of the\nenvironment. We here present and analyze in detail an extension of the\ncontinuous time random walk model. Superimposing the multiple trapping behavior\nwith additive Gaussian noise of variable strength, we demonstrate that the\nresulting process exhibits a rich variety of apparent dynamic regimes. In\nparticular, such noisy continuous time random walks may appear ergodic while\nthe naked continuous time random walk exhibits weak ergodicity breaking.\nDetailed knowledge of this behavior will be useful for the truthful physical\nanalysis of experimentally observed subdiffusion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 May 2013 06:02:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

However, this supernova ejecta lack\nmomentum and falls back onto the neutron star which gets transformed to a\nstellar mass black hole. In order to study the hydrodynamics and\nnucleosynthesis of such an accretion disk formed from the fallback material of\nthe supernova ejecta, we use the well established hydrodynamic models. In such\na disk neutrino cooling becomes important in the inner disk where the\ntemperature and density are higher.

In this paper we\ninitially performed experiments to examine the theory regarding rotation and\nvibration of an AC LFM. While many theoretical predictions are in agreement\nwith our experimental data, but in the threshold of vibration there is an\nobvious disagreement; we showed that no threshold exists and oscillation is\nobserved in any field value. Experimental evidence showed the existence of an\nelastic deformation in water before reaching the yield stress and lead us to\nthe use of the elastic Bingham fluid model. We revised the theories using this\nmodel and investigated the behaviour of a vibrating LFM which has more\napplications in mixing. We applied a numerical solution to derive different\nphases of vibration and distinguish between elastic and plastic vibrations, the\nlatter which could be used for mixing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 May 2013 11:13:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-09"}

However, no GRB was detected in\nassociation with the SN. Here, the properties of SN2010ah are determined with\nhigher accuracy than previous studies through modelling. New Subaru telescope\nphotometry is presented. A bolometric light curve is constructed taking\nadvantage of the spectral similarity with SN1998bw. Radiation transport tools\nare used to reproduce the spectra and the light curve. The results thus\nobtained regarding ejecta mass, composition and kinetic energy are then used to\ncompute a synthetic light curve. This is in reasonable agreement with the early\nbolometric light curve of SN2010ah, but a high abundance of 56Ni at high\nvelocity is required to reproduce the early rise, while a dense inner core must\nbe used to reproduce the slow decline at late phases. The high-velocity 56Ni\ncannot have been located on our line of sight, which may be indirect evidence\nfor an off-axis, aspherical explosion. The main properties of SN2010ah are:\nejected mass ~ 3 Mo; kinetic energy ~10^52 erg, M(56Ni) ~ 0.25 Mo. The mass\nlocated at v >~ 0.1c is ~0.2 Mo. Although these values, in particular the\nkinetic energy, are quite large for a SN Ic, they are all smaller (especially\nthe ejecta mass) than those typical of GRB/SNe. This confirms the tendency for\nthese quantities to correlate, and suggests that there are minimum requirements\nfor a GRB/SN, which SN2010ah may not meet although it comes quite close.\nDepending on whether a neutron star or a black hole was formed following core\ncollapse, SN2010ah was the explosion of a CO core of ~ 5-6 Mo, pointing to a\nprogenitor mass of ~24 - 28 Mo.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 May 2013 12:50:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

For this purpose we go beyond the\nadiabatic approximation and perform full Ehrenfest dynamics simulations. The\nnumerical scheme implements a mixed quantum-classical algorithm for open\nsystems and is capable to deal with arbitrary time-dependent driving fields. We\nfind that the Van der Pol oscillations are extremely stable. The nonadiabatic\nelectron dynamics distorts the trajectory in the momentum-coordinate phase\nspace but preserves the limit cycles in an average sense. We further show that\nhigh-frequency fields change both the oscillation amplitudes and the average\nnuclear positions. By switching the fields off at different times one obtains\ncycles of different amplitudes which attain the limit cycle only after\nconsiderably long times.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 May 2013 13:20:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

Examples in single particle deterministic systems are less\ncommon. Recently, in one such example, uphill motion was shown to occur for an\ninertial driven and damped particle in a spatially symmetric periodic\npotential.

This suggests that increasing non-thermal excitation due to decreasing\noptical depth for the gamma-rays is driving the early evolution of these lines.\nWe also provide and discuss pre- and post-explosion observations of the SN site\nwhich shows a reduction by 75 percent in flux at the position of the yellow\nsupergiant coincident with SN 2011dh. The B, V and r band decline rates of\n0.0073, 0.0090 and 0.0053 mag/day respectively are consistent with the\nremaining flux being emitted by the SN. Hence we find that the star was indeed\nthe progenitor of SN 2011dh as previously suggested by Maund et al. (2011) and\nwhich is also consistent with the results from the hydrodynamical modelling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 May 2013 15:26:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Nov 2013 19:37:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

Infrequent k-mers are\nassumed to be a result of sequencing errors. The frequent k-mers constitute a\nreduced but error-free representation of the experiment, which can inform read\nerror correction or serve as the input to de novo assembly methods. Ideally,\nthe memory requirement for counting should be linear in the number of frequent\nk-mers and not in the, typically much larger, total number of k-mers in the\nread library.\n  We present a novel method that balances time, space and accuracy requirements\nto efficiently extract frequent k-mers even for high coverage libraries and\nlarge genomes such as human. Our method is designed to minimize cache-misses in\na cache-efficient manner by using a Pattern-blocked Bloom filter to remove\ninfrequent k-mers from consideration in combination with a novel\nsort-and-compact scheme, instead of a Hash, for the actual counting. While this\nincreases theoretical complexity, the savings in cache misses reduce the\nempirical running times. A variant can resort to a counting Bloom filter for\neven larger savings in memory at the expense of false negatives in addition to\nthe false positives common to all Bloom filter based approaches. A comparison\nto the state-of-the-art shows reduced memory requirements and running times.\nNote that we also provide the first competitive method to count k-mers up to\nsize 64.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 May 2013 15:49:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-09"}

Of particular interest to this study are heat and moisture transport in\nunsaturated soils. Historically, mathematical models for these processes are\nderived by coupling classical Darcy's, Fourier's, and Fick's laws with volume\naveraged conservation of mass and energy and empirically based source and sink\nterms. Recent experimental and mathematical research has proposed modifications\nand suggested limitations in these classical equations. The primary goal of\nthis thesis is to derive a thermodynamically consistent system of equations for\nheat and moisture transport in terms of the chemical potential that addresses\nsome of these limitations.

The resulting coupled\nsystem of nonlinear partial differential equations is solved numerically and\nvalidated against the classical equations and against experimental data. It\nwill be shown that under a mixture theoretic framework, the classical Richards'\nequation for saturation is supplemented with gradients in temperature, relative\nhumidity, and the time rate of change of saturation. Furthermore, it will be\nshown that restating the water vapor diffusion equation in terms of chemical\npotential eliminates the necessity for an empirically based fitting parameter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 May 2013 18:41:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-13"}
