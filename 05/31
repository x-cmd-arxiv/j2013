Such a strength is insufficient to act as seed for the galactic\ndynamo effect, which requires a magnetic field larger than $10^{-20} G$. In\nthis paper we analyze simple extensions of the minimal model, which avoid both\nthe strong coupling and back reaction problems, in order to generate\nsufficiently large magnetic fields on the Mpc scale today. First we study the\npossibility that the coupling function which breaks the conformal invariance of\nelectromagnetism is non-monotonic with sharp features.

In the latter case, a systematic\nstudy shows upper bounds for the magnetic field strength today on the Mpc scale\nof $10^{-13} G$ for low scale inflation and $10^{-25} G$ for high scale\ninflation, thus improving on the previous result by 7-19 orders of magnitude.\nThese results are consistent with the strong coupling and back reaction\nconstraints.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 May 2013 16:09:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 16 Aug 2013 19:47:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 29 Oct 2013 09:55:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-30"}

In this paper, we\nconsider several implementations of two semi-analytical models. Focusing on\nimplementations in which bulges are formed during mergers only, we examine the\nfractions of elliptical galaxies and both passive and star-forming disk\ngalaxies as functions of stellar and halo mass, for central and satellite\nsystems. This is compared to an observational cross-matched SDSS+RC3 z ~ 0\nsample of galaxies with accurate visual morphological classifications and\nM_{stellar} > 10^10.5 M_{sol}. The models qualitatively reproduce the observed\nincrease of elliptical fraction with stellar mass, and with halo mass for\ncentral galaxies, supporting the idea that observed ellipticals form during\nmajor mergers. However, the overall elliptical fraction produced by the models\nis much too high compared with the z ~ 0 data. Since the \"passive\" -- i.e.\nnon-star-forming -- fractions are approximately reproduced, and since the\nfraction which are star-forming disc galaxies is also reproduced, the problem\nis that the models overproduce ellipticals at the expense of passive S0 and\nspiral galaxies. Bulge-growth implementations (tuned to reproduce simulations)\nwhich allow the survival of residual discs in major mergers still destroy too\nmuch of the disc. Increasing the lifetime of satellites, or allowing\nsignificant disc regrowth around merger remnants, merely increases the fraction\nof star-forming disc galaxies. Instead, it seems necessary to reduce the mass\nratios of merging galaxies, so that most mergers produce modest bulge growth in\ndisc-galaxy remnants instead of ellipticals.

In our experiments suspended liquid film (water + soap film) is\nformed on the surface of a circular frame, which is forced to rotate in the\n$x-y$ horizontal plane by a motor. This system is located at the center of two\ncapacitor-like vertical plates to apply an external electric voltage difference\nin the $x-$direction. The produced electric current is collected from the\nliquid film using two conducting electrodes that are separated in the\n$y-$direction. We previously reported that a liquid film in an external\nelectric field rotates when an electric current passes through it, naming it\nthe liquid film motor (LFM). In this paper we report a novel technique, in\nwhich a similar device can be used as an electric generator, converting the\nrotating mechanical energy to electrical energy. The liquid film electric\ngenerator (LFEG) is in stark contrast to the LFM, both of which could be\ndesigned similarly in very small scales like micro scales with different\napplications.

The formalism of dimension (or Hochschild homology) of a dualizable\nobject in the context of higher algebra provides a unifying framework for\nclassical notions such as Euler characteristics, Chern characters, and\ncharacters of group representations. Moreover, the simple functoriality\nproperties of dimensions clarify celebrated identities and extend them to new\ncontexts.\n  We observe that it is advantageous to calculate dimensions, traces and their\nfunctoriality directly in the nonlinear geometric setting of correspondence\ncategories, where they are directly identified with (derived versions of) loop\nspaces, fixed point loci and loop maps, respectively. This results in universal\nnonlinear versions of Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch theorems, Atiyah-Bott-Lefschetz\ntrace formulas, and Frobenius-Weyl character formulas. On the one hand, we can\nthen linearize by applying sheaf theories, such as the theories of coherent\nsheaves and D-modules, developed by Gaitsgory and Rozenblyum, as functors out\nof correspondence categories (in the spirit of topological field theory). This\nrecovers the familiar classical identities, in families and without any\nsmoothness or transversality assumptions.

This effect, known as clonal interference, causes\nerratic fluctuations in the frequencies of observed mutations, randomizes the\nfixation times of successful mutations, and leaves distinct signatures on\npatterns of genetic variation. Here, we show how this form of `genetic draft'\naffects the forward-time dynamics of site frequencies in rapidly adapting\nasexual populations. We calculate the probability that mutations at individual\nsites shift in frequency over a characteristic timescale, extending Gillespie's\noriginal model of draft to the case where many strongly selected beneficial\nmutations segregate simultaneously. We then derive the sojourn time of mutant\nalleles, the expected fixation time of successful mutants, and the site\nfrequency spectrum of beneficial and neutral mutations. We show how this form\nof draft affects inferences in the McDonald-Kreitman test, and how it relates\nto recent observations that some aspects of genetic diversity are described by\nthe Bolthausen-Sznitman coalescent in the limit of very rapid adaptation.\nFinally, we describe how our method can be extended to model evolution on\nfitness landscapes that include some forms of epistasis, such as landscapes\nthat are partitioned into two or more incompatible evolutionary trajectories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 May 2013 18:32:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-31"}

We\nderive improved empirical relations for gravitational wave asteroseismology\nwith f-modes and for the first time we consider not only quadrupolar\noscillations but also modes with higher spherical order (l=|m|=3,4). After\nperforming a systematic comparison with polytropic EoS, it is shown that the\nempirical relations found in this case approximately also hold for realistic\nEoS. Even more, we show that these relations will not change significantly even\nif the Cowling approximation is dropped and the full general relativistic case\nis considered, although the normalization used here(frequencies and damping\ntimes in the nonrotating limit) could differ considerably. We also address the\ninverse problem, i.e. we investigate in detail what kind of observational data\nis required in order to determine characteristical neutron star parameters. It\nis shown that masses, radii and rotation rates can be estimated quite\naccurately using the derived asteroseismology relations. We also compute the\ninstability window for certain models, i.e. the limiting curve in a\nT-\\Omega-plane where the secular Chandrasekhar-Friedman-Schutz(CFS) instability\novercomes dissipative effects, and show that some of the modern realistic EoS\nwill lead to a larger instability window compared to all of the polytropic ones\npresented so far in the literature. Additionally, we calculate the r-mode\ninstability window and compare it with the f-mode-case. The overall results for\nthe instability window suggest that it is vital to take into account\noscillations with l=3,4 when considering gravitational wave asteroseismology\nusing the f-mode in rapidly rotating neutron stars, as these modes can become\nCFS unstable for a much larger range of parameters than pure quadrupolar\noscillations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 May 2013 18:35:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-04"}

An example is superfluid $^3$He-B, where the\nbroken symmetry leads to 4 Goldstone modes and at least 14 Higgs modes, which\nare characterized by angular momentum quantum number $J$ and parity. Based on\nthe relation $E_{J+}^2+E_{J-}^2=4\\Delta^2$ for the energy spectrum of these\nmodes, Yoichiro Nambu proposed the general sum rule, which relates masses of\nHiggs bosons and masses of fermions. If this rule is applicable to Standard\nModel, one may expect that the observed Higgs boson with mass $M_{{\\rm\nH}1}=125$ GeV has a Nambu partner -- the second Higgs boson with mass $M_{{\\rm\nH}2}=325$ GeV.

This gives the mass around 210\nGeV for the Nambu partner of the 125 GeV Higgs boson.

We use combined electronic\ntransport/Kelvin Probe Microscopy measurements to quantify the amount of charge\ntransferred to RGO due to chemical doping when the device is exposed to\nelectron-acceptor (acetone) and electron-donor (ammonia) analytes. We\ndemonstrate that this method allows us to obtain high-resolution maps of the\nsurface potential and local charge distribution both before and after chemical\ndoping, to identify local gate-susceptible areas on the RGO surface, and to\ndirectly extract the contact resistance between the RGO and the metallic\nelectrodes. The method presented is general, suggesting that these results have\nimportant implications for building graphene and other nanomaterial-based\nchemical sensors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 May 2013 19:53:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

We use the largest catalogue of 887\n[O III]{\\lambda}5007-selected type 2 quasars (QSO2s) at z<0.83 in the\nliterature from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, and the 258 hard (>4.5 keV)\nX-ray-selected AGN from the Bright Ultrahard XMM-Newton Survey (BUXS). The\nfraction of SDSS QSO2s in our infrared AGN selection region (wedge) increases\nwith the AGN luminosity, reaching 66.1+4.5_4.7% at the highest [O III]\nluminosities in the sample. This fraction is substantially lower than for the\nBUXS type 1 AGN (96.1+3.0_6.3%), but consistent, within the uncertainties, with\nthat for the BUXS type 2 AGN (75.0+14.1_19.1%) with the same luminosity. The\nSDSS QSO2s appear to reside in more luminous (massive) hosts than the BUXS AGN,\ndue to the tight magnitude limits applied in the SDSS spectroscopic target\nselection. Since host galaxy dilution can reduce substantially the\neffectiveness of MIR-based techniques, this may explain the lower fraction of\nSDSS QSO2s in the WISE AGN wedge.

At the AGN luminosities involved in the\ncomparison, Compton-thick and Compton-thin SDSS QSO2s have similar WISE colour\ndistributions.

While\ncareful modeling can reduce artifacts caused by convergence, the most\nconsistent and robust phylogenetic signal in genomes may lie distributed among\nencoded functional features that govern macromolecular interactions.

Using a simple\ntRNA-CIF-based phyloclassifier, we obtained results consistent with those of\nbias-corrected whole proteome phylogenomic studies, rejecting monophyly of\nSAR11 and affiliating most strains with Rhizobiales with strong statistical\nsupport.

However, by accurately measuring the environment in real time, the\nquantum system can be maintained in a pure state and its time evolution\ndescribed by a quantum trajectory conditioned on the measurement outcome. We\nemploy weak measurements to monitor a microwave cavity embedding a\nsuperconducting qubit and track the individual quantum trajectories of the\nsystem. In this architecture, the environment is dominated by the fluctuations\nof a single electromagnetic mode of the cavity.

In\ncontrast to most previous works in the literature, which analyzed the\nbackground dynamics of f(R) gravity by means of a dynamical system, we proceed\nby focusing on the equivalent scalar field description of the theory, which we\nbelieve is a more intuitive way of treating the problem. In order to study how\nthe physical solutions evolve in f(R) cosmology, we explore the cosmological\ndynamics of a range of f(R) models, including models that yield a large\nhierarchy of scales and are singularity free. We present generic features of\nthe phase-space dynamics in f(R) cosmology. We study the global structure of\nthe phase space in f(R) gravity by compactifying the infinite phase space into\na finite space via the Poincare transformation. On the expansion branch of the\nphase space, the constraint surface has a repeller and a de Sitter attractor;\nwhile on the contraction branch, the constraint surface has an attractor and a\nde Sitter repeller.

One of major challenges for a detector such as the proposed\nInternational Large Detector (ILD) is to provide excellent momentum resolution\nin a magnetic filed with small (but non-negligible) non-uniformity. The\nnon-uniform magnetic field implies deviation from a helical track and hence\nrequires the extension of a helical track model used for track fitting in a\nuniform magnetic field. In this paper, a segment-wise helical track model is\nintroduced as such an extension. The segment-wise helical track model\napproximates the magnetic field between two nearby measurement sites to be\nuniform and steps between the two sites along a helix. The helix frame is then\ntransformed according to the new magnetic field direction for the next step, so\nas to take into account the non-uniformity of the magnetic field.

The problem of hyperspectral unmixing has proven to be a\ndifficult task in unsupervised work settings where the endmembers and\nabundances are both unknown. What is more, this task becomes more challenging\nin the case that the spectral bands are degraded with noise. This paper\npresents a robust model for unsupervised hyperspectral unmixing. Specifically,\nour model is developed with the correntropy based metric where the non-negative\nconstraints on both endmembers and abundances are imposed to keep physical\nsignificance. In addition, a sparsity prior is explicitly formulated to\nconstrain the distribution of the abundances of each endmember. To solve our\nmodel, a half-quadratic optimization technique is developed to convert the\noriginal complex optimization problem into an iteratively re-weighted NMF with\nsparsity constraints. As a result, the optimization of our model can adaptively\nassign small weights to noisy bands and give more emphasis on noise-free bands.\nIn addition, with sparsity constraints, our model can naturally generate sparse\nabundances. Experiments on synthetic and real data demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our model in comparison to the related state-of-the-art\nunmixing models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 May 2013 06:43:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-03"}

Levins-like models, in which local patches are\ntreated as either occupied or empty, have been used extensively for this\npurpose, but they ignore the important role of local population dynamics. In\nthis paper, we consider a stochastic metapopulation model where local\npopulations follow a Ricker dynamics, and use this framework to investigate the\nbehaviour of the metapopulation at the brink of extinction.

This spin-orbit misalignment is unexpected,\nas planets form in a protoplanetary disc supposedly aligned with the stellar\nspin. Planet-planet interactions are supposed to lead to a mutual inclination,\nbut the effects of the protoplanetary disc are still unknown. We investigate\ntherefore planet-disc interactions for planets above 1M_Jup. We check the\ninfluence of the inclination i, eccentricity e, and mass M_p of the planet. We\nperform 3D numerical simulations of protoplanetary discs with embedded\nhigh-mass planets. We provide damping formulae for i and e as a function of i,\ne, and M_p that fit the numerical data. For highly inclined massive planets,\nthe gap opening is reduced, and the damping of i occurs on time-scales of the\norder of 10^-4 deg/yr M_disc/(0.01 M_star) with the damping of e on a smaller\ntime-scale. While the inclination of low planetary masses (<5M_Jup) is always\ndamped, large planetary masses with large i can undergo a Kozai-cycle with the\ndisc. These Kozai-cycles are damped in time. Eccentricity is generally damped,\nexcept for very massive planets (M_p = 5M_Jup) where eccentricity can increase\nfor low inclinations. The dynamics tends to a final state: planets end up in\nmidplane and can then, over time, increase their eccentricity as a result of\ninteractions with the disc. The interactions with the disc lead to damping of i\nand e after a scattering event of high-mass planets. If i is sufficiently\nreduced, the eccentricity can be pumped up because of interactions with the\ndisc. If the planet is scattered to high inclination, it can undergo a\nKozai-cycle with the disc that makes it hard to predict the exact movement of\nthe planet and its orbital parameters at the dispersal of the disc.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 May 2013 09:12:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-09"}

In multiparametric\ncytometry, which is often used for analyzing patient samples, such issues are\ncritical. While computational methods can identify cell populations in\nindividual samples, without the ability to automatically match them across\nsamples, it is difficult to compare and characterize the populations in typical\nexperiments, such as those responding to various stimulations or distinctive of\nparticular patients or time-points, especially when there are many samples.\nJoint Clustering and Matching (JCM) is a multi-level framework for simultaneous\nmodeling and registration of populations across a cohort. JCM models every\npopulation with a robust multivariate probability distribution. Simultaneously,\nJCM fits a random-effects model to construct an overall batch template -- used\nfor registering populations across samples, and classifying new samples. By\ntackling systems-level variation, JCM supports practical biomedical\napplications involving large cohorts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 May 2013 09:53:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

The system is then assumed to be in the ferromagnetic\nstate.\n  The ferromagnetic equation of state is employed to study matter in the\nneutron star interior. We find that as the density increases the ferromagnetic\nfield does not increase continuously, but exhibit sudden rapid increases. These\nsudden increases in the magnetic field correspond to shifts between different\nconfigurations of the charged particle's Landau levels and can have significant\nobservational consequences for neutron stars. We also found that although the\nferromagnetic phase softens the neutron star equation of state it does not\nsignificantly alter the star's mass-radius relationship.\n  The properties of magnetised symmetric nuclear matter were also studied. We\nconfirm that magnetised matter tends to be more proton-rich but become more\nweakly bound for stronger magnetic fields.

Our framework is\nadapted to the well-established industry-standard brep format to enable its\nimplementation in modern CAD systems. This is achieved via a \"local analysis\",\nwhich covers parametrization and singularities, as well as a \"global theory\"\nwhich tackles face-boundaries, self-intersections and trim curves. Central to\nthe local analysis is the \"funnel\" which serves as a natural parameter space\nfor the basic surfaces constituting the sweep. The trimming problem is reduced\nto the problem of surface-surface intersections of these basic surfaces. Based\non the complexity of these intersections, we introduce a novel classification\nof sweeps as either decomposable or non-decomposable. Further, we construct an\n{\\em invariant} function $\\theta$ on the funnel which efficiently separates\ndecomposable and non-decomposable sweeps. Through a geometric theorem we also\nshow intimate connections between $\\theta$, local curvatures and the inverse\ntrajectory used in earlier works as an approach towards trimming. In contrast\nto the inverse trajectory approach, $\\theta$ is robust and is the key to a\ncomplete structural understanding, and an efficient computation of both, the\nsingular locus and the trim curves, which are central to a stable\nimplementation.

Gas-gas collisions can occur in the form of\nICM ram pressure stripping, galaxy head-on collisions, compression of the\nintragroup gas and/or galaxy ISM by an intruder galaxy which flies through the\ngalaxy group at a high velocity, or external gas accretion on an existing gas\ntorus in a galactic center. We suggest that the common theme of all these\ngas-gas interactions is adiabatic compression of the ISM leading to an increase\nof the turbulent velocity dispersion of the gas. The turbulent gas clouds are\nthen overpressured and star formation is quenched. Within this scenario we\ndeveloped a model for turbulent clumpy gas disks where the energy to drive\nturbulence is supplied by external infall or the gain of potential energy by\nradial gas accretion within the disk. The cloud size is determined by the size\nof a C-type shock propagating in dense molecular clouds with a low ionization\nfraction at a given velocity dispersion. We give expressions for the expected\nvolume and area filling factors, mass, density, column density, and velocity\ndispersion of the clouds. The latter is based on scaling relations of\nintermittent turbulence whose open parameters are estimated for the CND in the\nGalactic Center. The properties of the model gas clouds and the external mass\naccretion rate necessary for the quenching of the star formation rate due to\nadiabatic compression are consistent with those derived from high-resolution\nH_2 line observations. Based on these findings, a scenario for the evolution of\ngas tori in galactic centers is proposed and the implications for star\nformation in the Galactic Center are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 May 2013 10:58:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

The existence of DM in DANSs results in a\nspread of mass-radius relationships that cannot be interpreted with a unique\nequilibrium sequence.

Recent post-tsunami survey data,\nsupported by numerical simulations, reveal that the run-up on coastal areas\nbehind small islands was significantly higher than on neighboring locations not\naffected by the presence of the island. To study the conditions of this run- up\namplification, we solve numerically the nonlinear shallow water equations\n(NSWE). We use the simplified geometry of a conical island sitting on a flat\nbed in front of a uniform sloping beach. By doing so, the experimental setup is\ndefined by five physical parameters, namely the island slope, the beach slope,\nthe water depth, the distance between the island and the plane beach and the\nincoming wavelength, while the wave height was kept fixed. The objective is\ntwofold: Find the maximum run-up amplification with the least number of\nsimulations. To achieve this goal, we build an emulator based on Gaussian\nProcesses to guide the selection of the query points in the parameter space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 May 2013 13:08:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

We find dogs and wolves diverged through a dynamic process\ninvolving population bottlenecks in both lineages and post-divergence gene\nflow, which confounds previous inferences of dog origins. In dogs, the\ndomestication bottleneck was severe involving a 17 to 49-fold reduction in\npopulation size, a much stronger bottleneck than estimated previously from less\nintensive sequencing efforts. A sharp bottleneck in wolves occurred soon after\ntheir divergence from dogs, implying that the pool of diversity from which dogs\narose was far larger than represented by modern wolf populations. Conditional\non mutation rate, we narrow the plausible range for the date of initial dog\ndomestication to an interval from 11 to 16 thousand years ago. This period\npredates the rise of agriculture, implying that the earliest dogs arose\nalongside hunter-gathers rather than agriculturists. Regarding the geographic\norigin of dogs, we find that surprisingly, none of the extant wolf lineages\nfrom putative domestication centers are more closely related to dogs, and the\nsampled wolves instead form a sister monophyletic clade. This result, in\ncombination with our finding of dog-wolf admixture during the process of\ndomestication, suggests a re-evaluation of past hypotheses of dog origin is\nnecessary. Finally, we also detect signatures of selection, including evidence\nfor selection on genes implicated in morphology, metabolism, and neural\ndevelopment.

Even for\nthe simplest pion, one can't discriminate from different DA models. Inversely,\none expects that processes involving pion can in principle provide strong\nconstraints on the pion DA. For example, the pion-photon transition form factor\n(TFF) can get accurate information of the pion wave function or DA, due to the\nsingle pion in this process. However, the data from Belle and BABAR have a big\ndifference on TFF in high $Q^2$ regions, at present, they are helpless for\ndetermining the pion DA. At the present paper, we think it is still possible to\ndetermine the pion DA as long as we perform a combined analysis of the most\nexisting data of the processes involving pion such as $\\pi \\to \\mu \\bar{\\nu}$,\n$\\pi^0 \\to \\gamma \\gamma$, $B\\to \\pi l \\nu$, $D \\to \\pi l \\nu$, and etc. Based\non the revised light-cone harmonic oscillator model, a convenient DA model has\nbeen suggested, whose parameter $B$ which dominates its longitudinal behavior\nfor $\\phi_{\\pi}(x,\\mu^2)$ can be determined in a definite range by those\nprocesses. A light-cone sum rule analysis of the semi-leptonic processes $B \\to\n\\pi l \\nu$ and $D \\to \\pi l \\nu$ leads to a narrow region $B = [0.01,0.14]$,\nwhich indicate a slight deviation from the asymptotic DA. Then, one can predict\nthe behavior of the pion-photon TFF in high $Q^2$ regions which can be tested\nin the future experiments.

In order to cope with this fact, we introduce\nhere the notion of the Maximally Entangled Set (MES) of n-partite states.

Only the outermost ejecta layers with free-expansion\nvelocities larger than about 18,000 km/s have been shocked so far in this\ndynamically young, likely Type Ia SNR. A long (980 ks) Chandra observation in\n2011 allowed spatially-resolved spectroscopy of heavy-element ejecta. We\ndenoised Chandra data with the spatio-spectral method of Krishnamurthy et al.,\nand used a wavelet-based technique to spatially localize thermal emission\nproduced by intermediate-mass elements (IMEs: Si and S) and iron. The spatial\ndistribution of both IMEs and Fe is extremely asymmetric, with the strongest\nejecta emission in the northern rim. Fe Kalpha emission is particularly\nprominent there, and fits with thermal models indicate strongly oversolar Fe\nabundances. In a localized, outlying region in the northern rim, IMEs are less\nabundant than Fe, indicating that undiluted Fe-group elements (including 56Ni)\nwith velocities larger than 18,000 km/s were ejected by this SN. But in the\ninner west rim, we find Si- and S-rich ejecta without any traces of Fe, so\nhigh-velocity products of O-burning were also ejected. G1.9+0.3 appears similar\nto energetic Type Ia SNe such as SN 2010jn where iron-group elements at such\nhigh free-expansion velocities have been recently detected. The pronounced\nasymmetry in the ejecta distribution and abundance inhomogeneities are best\nexplained by a strongly asymmetric SN explosion, similar to those produced in\nsome recent 3D delayed-detonation Type Ia models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 May 2013 13:46:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

While\na basic understanding of the most simple systems in question (i.e. bipartite\nsystems) has been established over the past few decades, multipartite\nentanglement still holds many unsolved questions and intriguing riddles. In\nparticular, it is completely unclear how several concepts from the bipartite\ncase can be generalised in a meaningful way to multipartite scenarios. In this\nwork, the main issues of multipartite entanglement detection, characterisation\nand classification are discussed. The differences and similarities between the\nbipartite and the multipartite situation are reviewed, various possible\ngeneralisations are presented and results are obtained in several areas. The\nfocus of this work particularly lies on a formalism - the so called HMGH\nframework, which has been developed and expanded for the past several years -\nwhich allows for construction of very specific separability criteria, capable\nof discriminating between different kinds of multipartite entanglement. By\nmeans of these criteria, the questions of partial separability, genuine\nmultipartite entanglement and - ultimately - multipartite entanglement\nclassification (which appear to contain the most striking differences to\nbipartite entanglement) are adressed and discussed. In order to illustrate the\ntheoretical conclusions in these respects, several examples are given from\ndifferent (and differently closely related) fields, showing the capabilities,\nstrengths and weaknesses of the HMGH framework as well as giving insights into\nthe current status of research in multipartite entanglement theory as a whole.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 May 2013 13:57:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-03"}

These singular gallery modes (SGMs) are excited only if the system has\na positive gain coefficient, but typically the required gain is extremely\nsmall. More importantly given any amount of gain, there are SGMs requiring\nsmaller gain than this amount. This means that, in principle, the system lacks\na lasing threshold.

In the context of pseudo-spectrum\nmethods the major challenge is related to a contamination of the B-mode\nspectrum estimate with residual power of much larger E-mode. This so-called\nE-to-B leakage is unavoidably present whenever an incomplete sky map is only\navailable, as is the case for any realistic observation. The leakage has to be\nthen minimized or removed and ideally in such a way that neither a bias nor\nextra variance is introduced. In this paper, we compare from these two\nperspectives three different methods proposed recently in this context Refs.\nSmith 2006, Zhao & Baskaran 2010, Kim & Naselsky 2010, which we first introduce\nwithin a common algebraic framework of the so-called chi-fields and then study\ntheir performance on two different experimental configurations - one\ncorresponding to a small-scale experiment covering 1% of the sky motivated by\ncurrent ground-based or balloon-borne experiments and another - to a nearly\nfull-sky experiment, e.g., a possible CMB B-mode satellite mission. We find\nthat though all these methods allow to reduce significantly the level of the\nE-to-B leakage, it is the method of Smith 2006, which at the same time ensures\nthe smallest error bars in all experimental configurations studied here, owing\nto the fact that it permits straightforwardly for an optimization of the sky\napodization of the polarization maps used for the estimation. For a\nsatellite-like experiment, this method enables a detection of B-mode power\nspectrum at large angular scales but only after appropriate binning.

Although apparently simple in its scope, the study of ionic dynamics\nin confined geometries has revealed interesting new phenomena that have an\nalmost one-to-one correspondence with the quantum regime. The picture that\nemerges is that ions can form two `quasi-particle' states, one in which they\nsurround themselves with other ions of opposite charge - ionic atmosphere - and\none in which semi-bound water molecules form layers at different distances from\nthe ions - hydration layers. The second state gives rise to two additional\neffects. In the first, which is a single quasi-particle effect, the ionic\nconductance through a nanopore is predicted to be `quantized' as a function of\npore radius, with the corresponding `quantization units' not related to\nuniversal constants - like the Plank constant and the elementary charge - but\nrather to the radii of the hydration layers. The second effect instead involves\nthe many-body interaction among ionic quasi-particles of the same sign, and\noccurs when the pore has a finite capacitance to accommodate ions so that there\nis a threshold concentration beyond which ions of the same sign are not\nenergetically allowed to enter the pore. Similar to the electron transport\ncase, the ionic counterpart appears only in the `quantum' regime, when the\nhydration layers forming the ionic quasi-particles need to break in order to\npass through the pore. Here, we review all these phenomena, and discuss the\nconditions under which they may be detected making the analogy with the\nelectronic transport case. Since nanopores are being considered for a host of\ntechnological applications in DNA sequencing and detection, we expect these\nphenomena will become very relevant and their understanding paramount to\nprogress.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 May 2013 15:19:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-13"}

The common mark of the Darboux-Poschl-Teller (DPT) potential and\nisotonic oscillator discussed in this paper is that the appropriate rational\nSturm-Liouville (RSL) equations have energy-independent characteristic\nexponents at both singular end points and as a result the appropriate sequences\nof GS Heine polynomials turn into X-OPSs with infinitely many members.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 May 2013 15:26:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-03"}

We\ncombine the results from three of these experiments with the geoelectron-spin\nmodel to obtain bounds on the velocity-dependent interactions that couple\nelectron spin to the spins of electrons, neutrons and protons. Five of the six\npossible potentials investigated were previously unbounded. The bound achieved\non V8 is about 30 orders of magnitude more restrictive in the long-range limit\nthan the only previously established constraint.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 May 2013 13:31:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

There are different axiomatizations of\nconventional probability. So, it is natural that negative probability also has\ndifferent axiomatic frameworks. In the previous publications (Burgin, 2009;\n2010), negative probability was mathematically formalized and rigorously\ninterpreted in the context of extended probability. In this work, the axiomatic\nsystem that synthesizes conventional probability and negative probability is\nconstructed in the form of combined probability. In a mathematically rigorous\nway, both theoretical concepts - combined probability and extended probability\n- stretch conventional probability so that it can takes negative values. After\nintroducing axioms for combined probability, we study its properties, as well\nas relations to extended probability and conventional probability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 May 2013 03:52:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-06"}
