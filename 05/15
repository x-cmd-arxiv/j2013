In this paper we develop a novel\nsymmetry-improved CJT formalism for consistently encoding global symmetries in\na loopwise expansion. In our formalism, the extremal solutions of the fields\nand propagators to a loopwise truncated CJT effective action are subject to\nadditional constraints given by the Ward identities due to global symmetries.\nBy considering a simple O(2) scalar model, we show that, unlike other methods,\nour approach satisfies a number of important field-theoretic properties.

This Kepler rate is significantly (99% confidence) lower than that\nderived from our Doppler survey, but the difference vanishes if only the single\nDoppler system (HIP 57274) with completely resolved orbits is considered. The\ndifference could also be explained by the exclusion of close binaries (without\ngiant planets) from the Doppler but not Kepler surveys, the effect of\nlong-period companions and stellar noise on the Doppler data, or an intrinsic\ndifference between the two populations. Our estimates for late K dwarfs bridge\nthose for solar-type stars and M dwarfs and support a positive trend with\nstellar mass. Small sample size precludes statements about finer structure,\ne.g. a \"shoulder\" in the distribution of giant planets with stellar mass.\nFuture surveys such as the Next Generation Transit Survey and the Transiting\nExoplanet Satellite Survey will ameliorate this deficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 May 2013 18:02:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

Briefly, a classifying topos for an internal\ngeometric theory $\\mathbb{T}$ in a topos $\\mathcal{E}$ is a topos\n$\\mathcal{E}[\\mathbb{T}]$ such that models of $\\mathbb{T}$ in any topos\n$\\mathcal{F}$ with a geometric morphism to $\\mathcal{E}$ are in one to one\ncorrespondence with geometric morphisms from $\\mathcal{F}$ to\n$\\mathcal{E}[\\mathbb{T}]$ over $\\mathcal{E}$. One useful technique for showing\nthat a higher order theory $\\mathcal{T}$ is preserved by geometric morphisms is\nto define an internal geometric theory $\\mathbb{T}$ of \"bad sets\" for\n$\\mathcal{T}$ and show that $\\mathcal{T}$ is equivalent to the higher order\ntheory which says \"the classifying topos for $\\mathbb{T}$ is degenerate\". We\nset up a deduction calculus for internal geometric theories and show that it\nproves a contradiction if and only if the classifying topos of that theory is\ndegenerate. We use this result to study a variant of the higher order theory of\nDedekind finite objects and the higher order theory of field objects considered\nas ring objects with no non-trivial ideals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 May 2013 19:06:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-15"}

Here, we summarize observational results from different groups to\nconclude that none of the characteristics that are typically used to define the\nNLSy1s as a distinct group - from the, nowadays called, Broad Line Seyfert 1s\n(BLSy1s) - is unique, nor ubiquitous of these particular sources, but shared by\nthe whole Type 1 AGN. Historically, the NLSy1s have been distinguished from the\nBLSy1s by the narrow width of the broad Hbeta emission line. The upper limit on\nthe full width at half maximum of this line is 2000 km/s for NLSy1s, while in\nBLSy1s it can be of several thousands of km/s. However, this border has been\narbitrarily set and does not correspond to the change of any physical property.\nAll observed parameters in Type 1 AGN cover continues ranges of values, which\ndoes not allow to infer the existence of two different kind of populations with\nFWHM(Hbeta,broad) = 2000 km/s as dividing point. We argue that the usage of\nthis velocity limit to define samples of NLSy1s galaxies - as it is usually\ndone in comparative studies -, together with the well known observational\nbiases, naturally favors the selection of sources with low black hole masses\nand high Eddington ratios that are hosted by blue spiral galaxies. Therefore\nselection biases might be responsible for the reported differences between\nNLSy1 and BLSy1 sources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 May 2013 20:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 Aug 2013 17:30:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-20"}

We consider\nseveral different mass-dependencies and efficiency factors for the accretion\nrate, as well as different mass ratios for the two components of the model.\n  The net effect of accretion is to accelerate mass segregation by increasing\nthe average mass $\\bar{m}$, since the relaxation time is inversely proportional\nto $\\bar{m}$. Under the assumption that the accretion rate increases with the\naccretor mass, there are two additional effects that accelerate mass\nsegregation. First, accretion acts to increase the range of any initial mass\nspectrum, quickly driving the heaviest members to even higher masses. Second,\naccretion acts to reduce the velocities of the accretors due to conservation of\nmomentum, and it is the heaviest members that are affected the most. Using our\ntwo-component model, we quantify these effects as a function of the accretion\nrate, the total cluster mass, and the component masses.

Such a cost has a profound influence on\nthe global structure of these networks which usually display a hierarchical\nspatial organization. The link between local constraints and large-scale\nstructure is however not elucidated and we introduce here a generic model for\nthe growth of spatial networks based on the general concept of cost benefit\nanalysis. This model depends essentially on one single scale and produces a\nfamily of networks which range from the star-graph to the minimum spanning tree\nand which are characterised by a continuously varying exponent.

Our model thus\nprovides the first building blocks for a better understanding of the evolution\nof spatial networks and their properties.

Interstellar ice is the main form of metal species in dark molecular\nclouds. Experiments and observations have shown that the ice is significantly\nprocessed after the freeze-out of molecules onto grains. The processing is\ncaused by cosmic-ray particles and cosmic-ray-induced UV photons. These\ntransformations are included in current astrochemical models only to a very\nlimited degree. Aims. We aim to establish a model of the \"cold\" chemistry in\ninterstellar ices and to evaluate its general impact on the composition of\ninterstellar ices. Methods. The ice was treated as consisting of two layers -\nthe surface and the mantle (or subsurface) layer. Subsurface chemical processes\nare described with photodissociation of ice species and binary reactions on the\nsurfaces of cavities inside the mantle. Hydrogen atoms and molecules can\ndiffuse between the layers. We also included deuterium chemistry. Results. The\nmodeling results show that the content of chemically bound H is reduced in\nsubsurface molecules by about 30 % on average. This promotes the formation of\nmore hydrogen-poor species in the ice. The enrichment of ice molecules with\ndeuterium is significantly reduced by the subsurface processes. On average, it\nfollows the gas-phase atomic D-to-H abundance ratio, with a delay. The delay\nproduced by the model is on the order of several Myr. Conclusions. The\nprocessing of ice may place new constraints on the production of deuterated\nspecies on grains. In a mantle with a two-layer structure the upper layer (CO)\nshould be processed substantially more intensively than the lower layer (H2O).\nChemical explosions in interstellar ice might not be an important process. They\ndestroy the structure of the mantle, which forms over long timescales. Besides,\nices may lack the high radical content needed for the explosions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 May 2013 21:35:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Jun 2013 08:37:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-14"}

Understanding the role of fragmentation is one of the most important\ncurrent questions of star formation. To better understand the process of star\nand cluster formation, we need to study in detail the physical structure and\nproperties of the parental molecular cloud. The Spokes cluster, or NGC 2264 D,\nis a rich protostellar cluster where previous N2H+(1-0) observations of its\ndense cores presented linewidths consistent with supersonic turbulence.\nHowever, the fragmentation of the most massive of these cores appears to have a\nscale length consistent with that of the thermal Jeans length, suggesting that\nturbulence was not dominant. Aims. These two results probe different density\nregimes. Our aim is to determine if there is subsonic or less-turbulent gas\n(than previously reported) in the Spokes cluster at higher densities. Methods.\nWe present APEX N2H+(3-2) and N2D+(3-2) observations of the NGC2264-D region to\nmeasure the linewidths and the deuteration fraction of the higher density gas.\nThe critical densities of the selected transitions are more than an order of\nmagnitude higher than that of N2H+(1-0). Results. We find that the N2H+(3-2)\nand N2D+(3-2) emission present significantly narrower linewidths than the\nemission from N2H+(1-0) for most cores. In two of the spectra, the nonthermal\ncomponent is close (within 1-sigma) to the sound speed. In addition, we find\nthat the three spatially segregated cores, for which no protostar had been\nconfirmed show the highest levels of deuteration. Conclusions. These results\nshow that the higher density gas, probed with N2H+ and N2D+(3-2), reveals more\nquiescent gas in the Spokes cluster than previously reported.

The common feature of the sequence\nof numbers considered here, which causes the impossibility of zeta\nregularization, is that the various Dirichlet series attached to such sequences\n- such as those which are sums over \"primes\" of $(\\mathrm{norm} \\ P)^{-s}$ have\na natural boundary, i.e., they cannot be continued beyond the line\n$\\mathrm{Re}(s)=0$. The main argument is that once the regularized determinant\nof a Laplacian is meromorphic in $s$, it follows that the series considered\nabove cannot be a regularized determinant. In other words we show that the\ngenerating functional of connected Schwinger functions of the associated\nquantum field theories cannot be constructed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 May 2013 02:28:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

However, even in the case of a single half-duplex relay, which\nseems fully characterized, implications are not clear. When all channels in the\nsystem are assumed to be independent and identically fading, a fixed schedule\nwhere the relay listens half of the total duration for communication and\ntransmits the second half combined with quantize-map-and-forward relaying\n(static QMF) is known to achieve the full-duplex performance [1]. However, when\nthere is no direct link between the source and the destination, a dynamic\ndecode-and-forward (DDF) strategy is needed [2]. It is not clear which one of\nthese two conclusions would carry to a less idealized setup, where the direct\nlink can be neither as strong as the other links nor fully non-existent.\n  In this paper, we provide a generalized diversity-multiplexing trade-off for\nthe half-duplex relay channel which accounts for different channel strengths\nand recovers the two earlier results as two special cases. We show that these\ntwo strategies are sufficient to achieve the diversity-multiplexing trade-off\nacross all channel configurations, by characterizing the best achievable\ntrade-off when channel state information (CSI) is only available at the\nreceivers (CSIR). However, for general relay networks we show that a\ngeneralization of these two schemes through a dynamic QMF strategy is needed to\nachieve optimal performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 May 2013 06:23:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-16"}

The new achievable region subsumes the most well known\nregion for the general problem, due to Venkataramani, Kramer and Goyal (VKG)\n[2].

Important protocols like superactivation of zero-capacity\nchannels and finite-size quantum cryptography that provides security against\nmost general attacks, require about 10 dB two-mode squeezing. Additionally,\nstable phase control mechanisms are necessary but are difficult to achieve\nbecause the total amount of optical loss to the entangled beams needs to be\nsmall. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a control scheme for two-mode\nsqueezed vacuum states at the telecommunication wavelength of 1550 nm.

We extend previous modeling of SN\nII-P radiation to include photospheric and nebular phases, as well as\nmulti-band light curves and spectra. Our treatment does not assume local\nthermodynamic equilibrium, is time dependent, treats explicitly the effects of\nline blanketing, and incorporates non-thermal processes. We find that the color\nproperties of SNe II-P require large model atoms for FeI and FeII, much larger\nthan adopted in Dessart & Hillier (2011). The color properties also imply RSG\nprogenitors of limited extent (~500Rsun) --- larger progenitor stars produce a\nSN II-P radiation that remains too blue for too long. This finding calls for a\nreduction of RSG radii, perhaps through a strengthening of convective energy\ntransport in RSG envelopes. Increased overshoot and rotation reduce the ratio\nof ejecta to helium-core mass, similarly to an increase in main-sequence mass,\nand thus complicate the inference ofprogenitor masses. In contrast to the great\nsensitivity on progenitor radius, SN II-P color evolution appears insensitive\nto variations in explosion energy. Finally, we document the numerous SN II-P\nsignatures that vary with progenitor metallicity, revealing their potential for\nmetallicity determinations in the nearby and distant Universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 May 2013 08:08:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

It has\nbeen found that most O-stars are multiples. HD 150 136 is the nearest system to\nEarth with >100 M_sol, and provides a unique opportunity to study an extremely\nmassive system. Recently, evidence for the existence of a third component in HD\n150 136, in addition to the tight spectroscopic binary that forms the main\ncomponent, was found in spectroscopic observations. Our aim was to image and\nobtain astrometric and photometric measurements of this component using long\nbaseline optical interferometry to further constrain the nature of this\ncomponent. We observed HD150136 with the near-infrared instrument AMBER\nattached to the ESO VLT Interferometer. The recovered closure phases are robust\nto systematic errors and provide unique information on the source asymmetry.\nTherefore, they are of crucial relevance for both image reconstruction and\nmodel fitting of the source structure. The third component in HD 150 136 is\nclearly detected in the high-quality data from AMBER. It is located at a\nprojected angular distance of 7.3 mas, or about 13 AU at the line-of-sight\ndistance of HD 150 136, at a position angle of 209 degrees East of North, and\nhas a flux ratio of 0.25 with respect to the inner binary. We resolved the\nthird component of HD 150 136 in J, H and K filters. The luminosity and color\nof the tertiary agrees with the predictions and shows that it is also an O\nmain-sequence star. The small measured angular separation indicates that the\ntertiary may be approaching the periastron of its orbit. These results, only\nachievable with long baseline near infrared interferometry, constitute the\nfirst step towards the understanding of the massive star formation mechanisms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 May 2013 11:22:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

A recent study\ntoward massive molecular outflows has revealed a decrease of the SiO line\nintensity as the object evolves. The present study aims at characterizing the\nvariation of the molecular outflow properties with time, and at studying the\nSiO excitation conditions in outflows associated with massive YSOs. We used the\nIRAM30m telescope to map 14 massive star-forming regions in the SiO(2-1),\nSiO(5-4) and HCO+(1-0) outflow lines, and in several dense gas and hot core\ntracers. Hi-GAL data was used to improve the spectral energy distributions and\nthe L/M ratio, which is believed to be a good indicator of the evolutionary\nstage of the YSO. We detect SiO and HCO+ outflow emission in all the sources,\nand bipolar structures in six of them. The outflow parameters are similar to\nthose found toward other massive YSOs. We find an increase of the HCO+ outflow\nenergetics as the object evolve, and a decrease of the SiO abundance with time,\nfrom 10^(-8) to 10^(-9). The SiO(5-4) to (2-1) line ratio is found to be low at\nthe ambient gas velocity, and increases as we move to high velocities,\nindicating that the excitation conditions of the SiO change with the velocity\nof the gas (with larger densities and/or temperatures for the high-velocity gas\ncomponent). The properties of the SiO and HCO+ outflow emission suggest a\nscenario in which SiO is largely enhanced in the first evolutionary stages,\nprobably due to strong shocks produced by the protostellar jet. As the object\nevolves, the power of the jet would decrease and so does the SiO abundance.\nDuring this process, however, the material surrounding the protostar would have\nbeen been swept up by the jet, and the outflow activity, traced by entrained\nmolecular material (HCO+), would increase with time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 May 2013 13:44:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

Also under\n$\\left(S_{1}^{n}/n\\geq a_{n}\\right) $ the dominating point property holds.\n  It also considers the case when the $X_{i}$'s are $\\mathbb{R}^{d}-$valued,\n$f$ is a real valued function defined on $\\mathbb{R}^{d}$ and the conditioning\nevent writes $\\left(U_{1}^{n}/n=a_{n}\\right) $ or $\\left(U_{1}^{n}/n\\geq\na_{n}\\right)$ with $U_{1}^{n}:=\\left(f(X_{1})+..+f(X_{n})\\right) /n$ and\n$f(X_{1})$ has a light tail distribution$.$ As a by-product some attention is\npaid to the estimation of high level sets of functions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 May 2013 14:04:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-16"}

The evaluation is\nbased on three performance metrics: estimator precision, sampling rate and\ncomputational complexity.

Here, we start building a new framework for the estimation of\nkey parameters of epidemic models based on statistics of diffusion processes\napproximating $(Z(t))$. First, \\previous results on the approximation of\ndensity-dependent $SIR$-like models by diffusion processes with small diffusion\ncoefficient $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}}$, where $N$ is the population size, are\ngeneralized to non-autonomous systems. Second, our previous inference results\non discretely observed diffusion processes with small diffusion coefficient are\nextended to time-dependent diffusions.

Finally, performances and robustness of our estimators with respect\nto various parameters such as $R_0$ (the basic reproduction number), $N$, $n$\nare investigated on simulations. Two models, $SIR$ and $SIRS$, corresponding to\nsingle and recurrent outbreaks, respectively, are used to simulate data.

For the first time, theoretically\ncalculated dust production rates of AGB stars are compared to those derived\nfrom IR observations of AGB stars for the entire galaxy. We find good agreement\nwithin scatter of various observational estimates. We show that the majority of\nsilicate and iron grains in the present stardust population originate from a\nsmall population of intermediate-mass stars consisting of only about 4% of the\ntotal number of stars, whereas in the Solar neighbourhood they originate from\nlow-mass stars. With models of the lifecycle of stardust grains in the ISM we\nconfirm a large discrepancy between dust input from stars and the existing\ninterstellar dust mass in the LMC reported in Matsuura et al. 2009.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 May 2013 15:24:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

This\nmixing simultaneously contributes to the muon mass. We show that the\ncorrelation between contributions to the muon mass and muon g-2 is controlled\nby the mass of the neutrino originating from the doublet L. Positive\ncorrelation, simultaneously explaining both measured values, requires this mass\nbelow 200 GeV. The decay rate of the Higgs boson to muon pairs is modified and,\nin the region of the parameter space that can explain the muon anomalous\nmagnetic moment within one standard deviation, it ranges from 0.5 to 24 times\nthe standard model prediction. In the same scenario, $h \\to \\gamma \\gamma$ can\nbe enhanced or lowered by ~50% from the standard model prediction.

The most\nfavorable of reviews did not see a method but a collection of techniques. Be\nthat as it may, the process used, is described in the paper, Windtalking\nComputers. This paper is about the steganographic method described, the\ncryptanalysis efforts of that method and; a real world application of that\nmethod as an answer to the increasing problem of password file hacking. The\npremise is that the technique is a variant of one time pad, using a novel way\nto produce one time pad output for digital input. There is no record in the\nliterature of such a method being used for encryption at all. Digital\nencryption generally treats the letters of the plaintext as a binary number and\ndoes some mathematical computation to produce ciphertext. The idea of inserting\nbits with a random generated key is new. Therefore (because a uniquely random\ngenerated key is used), the encryption is cryptanalytically unbreakable and/or\ncomputationally secure and/or information theoretic. An academic version was\nmade. Challenges for decryption have not produced to-date a decryption.\nAdvantages and disadvantages of the method are discussed.\n  Hackers are constantly penetrating networks and stealing password files.\nWhich, once in possession of a password file, hackers individually or\ncollectively with distributed processing over the Internet, decrypt the values\nof the hash passwords. Thereby gaining access to systems. This problem has\nbecome sufficiently significant for CAESAR (Competition for Authenticated\nEncryption: Security, Applicability, and Robustness) to make calls for papers\nfor solutions. Herein is one proposed solution. While one time pad presents a\nproblem being computationally intensive, for the relatively short length of\npasswords, the cost of computation may be cost effective for the security\nprovided.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 May 2013 22:02:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-04"}

The angle, or its complement, is given by half the area\nof a spherical triangle in the case of three singular points, or half the area\nof a lune in the case of two singular points. Both are fundamental regions\nwhere the automorphic function takes a value only once, and a linear-fractional\ntransformation tessellates the plane in replicas of the fundamental region. The\ncondition that the homologues of the poles, representing vertices, be angles\nplaces restrictions on quantum numbers which are no longer integers, for,\notherwise, the phase factors would become unity. Restriction must be made to\nregular singular points for only then will solutions to the differential\nequation be rational functions so that the covering group will be cyclic and\nthe covering space be a \"spiral staircase\". Many of the equations of\nmathematical physics, with essential singularities, become Fuchsian\ndifferential equations, with regular singularities, at zero kinetic energy.\nExamples of geometric phase include the phasor, the Pancharatnam phase of beams\nof polarized light in different states, the Aharanov-Bohm phase, and angular\nmomentum with centripetal \"attraction\". In the latter example, the phase is\none-half the area of the lune, which disappears when the pole at infinity\nbecomes an essential singularity thereby recovering the Schr\\\"odinger equation.\nThe behavior of an automorphic function at a limit point on the boundary is\nanalogous to the confluence of two regular singularities in a linear\nsecond-order differential equation to produce an essential singularity at\ninfinity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 May 2013 09:46:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-21"}
