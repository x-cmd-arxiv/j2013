Each cell (i, j) of a protein\ncontact map states whether the atoms (nodes) i and j are within some Euclidean\ndistance from each other. We examined the radius one Moore neighborhood\nsurrounding each cell (i, j) where j > (i + 2) in complete protein contact maps\nby mutating them one at a time. We found that the particular configuration of a\nneighborhood is generally (97%) optimal in the sense that no other\nconfiguration could maintain or improve upon existing local and global\nefficiencies of the nodes residing in a neighborhood. Local efficiency of a\nnode is directly related to its clustering measure. Global efficiency of a node\nis inversely related to its distance to other nodes in the network. This\nfeature of the Moore neighborhood in complete protein contact maps may explain\nhow protein residue networks are able to form long-range links to reduce\naverage path length while maintaining a high level of clustering throughout the\nprocess of small-world formation, and could suggest new approaches to protein\ncontact map prediction. Effectively, the problem of protein contact map\nprediction is transformed to one of maximizing the number of optimal\nneighborhoods. By comparison, Moore neighborhoods in protein contact maps with\nrandomized long-range links are less optimal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 May 2013 16:00:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-07"}

The case of quadratic drag is substantially\nmore complex than the linear case, as it nonlinearly couples both components of\nthe momentum equation. Careful screening of the literature on this classical\ntopic showed that, unexpectedly, the solutions reported do not directly provide\nthe particle velocity as a function of time but use auxiliary quantities or\napply to special cases only. No explicit solution using elementary operations\non analytical expressions is known for a general trajectory.

We find that intermediate delays enhance network reciprocity\nbecause of a decelerated invasion of defectors, who are unable to reap the same\nhigh short-term benefits as they do in the absence of delayed distribution.\nLong delays, however, introduce a risk because the large accumulated wealth\nmight fall into the wrong hands. Indeed, as soon as the curvature of a\ncooperative cluster turns negative, the engulfed defectors can collect the\nheritage of many generations of cooperators, and by doing so start a waning\nmoon pattern that nullifies the benefits of decelerated invasion. Accidental\nmeeting points of growing cooperative clusters may also act as triggers for the\nwaning moon effect, thus linking the success of cooperators with their\npropensity to fail in a rather bizarre way.

However, the high computational cost of the existing geodesic\nalgorithms means that they are not practical for large-scale models or\ntime-critical applications. To tackle this challenge, we propose the parallel\nChen-Han (or PCH) algorithm, which extends the classic Chen-Han (CH) discrete\ngeodesic algorithm to the parallel setting. The original CH algorithm and its\nvariant both lack a parallel solution because the windows (a key data structure\nthat carries the shortest distance in the wavefront propagation) are maintained\nin a strict order or a tightly coupled manner, which means that only one window\nis processed at a time. We propose dividing the CH's sequential algorithm into\nfour phases, window selection, window propagation, data organization, and\nevents processing so that there is no data dependence or conflicts in each\nphase and the operations within each phase can be carried out in parallel. The\nproposed PCH algorithm is able to propagate a large number of windows\nsimultaneously and independently. We also adopt a simple yet effective strategy\nto control the total number of windows. We implement the PCH algorithm on\nmodern GPUs (such as Nvidia GTX 580) and analyze the performance in detail.

These calculations are applied to interpret\nnull results of the recent magnetic surveys of massive stars. The intensity and\ncircular polarization spectra of early-type stars are simulated using detailed\npolarized radiative transfer calculations with LTE model atmospheres.

However, the\nposterior transit probability depends not only on the prior probability\ndistribution of i but also on the prior probability distribution of the\ncompanion mass M_c. In general, the posterior can be larger or smaller than the\nprior transit probability. We derive analytic expressions for the posterior\ntransit probability assuming a power-law form for the distribution of true\nmasses with exponent alpha. For low transit probabilities, these probabilities\nreduce to a constant multiplicative factor of the corresponding prior transit\nprobability. The prior and posterior probabilities are equal for alpha = -1,\nwhereas the posterior transit probability is ~1.5 times larger and ~4/pi larger\nfor for alpha = -3 and alpha = -2, but is less than the prior for alpha >= 0,\nand can be arbitrarily small for alpha > 1. We also calculate the posterior\ntransit probability in different mass regimes for two physically-motivated mass\ndistributions of companions around Sun-like stars, finding that the posterior\nis likely higher for Super-Earths, Neptunes and Super-Jupiters.

Individual hyperfine lines can be\nstrongly boosted or suppressed. In low-mass star-forming cloud observations,\nthis could possibly lead to large errors in the calculation of opacity and\nexcitation temperature, while in massive star-forming clouds, where the\nhyperfine lines are blended due to turbulent broadening, errors will arise in\ninfall measurements that are based on the separation of the peaks in a\nself-absorbed profile.

The mass eigenstate conversions and elastic scattering are\nrelated but different processes, hence the conversion $S$-matrix elements can\nbe arbitrarily large even when the elastic scattering $S$-matrix elements\nvanish. The conversions are efficient when the mass eigenstates are\nwell-separated in space but suppressed if their wave-packets overlap; the\nsuppression is most severe for mass-degenerate eigenstates in flat space-time.\nThe mass eigenstate conversions can lead to an interesting process, called\n`quantum evaporation,' in which mixed particles, initially confined deep inside\na gravitational potential well and scattering only off each other, can escape\nfrom it without extra energy supply leaving nothing behind inside the potential\nat $t\\to \\infty$.

Our method generalizes a previous construction of Bernardi by loosening\nits conditions of applications so as to include annular maps, that is maps\nembedded in the plane with a root face different from the outer face.\n  The bijective construction presented here relies deeply on the theory of\n\\alpha-orientations introduced by Felsner, and in particular on the existence\nof minimal and accessible orientations. Since most of the families of maps can\nbe characterized by such orientations, our generic bijective method is proved\nto capture as special cases all previously known bijections involving\nblossoming trees: for example Eulerian maps, m-Eulerian maps, non separable\nmaps and simple triangulations and quadrangulations of a k-gon. Moreover, it\nalso permits to obtain new bijective constructions for bipolar orientations and\nd-angulations of girth d of a k-gon.\n  As for applications, each specialization of the construction translates into\nenumerative by-products, either via a closed formula or via a recursive\ncomputational scheme. Besides, for every family of maps described in the paper,\nthe construction can be implemented in linear time. It yields thus an effective\nway to encode and generate planar maps.\n  In a recent work, Bernardi and Fusy introduced another unified bijective\nscheme, we adopt here a different strategy which allows us to capture different\nbijections. These two approaches should be seen as two complementary ways of\nunifying bijections between planar maps and decorated trees.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 May 2013 20:07:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Oct 2014 07:33:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 12 May 2015 13:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-27"}

Even in the\nturbulent case, we find no significant vertical flow of mass into the Hill\nsphere. The outer parts of the circumplanetary disk are shown to rotate\nsignificantly below Keplerian speed, independent of viscosity, while the\ncircumplanetary disk density (therefore the angular momentum) increases with\nviscosity. For a simulation of a magnetized turbulent disk, where the global\naveraged alpha stress is $\\alpha_{MHD}=10^{-3}$, we find the accretion rate\nonto the planet to be $\\dot{M}\\approx 2\\times10^{-6}M_{J}yr^{-1}$ for a gap\nsurface density of $12 g cm^{-2}$.

In suitable elliptic\ncoordinates the vertical and the horizontal subsystems are integrated such that\nthe resulting extremal trajectories are parametrized by the Jacobi elliptic\nfunctions. Qualitative analysis reveals that the projections of normal extremal\ntrajectories on the xy-plane have cusps and inflection points. The vertical\nsubsystem being a generalized pendulum admits reflection symmetries that are\nused to obtain a characterization of the Maxwell strata.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 May 2013 21:50:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 May 2013 04:02:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 18 Jul 2013 16:47:13 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 6 May 2014 16:46:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-08"}

It is spectral order accurate in space and\nsecond-order accurate in time, and conserves the mass in the discrete level.\nExtensive numerical results are reported to demonstrate the efficiency and\naccuracy of the new numerical method. Finally, the numerical method is applied\nto test the dynamical laws of rotating BECs such as the dynamics of condensate\nwidth, angular momentum expectation and center-of-mass, and to investigate\nnumerically the dynamics and interaction of quantized vortex lattices in\nrotating BECs without/with the long-range dipole-dipole interaction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 May 2013 01:47:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-21"}

In this paper we give a fast computer\nsearch algorithm to find good classical digital nets suitable for interlaced\ncomponents by using polynomial lattice point sets.\n  We consider certain weighted Sobolev spaces of smoothness of arbitrarily high\norder, and derive an upper bound on the mean square worst-case error for\ndigitally shifted higher order digital nets.

Fast construction\nusing the fast Fourier transform requires the construction cost of $O(dsN \\log\nN)$ operations using $O(N)$ memory, where $N$ is the number of points and $s$\nis the dimension. This implies a significant reduction in the construction cost\nas compared to higher order polynomial lattice point sets.

Knowing only the\ncommunication, how many direct queries of the value of the common randomness\nwill resolve it? A general upper bound, valid for arbitrary signal alphabets,\nis developed for the number of such queries by using a query strategy that\napplies to all common randomness and associated communication. When the\nunderlying signals are independent and identically distributed repetitions of m\ncorrelated random variables, the number of queries can be exponential in signal\nlength. For this case, the mentioned upper bound is tight and leads to a\nsingle-letter formula for the largest query exponent, which coincides with the\nsecret key capacity of a corresponding multiterminal source model. In fact, the\nupper bound constitutes a strong converse for the optimum query exponent, and\nimplies also a new strong converse for secret key capacity.

In this model, we use the reduced\nhierarchy equations of motion in the Wigner space representation. These\nequations represent a generalization of the Gaussian-Markovian quantum\nFokker-Planck equation introduced by Tanimura and Wolynes (1991), which was\nformulated to study non-Markovian and non-perturbative thermal effects at\nfinite temperature. This formalism allows us to treat both the classical limit\nand the tunneling regimes, and it is helpful for identifying purely quantum\nmechanical effects through the time evolution of the Wigner distribution. We\ncarried out extensive calculations of the classical and quantum currents for\nvarious temperatures, coupling strengths, and barrier heights. Our results\nreveal that at low temperature, while the quantum current is larger than the\nclassical current in the case of a high barrier, the opposite is true in the\ncase of a low barrier. We find that this behavior results from the fact that\nthe tunneling enhances the current in the case of a high barrier, while it\nsuppresses the current in the case of a low barrier. This is because the effect\nof the ratchet potential is weak in the case of a low barrier, due to the large\ndispersion of the distribution introduced by tunneling. This causes the\nspatio-temporal asymmetry, which is necessary for ratchet current, to be weak,\nand as a result, the net current is suppressed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 May 2013 04:38:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-22"}

We consider two types of planetary configurations\norbiting Sun-like stars: (i) five Jupiter-mass planets in the semi-major axis\nrange 1-42 AU orbiting a Solar mass star, with orbits that are initially\nco-planar, circular, and separated by 10 mutual Hill radii, and (ii) the four\ngas giants of our Solar system. Planets with short orbital periods are not\ndirectly affected by encountering stars. However, secular evolution of\nperturbed systems may result in the ejection of the innermost planets or in\nphysical collisions of the innermost planets with the host star, up to many\nthousands of years after a stellar encounter. The simulations of the Solar\nsystem-like systems indicate that Saturn, Uranus and Neptune are affected by\nboth direct interactions with encountering stars, as well as planet-planet\nscattering. Jupiter, on the other hand, is almost only affected by direct\nencounters with neighbouring stars, as its mass is too large to be\nsubstantially perturbed by the other three planets. Our results indicate that\nstellar encounters can account for the apparent scarcity of exoplanets in star\nclusters, not only for those on wide-orbit that are directly affected by\nstellar encounters, but also planets close to the star which can disappear long\nafter a stellar encounter has perturbed the planetary system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 May 2013 05:45:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

Our method\nprovides security for the transmission sessions against computational\nbrute-force attacks and also weakly security in information theoretic sense. As\nthe broadcast channel is assumed to be erroneous, the missing coded packets\nshould be recovered in some way. We consider two different scenarios. In the\nfirst scenario the missing packets are retransmitted by the base station\n(centralized). In the second scenario the clients cooperate with each other by\nexchanging packets (decentralized). In both scenarios, network coding\ntechniques are exploited to increase the total throughput. For the case of\ncentralized retransmissions we provide an analytical approximation for the\nthroughput performance of instantly decodable network coded (IDNC)\nretransmissions as well as numerical experiments. For the decentralized\nscenario, we propose a new IDNC based retransmission method where its\nperformance is evaluated via simulations and analytical approximation.\nApplication of this method is not limited to our special problem and can be\ngeneralized to a new class of problems introduced in this paper as the\ncooperative index coding problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 May 2013 05:55:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-08"}

The coupling to this impurity is not\nscale invariant, and the physics involves a crossover between weak and strong\ncoupling regimes. While the impurity contribution to the entanglement has been\ncomputed numerically in the past, little is known analytically about it, since\nin particular the methods of conformal invariance cannot be applied because of\nthe presence of a crossover length. We show in this paper that the small\ncoupling expansion of the entanglement entropy in this problem is quite\ngenerally plagued by strong infrared divergences, implying a non-perturbative\ndependence on the coupling. The large coupling expansion turns out to be better\nbehaved, thanks to powerful results from the boundary CFT formulation and, in\nsome cases, the underlying integrability of the problem. However, it is clear\nthat this expansion does not capture well the crossover physics. In the\nintegrable case -- which includes problems such as an XXZ chain with a modified\nlink, the interacting resonant level model or the anisotropic Kondo model -- a\nnon perturbative approach is in principle possible using form-factors. We adapt\nin this paper the ideas of [1,2] to the gapless case and show that, in the\nrather simple case of the resonant level model, and after some additional\nrenormalizations, the form factors approach yields remarkably accurate results\nfor the entanglement all the way from short to large distances.

The events during\nthe pre-eruption phase, i.e., before the X1.8 flare, are characterized by\nlocalized episodes of energy release occurring in the vicinity of an active\nregion filament which produced intense heating along with non-thermal emission.\nA few minutes before the eruption, the filament undergoes an activation phase\nduring which it slowly rises with a speed of ~12 km/s. The filament eruption is\naccompanied with an X1.8 flare during which multiple HXR bursts are observed up\nto 100-300 keV energies. We observe a bright and elongated coronal structure\nsimultaneously in E(UV) and 50-100 keV HXR images underneath the expanding\nfilament during the period of HXR bursts which provides strong evidence for\nongoing magnetic reconnection.

Recent lattice QCD calculations predict a\nrich spectrum of hybrid mesons that have both exotic and non-exotic $J^{PC}$,\ncorresponding to $q\\bar{q}$ states ($q=u,$ $d,$ or $s$) coupled with a gluonic\nfield. A thorough study of the hybrid spectrum, including the identification of\nthe isovector triplet, with charges 0 and $\\pm1$, and both isoscalar members,\n$|s\\bar{s}\\ >$ and $|u\\bar{u}\\ > + |d\\bar{d}\\ >$, for each predicted hybrid\ncombination of $J^{PC}$, may only be achieved by conducting a systematic\namplitude analysis of many different hadronic final states. Detailed studies of\nthe performance of the \\gx detector have indicated that identification of\nparticular final states with kaons is possible using the baseline detector\nconfiguration. The efficiency of kaon detection coupled with the relatively\nlower production cross section for particles containing hidden strangeness will\nrequire a high intensity run in order for analyses of such states to be\nfeasible. We propose to collect a total of 200 days of physics analysis data at\nan average intensity of $5\\times 10^7$ tagged photons on target per second.\nThis data sample will provide an order of magnitude statistical improvement\nover the initial GlueX running, which will allow us to begin a program of\nstudying mesons and baryons containing strange quarks. In addition, the\nincreased intensity will permit us to study reactions that may have been\nstatistically limited in the initial phases of GlueX. Overall, this will lead\nto a significant increase in the potential for \\gx to make key experimental\nadvances in our knowledge of hybrid mesons and excited $\\Xi$ baryons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 May 2013 14:04:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-08"}

We investigate the asymptotic behaviors of radial Dirac\nwave functions. Spherical square well potentials are employed in which the PSS\nbreaking part in the Jost function can be well isolated. By examining the zeros\nof Jost functions corresponding to small components of the radial Dirac wave\nfunctions, general properties of the PSS are analyzed. By examining the Jost\nfunction, the occurrence of intruder orbitals is explained and it is possible\nto trace continuously the PSS partners from the PSS limit to the case with a\nfinite potential depth. The dependence of the PSS in resonances as well as in\nbound states on the potential depth is investigated systematically. We find a\nthreshold effect in the energy splitting and an anomaly in the width splitting\nof pseudospin partners when the depth of the single particle potential varies\nfrom zero to a finite value. The conservation and the breaking of the PSS in\nresonant states and bound states share some similar properties.

Issues related to nonconvexities, both in\nterms of dosimetric goals and the fact that the mapping from controllable\nhardware parameters to patient doses is usually nonconvex, are discussed at\nlength since nonconvexities have a large impact on practical solution\ntechniques for Pareto surface construction and navigation. A general planning\nstrategy is recommended which handles the issue of nonconvexity by first\nfinding an ideal Pareto surface with radiation delivered from many preset\nangles. This can be cast as a convex optimization problem. Once a high quality\nsolution is selected from the Pareto surface, a sparse version (which can mean\nfewer beams, fewer segments, less leaf travel for arc therapy techniques, etc.)\nis obtained using an appropriate sparsification heuristic. We end by discussing\nissues of efficiency regarding the planning and the delivery of radiation\ntherapy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 May 2013 14:54:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-08"}

CMC surfaces of revolution, classified by Charles Delaunay in 1841,\ninclude the 2-sphere, the cylinder, the vanishing mean curvature catenoid (a\nminimal surface) and the richer and less investigated unduloid and nodoid.

In this case the stretching process takes one through a complicated\nsequence of Delaunay surfaces each with different geometrical parameters\nincluding the aspect ratio, mean curvature and maximal Gaussian curvature.\nUnduloids, catenoids and nodoids all appear in this process. Defect motifs in\nthe ground state evolve from dislocations at the boundary to dislocations in\nthe interior to pleats and scars in the interior and then isolated 7-fold\ndisclinations in the interior as the capillary bridge narrows at the waist\n(equator) and the maximal (negative) Gaussian curvature grows. We also check\ntheoretical predictions that the isolated disclinations are present in the\nground state when the surface contains a geodesic disc with integrated Gaussian\ncurvature exceeding -pi/3.

The SQHA shows that the open quantum mechanical behavior is\nmaintained on a distance shorter than the theory-defined quantum correlation\nlength (lc). When, the physical length of the problem is larger than lc, the\nmodel shows that the quantum (potential) interactions may have a finite range\nof interaction maintaining the non-local behavior on a finite distance quantum\nnon-locality length lq. The present work shows that when the mean molecular\ndistance is larger than the quantum non-locality length we have a classical\nphases (gas and van der Waals liquids) while when the mean molecular distance\nbecomes smaller than lq or than lc we have phases such as the solid crystal or\nthe superfluid one, respectively, that show quantum characteristics. The model\nagrees with Lindemann empirical law (and explains it), for the mean square\ndeviation of atom from the equilibrium position at melting point of crystal,\nand shows a connection between the maximum density at the He lambda point and\nthat one near the water-ice solidification point.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 May 2013 09:36:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 May 2013 09:49:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-08"}

Producing mock PFOF group catalogs under a variety of\nphotometric redshift accuracies ({\\sigma}{\\Delta}z/(1+zs)), we find that\ncatalog purities and completenesses from ``good' {\\sigma}{\\Delta}z/(1+zs)) ~\n0.01) to ``poor' {\\sigma}{\\Delta}z/(1+zs)) ~ 0.07) photo-zs gradually degrade\nrespectively from 77% and 70% to 52% and 47%. To avoid model dependency of the\nmock for use on observational data we apply a ``subset optimization' approach,\nusing spectroscopic-redshift group data from the target field to train the\ngroup finder for application to that field, as an alternative method for the\ngrouping optimization. We demonstrate this approach using these\nspectroscopically identified groups as the training set, i.e. zCOSMOS groups\nfor PFOF searches within PS1 Medium Deep Field04 (PS1MD04) and DEEP2 EGS groups\nfor searches in PS1MD07. We ultimately apply PFOF to four datasets spanning the\nphoto-z uncertainty range from 0.01 to 0.06 in order to quantify the dependence\nof group recovery performance on photo-z accuracy. We find purities and\ncompletenesses calculated from observational datasets broadly agree with their\nmock analogues. Further tests of the PFOF algorithm are performed via matches\nto X-ray clusters identified within the PS1MD04 and COSMOS footprints. Across\nover a decade in group mass, we find PFOF groups match ~85% of X-ray clusters\nin COSMOS and PS1MD04, but at a lower statistical significance in the latter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 May 2013 13:09:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-21"}

Product\nratings are important since they affect how well a product will be adopted by\nthe market. The challenge is that we only have {\\em \"partial information\"} on\nthese ratings: Each user provides ratings to only a \"{\\em small subset of\nproducts}\". Under this partial information setting, we explore a number of\nfundamental questions: What is the \"{\\em minimum number of ratings}\" a product\nneeds so one can make a reliable evaluation of its quality? How users' {\\em\nmisbehavior} (such as {\\em cheating}) in product rating may affect the\nevaluation result? To answer these questions, we present a formal mathematical\nmodel of product evaluation based on partial information. We derive theoretical\nbounds on the minimum number of ratings needed to produce a reliable indicator\nof a product's quality. We also extend our model to accommodate users'\nmisbehavior in product rating. We carry out experiments using both synthetic\nand real-world data (from TripAdvisor, Amazon and eBay) to validate our model,\nand also show that using the \"majority rating rule\" to aggregate product\nratings, it produces more reliable and robust product evaluation results than\nthe \"average rating rule\".\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 May 2013 08:04:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-09"}

It is\ndemonstrated that the principle effect of inadequate resolution is on the\ncoronal density. An underresolved loop typically has a peak density of at least\na factor of two lower than a resolved loop subject to the same heating, with\nlarger discrepencies in the decay phase. The temperature for under-resolved\nloops is also lower indicating that lack of resolution does not \"bottle up\" the\nheat flux in the corona. Energy is conserved in the models to under 1% in all\ncases, indicating that this is not responsible for the low density. Instead, we\nargue that in under-resolved loops the heat flux \"jumps across\" the transition\nregion to the dense chromosphere from which it is radiated rather than heating\nand ablating transition region plasma. This emphasises the point that the\ninteraction between corona and chromosphere occurs only through the medium of\nthe transition region. Implications for three dimensional magnetohydrodynamic\ncoronal models are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 May 2013 01:49:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}
