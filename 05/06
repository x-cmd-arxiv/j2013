In this paper, we propose a way to give a modified standard\nmodel (with 48 two-component Weyl fermions) a non-perturbative definition by\nembedding the modified standard model into a SO(10) chiral gauge theory and\nthen putting the SO(10) chiral gauge theory on a 3D spatial lattice with a\ncontinuous time. Such a non-perturbatively defined standard model is a\nHamiltonian quantum theory with a finite-dimensional Hilbert space for a finite\nspace volume. Using the defining connection between gauge anomalies and the\nsymmetry-protected topological orders, we show that any chiral gauge theory can\nbe non-perturbatively defined by putting it on a lattice in the same dimension,\nas long as the chiral gauge theory is free of all anomalies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 May 2013 19:34:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Jul 2013 14:38:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 12 Sep 2013 07:42:04 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 13 Mar 2015 12:39:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-16"}

Standard statistical theory shows that the normalized MLE is\nasymptotically normally distributed with covariance matrix being the inverse of\nthe Fisher information matrix (FIM) at the unknown parameter. Two commonly used\nestimates for the covariance of the MLE are the inverse of the observed FIM\n(the same as the inverse Hessian of the negative log-likelihood) and the\ninverse of the expected FIM (the same as the inverse FIM). Both of the observed\nand expected FIM are evaluated at the MLE from the sample data. In this\ndissertation, we demonstrate that, under reasonable conditions similar to\nstandard MLE conditions, the inverse expected FIM outperforms the inverse\nobserved FIM under a mean squared error criterion. Specifically, in an\nasymptotic sense, the inverse expected FIM (evaluated at the MLE) has no\ngreater mean squared error with respect to the true covariance matrix than the\ninverse observed FIM (evaluated at the MLE) at the element level.

The use\nof integral field spectroscopy enables us to obtain both spatial and spectral\ninformation of the explosion site, allowing the identification of the parent\nstellar population of the supernova progenitor star. The spectrum of the parent\npopulation provides metallicity determination via strong-line method and age\nestimation obtained via comparison with simple stellar population (SSP) models.\nWe adopt this information as the metallicity and age of the supernova\nprogenitor, under the assumption that it was coeval with the parent stellar\npopulation. The age of the star corresponds to its lifetime, which in turn\ngives the estimate of its initial mass. With this method we were able to\ndetermine both the metallicity and initial (ZAMS) mass of the progenitor stars\nof the type Ib and Ic supernovae. We found that on average SN Ic explosion\nsites are more metal-rich and younger than SN Ib sites. The initial mass of the\nprogenitors derived from parent stellar population age suggests that SN Ic have\nmore massive progenitors than SN Ib. In addition, we also found indication that\nsome of our SN progenitors are less massive than ~25 Msun, indicating that they\nmay have been stars in a close binary system that have lost their outer\nenvelope via binary interactions to produce Ib/c supernovae, instead of single\nWolf-Rayet stars.

Aims: We intended to find the X-ray coronal counterpart of the\nchromospheric cycle for i Hor. This represents the first X-ray cycle observed\nin an active star, as well as the paradigm of the first coronal cycles in the\nlife of a solar-like star. Methods: We monitored i Hor with XMM-Newton\nobservations spanning almost two years. The spectra of each observation are fit\nwith two-temperature coronal models to study the long-term variability of the\nstar. Results: We find a cyclic behavior in X-rays very similar to the\ncontemporaneous chromospheric cycle. The continuous chromospheric monitoring\nfor more than three cycle lengths shows a trend toward decreasing amplitude,\napparently modulated by a longer term trend. The second cycle is disrupted\nprior to reaching its maximum, followed by a brief episode of chaotic\nvariability before the cyclic behavior resumes, only to be disrupted again\nafter slightly more than one cycle. Conclusions: We confirm the presence of an\nactivity cycle of ~1.6 yr in i Hor both in X-rays and Ca II H&K. It is likely\nsubject to the modulation of a longer, not yet constrained second cycle. The\n1.6 yr cycle is the shortest coronal one observed to date, and i Hor represents\nthe most active star for which a coronal activity cycle has been found.

The number of the domains is\ndetermined by the strength of the SO coupling. The modes are constructed\nanalytically in the weakly nonlinear system. The dynamical stability of the\nmodes is investigated by means of the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations and direct\nsimulations. A notable result is that the multi-domain-wall (DW) structures are\nstable, alternating between odd and even shapes, while the simplest single-DW\nstructure is unstable. Thus, the system features a transition to the complex\nground states under the action of the SO coupling. The addition of the Zeeman\nsplitting transforms the odd modes into asymmetric ones via spontaneous\nsymmetry breaking. The results suggest possibilities for switching the binary\nsystem between states with opposite (pseudo) magnetization by external fields,\nand realization of similar stable states and dynamical effects in solid-state\nand nonlinear-optical settings emulated by the SO-coupled BECs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 May 2013 11:13:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 Jun 2013 11:00:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 5 Jul 2013 15:31:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

Our sample\nconsists of 20 GRB absorbers and a comparison sample of 72 QSO-DLAs with\nredshift 1.2 < z < 4.0 and down to Z = 0.002 Z_Sol metallicities. The\ndust-to-metal ratio in QSO- and GRB-DLAs increases both with metallicity and\nmetal column density, spanning ~10--110% of the Galactic value and pointing to\na non universal dust-to-metal ratio. The low values of dust-to-metal ratio\nsuggest that low-metallicity systems have lower dust fractions than typical\nspiral galaxies and perhaps that the dust in these systems is produced\ninefficiently, i.e. by grain growth in the low-metallicity regime with\nnegligible contribution from supernovae (SNe) and asymptotic giant branch (AGB)\nstars. On the other hand, some GRB- and QSO-DLAs show high dust-to-metal ratio\nvalues out to z ~ 4, requiring rapid dust production, such as in SN ejecta, but\nalso in AGB winds and via grain growth for the highest metallicity systems.\nGRB-DLAs overall follow the dust-to-metal-ratio properties of QSO-DLAs, GRBs\nprobing up to larger column and volume densities.

To\ndemonstrate the usability of the compiler, we have implemented several BLAS-1\nand BLAS-2 routines and show how the performance of their sequences can be\nimproved by fusions.\n  Compared to similar sequences using CUBLAS, our compiler is able to generate\ncode that is up to 2.61x faster for the examples tested.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 May 2013 13:32:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Jul 2013 09:37:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-13"}

The work is focused on revealing of the radial IMF\ncomponent (Br) variations with heliocentric distance and latitude as seen by\nUlysses. It was found out that |Br| decreases as ~r^-5/3 in the ecliptic plane\nvicinity (10 deg. of latitude). This is consistent with the previous results\nobtained on the basis of five spacecraft in-ecliptic measurements (Khabarova,\nObridko, 2012). The difference between the experimentally found (r^-5/3) and\ncommonly used (r^-2) radial dependence of Br may lead to mistakes in the IMF\nrecalculations from point to point in the heliosphere.

This exploratory approach has three main goals.\n  Our first goal is to extend the search space of greedy merging algorithms to\nthe set of all partitions spanned by a certain hierarchy, and to cast the\nsegmentation as a selection problem within this space. In this way we increase\nthe number of tested partitions and thus we potentially improve the\nsegmentation results. In addition, this space is considerably smaller than the\nspace of all possible partitions, thus we still keep the complexity controlled.\n  Our second goal aims to improve the locality of region merging algorithms,\nwhich usually merge pairs of neighboring regions. In this work, we overcome\nthis limitation by introducing a validation procedure for complete partitions,\nrather than for pairs of regions.\n  The third goal is to perform an exhaustive experimental evaluation\nmethodology in order to provide reproducible results.\n  Finally, we embed the selection process on a statistical A Contrario\nframework which allows us to have only one free parameter related to the\ndesired scale.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 May 2013 14:17:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-07"}

Another one has to do with the lack of\nrepresentativeness of universities' disciplinary profiles as they usually\nprovide a unique table. Although some rankings offer a great coverage and\nothers offer league tables by fields, no international ranking does both. In\norder to surpass such limitation from a research policy viewpoint, this paper\nanalyzes the possibility of using national rankings in order to complement\ninternational rankings.

Interestingly, we find that there is no qubit-qubit entanglement for\nthe ground state if the qubit-oscillator coupling strength is large enough.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 May 2013 15:41:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 17 May 2013 13:42:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 21 Oct 2013 15:05:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-30"}
