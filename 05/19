These versions are obtained by\napplying dimensionality reduction to the original training set using different\nvalues of the input parameters. This construction meets both the diversity and\naccuracy criteria which are required to construct an ensemble classifier where\nthe former criterion is obtained by the various input parameter values and the\nlatter is achieved due to the decorrelation and noise reduction properties of\ndimensionality reduction. In order to classify a test sample, it is first\nembedded into the dimension reduced space of each individual classifier by\nusing an out-of-sample extension algorithm.

The meson-baryon amplitudes T_{M'B',MB}(W) are calculated from\nsolving a set of coupled-channels integral equations defined by an interaction\nHamiltonian consisting of (a) meson-exchange interactions v_{M'B',MB} derived\nfrom phenomenological Lagrangian, and (b) vertex interactions N* --> MB for\ndescribing the transition of a bare excited nucleon state N* to a channel MB.\nThe parameters of v_{M'B',MB} are mainly constrained by the fit to the data of\npi N --> pi N in the low energy region up to W =1.4 GeV. The bare masses of N*\nand the N* --> MB parameters are then determined in simultaneous fits to the\ndata of pi N --> pi N up to W =2.3 GeV and those of pi N --> eta N, K Lambda, K\nSigma and gamma N --> pi N, eta N, K Lambda, K Sigma up to W = 2.1 GeV.

However, fitting mvLMMs is computationally\nnon-trivial, and no existing method is computationally practical for performing\nthe likelihood ratio test (LRT) for mvLMMs in GWAS settings with moderate\nsample size n. The existing software MTMM perform an approximate LRT for two\nphenotypes, and as we find, its p values can substantially understate the\nsignificance of associations. Here, we present novel computationally-efficient\nalgorithms for fitting mvLMMs, and computing the LRT in GWAS settings. After a\nsingle initial eigen-decomposition (with complexity O(n^3)) the algorithms i)\nreduce computational complexity (per iteration of the optimizer) from cubic to\nlinear in n; and ii) in GWAS analyses, reduces per-marker complexity from cubic\nto quadratic in n. These innovations make it practical to compute the LRT for\nmvLMMs in GWASs for tens of thousands of samples and a moderate number of\nphenotypes (~2-10). With simulations, we show that the LRT provides correct\ncontrol for type I error. With both simulations and real data we find that the\nLRT is more powerful than the approximate LRT from MTMM, and illustrate the\nbenefits of analyzing more than two phenotypes.
