Evidence to the contrary may necessitate an\nadditional pre-galactic production source or a revision of the standard model\nof Big Bang nucleosynthesis. We revisit the isotopic analysis of four halo\nstars, two with claimed 6Li-detections in the literature, to investigate the\ninfluence of improved model atmospheres and line formation treatment. For the\nfirst time, a combined 3D, NLTE (non-local thermodynamic equilibrium) modelling\ntechnique for Li, Na, and Ca lines is utilised to constrain the intrinsic\nline-broadening and to determine the Li isotopic ratio. We discuss the\ninfluence of 3D NLTE effects on line profile shapes and assess the realism of\nour modelling using the Ca excitation and ionisation balance. By accounting for\nNLTE line formation in realistic 3D hydrodynamical model atmospheres, we can\nmodel the Li resonance line and other neutral lines with a consistency that is\nsuperior to LTE, with no need for additional line asymmetry caused by the\npresence of 6Li. Contrary to the results from 1D and 3D LTE modelling, no star\nin our sample has a significant 2-sigma detection of the lighter isotope in\nNLTE. Over a large parameter space, NLTE modelling systematically reduces the\nbest-fit Li isotopic ratios by up to five percentage points. As a bi-product,\nwe also present the first ever 3D NLTE Ca and Na abundances of halo stars,\nwhich reveal significant departures from LTE.

This is done a postulate defining probabilities for\npaths, which we propose are determined by an expression involving path\namplitudes and a distance function that quantifies path separation. We suggest\na possible form for a path probability postulate and explore possible choices\nof distance function, including choices suitable for Lorentz or generally\ncovariant versions of real path quantum theory. We set out toy models of\nquantum interferometry and show that in these models the probability postulate\nand specific distance functions do indeed give a physically sensible path\nontology. These functions can be chosen so as to predict quantum interference\nfor interference of microscopic quantum systems and the failure of interference\nfor macroscopic quantum systems. More generally, they predict interference when\nthe beams are close, and its failure when they are far apart, as determined by\nthe distance function. If taken seriously in its present relatively\nunconstrained form, real path quantum theory thus motivates experimental tests\nof quantum interference in all unexplored regimes defined by potentially\nphysically interesting parameters, including the mass of the beam object, the\nbeam separation distance, the beam separation time, and many others.

In particular, laser-driven atomic\nmagnetometers have found a wide range of practical applications. More recently,\nso-called magnetically silent variants of atomic magnetometers have been\ndeveloped. While in conventional magnetometers the magnetic resonance\ntransitions between atomic sublevels are phase-coherently driven by a weak\noscillating magnetic field, silent magnetometers use schemes in which either\nthe frequency (FM) or the amplitude (AM) of the light beam is modulated. Here\nwe present a theoretical model that yields algebraic expressions for the\nparameters of the multiple resonances that occur when either amplitude-,\nfrequency- or polarization-modulated light of circular polarization is used to\ndrive the magnetic resonance transition in a transverse magnetic field.

The independent log(g) value from\nasteroseismology can be used as a fixed value in the spectroscopic analysis to\nreduce uncertainties due to the fact that log(g) and effective temperature can\nnot be determined independently from spectra. Since 2012, a combined analysis\nof seismically and spectroscopically derived stellar properties is ongoing for\na large survey with SDSS/APOGEE and Kepler. Therefore, knowledge of any\npotential biases and uncertainties in asteroseismic log(g) values is now\nbecoming important. Aims: The seismic parameter needed to derive log(g) is the\nfrequency of maximum oscillation power (nu_max). Here, we investigate the\ninfluence of nu_max derived with different methods on the derived log(g)\nvalues. The large frequency separation between modes of the same degree and\nconsecutive radial orders (Dnu) is often used as an additional constraint for\nthe determination of log(g). Additionally, we checked the influence of small\ncorrections applied to Dnu on the derived values of log(g). Methods We use\nmethods extensively described in the literature to determine nu_max and Dnu\ntogether with seismic scaling relations and grid-based modeling to derive\nlog(g). Results: We find that different approaches to derive oscillation\nparameters give results for log(g) with small, but different, biases for\nred-clump and red-giant-branch stars. These biases are well within the quoted\nuncertainties of ~0.01 dex (cgs). Corrections suggested in the literature to\nthe Dnu scaling relation have no significant effect on log(g). However somewhat\nunexpectedly, method specific solar reference values induce biases of the order\nof the uncertainties, which is not the case when canonical solar reference\nvalues are used.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 May 2013 19:00:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

Here, we\nconsider in detail the OAM-induced effects by such electrons in two forms of\npolarization radiation, namely in Cherenkov radiation and transition radiation.\nThanks to the large \\ell, we can neglect quantum or spin-induced effects, which\nare of the order of \\hbar \\omega/E_e \\ll 1, but retain the magnetic moment\ncontribution \\ell \\hbar \\omega/E_e \\lesssim 1, which makes the quasiclassical\napproach to polarization radiation applicable. We discuss the magnetic moment\ncontribution to polarization radiation, which has never been experimentally\nobserved, and study how its visibility depends on the kinematical parameters\nand the medium permittivity. In particular, it is shown that this contribution\ncan, in principle, be detected in azimuthally non-symmetrical problems, for\nexample when vortex electrons obliquely cross a metallic screen (transition\nradiation) or move nearby it (diffraction radiation). We predict a left-right\nangular asymmetry of the transition radiation (in the plane where the charge\nradiation distributions would stay symmetric), which appears due to an\neffective interference between the charge radiation field and the magnetic\nmoment one. Numerical values of this asymmetry for vortex electrons with E_e =\n300keV and \\ell = O(100-1000) are O(0.1-1%), and we argue that this effect\ncould be detected with existing technology.

Despite their comparatively extreme radio properties relative to\nmost BAL quasars, their optical properties are quite consistent with those of\nradio-quiet BAL quasars and dissimilar to those of radio-loud non-BAL quasars.\nWhile BAL quasars generally appear to have low values of [OIII]/FeII, an\nextreme of \"Eigenvector 1\", the Balmer line widths and Eddington ratios do not\nappear to significantly differ from those of unabsorbed quasars at similar\nredshifts and luminosities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 May 2013 19:54:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 29 May 2013 04:30:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

The method relies on the construction of a canonical transformation\nthat removes the explicit time-dependence from the Hamiltonian of the system.\nBy referring the phase-space locations of particles to a coordinate frame in\nwhich the potential remains `static' the dynamical effects introduced by the\ntime evolution vanish. It follows that dynamical invariants correspond to the\nintegrals of motion for the static potential expressed in the transformed\ncoordinates. The main difficulty of the method reduces to solving the\ndifferential equations that define the canonical transformation, which are\ntypically coupled with the equations of motion. We discuss a few examples where\nboth sets of equations can be exactly de-coupled, and cases that require\napproximations. The construction of dynamical invariants has far-reaching\napplications. These quantities allow us, for example, to describe the evolution\nof (statistical) microcanonical ensembles in time-dependent gravitational\npotentials without relying on ergodicity or probability assumptions. As an\nillustration, we follow the evolution of dynamical fossils in galaxies that\nbuild up mass hierarchically. It is shown that the growth of the host potential\ntends to efface tidal substructures in the integral-of-motion space through an\norbital diffusion process. The inexorable cycle of deposition, and progressive\ndissolution, of tidal clumps naturally leads to the formation of a `smooth'\nstellar halo.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 May 2013 20:00:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

Such an offset, as well as the width of\n~120kms-1, could be consistent with either a nuclear maser arising from an\naccretion disk of the central supermassive black hole, or for a jet maser that\nis emitted from the material that is shocked near the base of the jet in\nCentaurus\\,A.

The high quality of the gathered\ndata provides us with an unique opportunity to determine the surface and\ninternal properties of one of the most important and intriguing main belt\nasteroids (MBAs). In this paper, we focus on the size frequency distributions\n(SFDs) of sub-kilometer impact craters observed at high spatial resolution on\nseveral selected young terrains on Vesta. These small crater populations offer\nan excellent opportunity to determine the nature of their asteroidal precursors\n(namely MBAs) at sizes that are not directly observable from ground-based\ntelescopes (i.e., below ~100 m diameter). Moreover, unlike many other MBA\nsurfaces observed by spacecraft thus far, the young terrains examined had\ncrater spatial densities that were far from empirical saturation. Overall, we\nfind that the cumulative power-law index (slope) of small crater SFDs on Vesta\nis fairly consistent with predictions derived from current collisional and\ndynamical models down to a projectile size of ~10 m diameter (Bottke et al.,\n2005a,b). The shape of the impactor SFD for small projectile sizes does not\nappear to have changed over the last several billions of years, and an argument\ncan be made that the absolute number of small MBAs has remained roughly\nconstant (within a factor of 2) over the same time period. The apparent steady\nstate nature of the main belt population potentially provides us with a set of\nintriguing constraints that can be used to glean insights into the physical\nevolution of individual MBAs as well as the main belt as an ensemble.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 May 2013 02:50:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

This criterion is proved rigorously in some situations,\ngeneralizing well known results for the scalar equation where the pattern\nselection process can be understood in terms of a potential. In more complex\nsettings it is investigated numerically. Our criterion can be applied to\nefficiently design Biotechnology and Developmental Biology experiments, or\nsimplify the analysis of hypothesized morphogenetic models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 May 2013 05:50:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-29"}

The degree of expansion and mass loss depends largely on the\nstar formation efficiency and scales with the mass and size of the stellar\ngroup as long as stellar interactions can be neglected. We investigate under\nwhich circumstances stellar interactions between cluster members become so\nimportant that the fraction of bound stars after gas expulsion is significantly\naltered. The Nbody6 code is used to simulate the cluster dynamics after gas\nexpulsion for different SFEs. Concentrating on the most massive clusters\nobserved in the Milky Way, we test to what extend the results depend on the\nmodel, i.e. stellar mass distribution, stellar density profile etc., and the\ncluster parameters, such as cluster density and size.We find that stellar\ninteractions are responsible for up to 20% mass loss in the most compact\nmassive clusters in the Milky Way, making ejections the prime mass loss process\nin such systems. Even in the loosely bound OB associations stellar interactions\nare responsible for at least ~5% mass loss. The main reason why the importance\nof encounters for massive clusters has been largely overlooked is the often\nused approach of a single-mass representation instead of a realistic\ndistribution for the stellar masses. The density-dependence of the\nencounter-induced mass loss is shallower than expected because of the\nincreasing importance of few-body interactions in dense clusters compared to\nsparse clusters where 2-body encounters dominate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 May 2013 05:52:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

The\npotential to identify early warning signals that would allow researchers and\nmanagers to predict such events before they happen has therefore been an\ninvaluable discovery that offers a way forward in spite of such seemingly\nunpredictable behavior. Research into early warning signals has demonstrated\nthat it is possible to define and detect such early warning signals in advance\nof a transition in certain contexts. Here we describe the pattern emerging as\nresearch continues to explore just how far we can generalize these results. A\ncore of examples emerges that shares three properties: the phenomenon of rapid\nregime shifts, a pattern of 'critical slowing down' that can be used to detect\nthe approaching shift, and a mechanism of bifurcation driving the sudden\nchange. As research has expanded beyond these core examples, it is becoming\nclear that not all systems that show regime shifts exhibit critical slowing\ndown, or vice versa. Even when systems exhibit critical slowing down,\nstatistical detection is a challenge. We review the literature that explores\nthese edge cases and highlight the need for (a) new early warning behaviors\nthat can be used in cases where rapid shifts do not exhibit critical slowing\ndown, (b) the development of methods to identify which behavior might be an\nappropriate signal when encountering a novel system; bearing in mind that a\npositive indication for some systems is a negative indication in others, and\n(c) statistical methods that can distinguish between signatures of early\nwarning behaviors and noise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 May 2013 06:00:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-30"}

On the other\nhand, providing incentives for microtask crowdsourcing is challenging since\nverifying the quality of submitted solutions is so expensive that will negate\nthe advantage of microtask crowdsourcing. We study cost-effective incentive\nmechanisms for microtask crowdsourcing in this paper. In particular, we\nconsider a model with strategic workers, where the primary objective of a\nworker is to maximize his own utility. Based on this model, we analyze two\nbasic mechanisms widely adopted in existing microtask crowdsourcing\napplications and show that, to obtain high quality solutions from workers,\ntheir costs are constrained by some lower bounds. We then propose a\ncost-effective mechanism that employs quality-aware worker training as a tool\nto stimulate workers to provide high quality solutions.

We show that the magnetization that originates from\nrotation or oscillations of antiferromagnetic vector can, via $sd$-exchange\ncoupling, polarize the current and give rise to adiabatic and nonadiabatic spin\ntorques. Due to the Lorentz-type dynamics of antiferromagnetic moments (unlike\nthe Galilenian-like dynamics in ferromagnets), the adiabatic spin torque\naffects the characteristic lengthscale of the moving texture. Nonadiabatic spin\ntorque contributes to the energy pumping and can induce the stable motion of\nantiferromagnetic texture, but, in contrast to ferromagnets, has pure dynamic\norigin. We also consider the current-induced phenomena in artificial\nantiferromagnets where the current maps the staggered magnetization of the\nstructure.

The\nmechanically stable range of fluorite structure of UO2, which dictates the\nmaximum possible pressure of relevant pseudo-phase transitions, gives rise to\ndefect formation energies that span a wide band and overlap with the existing\nexperimental estimates. We reveal that the knowledge about pseudo-phase\nboundaries can not only provide important information of energetics that is\nhelpful for reducing the scattering in current estimates, but also be valuable\nfor guiding theoretical assessments, even to validate or disprove a theory. In\norder to take defect interactions into account and to extrapolate the physical\nquantities at finite stoichiometry deviations to that near the stoichiometry,\nwe develop a general formalism to describe the thermodynamics of a defective\nsystem. We also show that it is possible to include interactions among defects\nin a simple expression of point defect model (PDM) by introducing an auxiliary\nconstant mean-field. This generalization of the simple PDM leads to great\nversatility that allows one to study nonlinear effects of stoichiometry\ndeviation on materials' behavior. It is a powerful tool to extract the defect\nenergetics from finite defect concentrations to the dilute limit.

The\nfirst is the direct Device-to-Device (D2D) communications, which enables direct\nlinks between the wireless devices that reutilize the cellular spectrum and\nradio interface. The second is that of Machine-Type Communications (MTC), where\nthe objective is to attach a large number of low-rate low-power devices, termed\nMachine-Type Devices (MTDs) to the cellular network. MTDs pose new challenges\nto the cellular network, one if which is that the low transmission power can\nlead to outage problems for the cell-edge devices. Another issue imminent to\nMTC is the \\emph{massive access} that can lead to overload of the radio\ninterface. In this paper we explore the opportunity opened by D2D links for\nsupporting MTDs, since it can be desirable to carry the MTC traffic not through\ndirect links to a Base Station, but through a nearby relay. MTC is modeled as a\nfixed-rate traffic with an outage requirement. We propose two network-assisted\nD2D schemes that enable the cooperation between MTDs and standard cellular\ndevices, thereby meeting the MTC outage requirements while maximizing the rate\nof the broadband services for the other devices.

The method is based on the boundary integral equation in the\nelectrostatic limit. Besides the nanoparticle polarizability and the far-field\nresponse, the near-field enhancement around nanoparticles can be also\nconveniently expressed as an eigenmode sum of resonant terms. Moreover, the\nspatial configuration of the near-field enhancement depends explicitly on the\neigenfunctions of both the BIE integral operator and of its adjoint. It is also\nestablished a direct physical meaning of the two types of eigenfunctions. While\nit is well known that the eigenfunctions of the BIE operator are electric\ncharge modes, it is less known and used that the eigenfunctions of the adjoint\nrepresent the electric potential generated by the charge modes.

For this purpose, we use accurate\nenergies and positron densities obtained from the many-body wavefunction of the\ncorresponding positronic systems. The introduced potentials describe the exact\ncorrelations for the calculated systems including the formation of a\npositronium atom. We show that the scattering lengths and the low-energy s-wave\nphase shifts from accurate many-body calculations are well accounted for by the\nintroduced potential. We also calculate self-consistent two-component\ndensity-functional theory positron potentials and densities for the bound\npositronic systems within the local density approximation. They are in a very\ngood agreement with the many-body results, provided that the\nfinite-positron-density electron-positron correlation potential is used, and\nthey can also describe systems comprising a positronium atom. We argue that the\nintroduced single-particle positron potentials defined for single molecules are\ntransferable to the condensed phase when the inter-molecular interactions are\nweak. When this condition is fulfilled, the total positron potential can be\nconstructed in a good approximation as the superposition of the molecular\npotentials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 May 2013 14:13:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 30 Aug 2013 11:30:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 6 Sep 2013 13:11:27 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 19 Nov 2013 23:08:24 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 8 Jan 2014 02:07:38 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Tue, 4 Mar 2014 08:54:15 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Fri, 7 Mar 2014 23:38:20 GMT"},{"version":"v8","created":"Sat, 10 May 2014 20:47:27 GMT"},{"version":"v9","created":"Tue, 13 May 2014 19:38:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-21"}

The payload was released very accurately in\nthe nominal orbit. The name LARES means LAser RElativity Satellite and\nsummarises the objective of the mission and some characteristics of the\nsatellite. It is, in fact, a mission designed to test Einstein's General\nRelativity Theory (specifically 'frame dragging' and Lense-Thirring effect).\nThe satellite is passive and covered with optical retroreflectors that send\nback laser pulses to the emitting ground station. This allows accurate\npositioning of the satellite, which is important for measuring the very small\ndeviations from Galilei-Newton's laws. In 2008, ASI selected the prime\nindustrial contractor for the LARES system with a heavy involvement of the\nuniversities in all phases of the programme, from the design to the\nconstruction and testing of the satellite and separation system. The data\nexploitation phase started immediately after the launch under a new contract\nbetween ASI and those universities.

The effect of an\nintervention introduced with a given sampling design is assessed by the change\nin the resulting equilibrium distribution or, in more detail, by the\ndistribution of sample paths resulting from the intervention strategy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 May 2013 20:01:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-05"}

We provide a Hamiltonian framework that\ngives the equation $\\dot q = \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial p}(q,p), \\quad \\dot p =\n- \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial q}(q,p) - \\frac{\\partial \\tilde L}{\\partial \\dot\nq}(q,\\dot q)$. The method is to embed $M$ into a larger framework where the\nmotion drives a wave equation on the negative half line, where the energy in\nthe wave represents heat being carried away from the motion. We obtain a\nversion of N\\\"other's Theorem that is valid for dissipative systems.

This is why we named them\n\"metric gauge theories\". In the case of the internal gauge fields, they are a\nconsequence of the deformed Minkowski space (DMS) possessing the structure of a\ngeneralized Lagrange space.
