These services vary tremendously in their scope; at one end there\nis simple proof-reading, and at the other extreme there is in-depth and\nextensive peer-reviewing, proposal preparation, statistical analyses,\nre-writing and co-writing. In this paper, the various types of service are\nreviewed, along with authorship guidelines, and the question is raised of\nwhether the high-end services surpass most guidelines' criteria for authorship.\nThree other factors are considered. First, the ease of collaboration possible\nin the internet era allows multiple iterations between authors and the editing\nservice, so essentially, papers can be co-written. Second, 'editing services'\noften offer subject-specific experts who comment not only on the language, but\ninterpret and improve scientific content. Third, the trend towards heavily\nmulti-authored papers implies that the threshold necessary to earn authorship\nis declining. The inevitable conclusion is that at some point the contributions\nby 'editing services' should be deemed sufficient to warrant authorship. Trying\nto enforce any guidelines would likely be futile, but nevertheless, it might be\ntime to revisit the ethics of using some of the high-end 'editing services'. In\nan increasingly international job market, recognizing this problem might prove\nprogressively more important in authorship disputes, the allocation of research\ngrants, and hiring decisions\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 May 2013 18:16:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-13"}

Taken\nin conjunction with detailed multi-band UV, optical, NIR, and X-ray\nobservations we find that the broad-band afterglow emission is composed of\ndistinct reverse shock and forward shock contributions. The reverse shock\nemission dominates in the radio/millimeter and at <0.1 days in the\nUV/optical/NIR, while the forward shock emission dominates in the X-rays and at\n>0.1 days in the UV/optical/NIR. We further find that the optical and X-ray\ndata require a Wind circumburst environment, pointing to a massive star\nprogenitor. Using the combined forward and reverse shock emission we find that\nthe parameters of the burst are an isotropic kinetic energy of E_Kiso~2e53 erg,\na mass loss rate of Mdot~3e-8 Msun/yr (for a wind velocity of 1,000 km/s), and\na Lorentz factor at the deceleration time of Gamma(200s)~130. Due to the low\ndensity and large isotropic energy, the absence of a jet break to ~15 days\nplaces only a weak constraint on the opening angle of theta_j>2.5 deg, and\ntherefore a total energy of E_gamma+E_K>1.2e51 erg, similar to other GRBs.

Modern cellular\narchitectures such as distributed antenna systems (DAS), however, promise to\nboost cell-edge SNR, creating the environment needed to realize practical IA\ngains. Existing IA solutions cannot be applied to DAS as they neglect the\nper-remote-radio power constraints imposed on distributed precoders. This paper\nconsiders two types of distributed antenna IA systems: ones with a limit on\nmaximum per-radio power, and ones with a strict equality constraint on\nper-radio power. The rate-loss incurred by a simple power back-off strategy,\nused in systems with maximum power constraints, is characterized analytically.\nIt is also shown that enforcing strict power constraints avoids such a\nrate-loss but negatively affects IA feasibility. For such systems, an IA\nalgorithm is proposed and feasibility conditions are derived based on the\nconcept of system properness.

This would provide us with a useful mean to diagnose\nthe history of evolution of each blue-supergiant. At a given effective\ntemperature, much more nonradial pulsations are excited in the model after the\nred-supergiant stage than in the model evolving towards the red-supergiant. The\nproperties of radial and nonradial pulsations in blue supergiants are\ndiscussed. Predicted periods are compared with period ranges observed in some\n\\alpha-Cygni variables in the Galaxy and NGC 300. We have found that blue\nsupergiant models after the red-supergiant stage roughly agree with observed\nperiod ranges in most cases. However, we are left with the puzzle that the\npredicted surface N/C and N/O ratios seem to be too high compared with those of\nDeneb and Rigel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 May 2013 05:38:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

In order to match the\nproperties of transition discs with the largest (~50 A.U. scale) holes, we\nplace such `planets' at large radii in massive discs and then follow the\nevolution of the tidally coupled disc-planet system, comparing the system's\nevolution in the plane of mm flux against hole radius with the properties of\nobserved transition discs. We find that, on account of the high disc masses in\nthese systems, all but the most massive `planets' (100 Jupiter masses) are\nconveyed to small radii by Type II migration without significant fading at\nmillimetre wavelengths. Such behaviour would contradict the observed lack of mm\nbright transition discs with small (<10 A.U.) holes. On the other hand, imaging\nsurveys clearly rule out the presence of such massive companions in transition\ndiscs. We conclude that this is a serious problem for models that seek to\nexplain transition discs in terms of planetary companions unless some mechanism\ncan be found to halt inward migration and/or suppress mm flux production. We\nsuggest that the dynamical effects of substantial accretion on to the\nplanet/through the gap may offer the best prospect for halting such migration\nbut that further long term simulations are required to clarify this issue.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 May 2013 09:13:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

A comprehensive\ntheory of these phenomena was developed in 2011: It was shown that all\nexperimentally observed dependencies can be naturally explained by the\ninfluence of the ponderomotive forces which arise in the near-contact regions\nof the two-dimensional electron gas under the action of microwaves. Now we show\nthat the same near-contact physical processes should lead to another nonlinear\nelectrodynamic phenomenon - the second-harmonic generation. We calculate the\nfrequency, magnetic field, mobility, and power dependencies of the\nsecond-harmonic intensity and show that it can be as large as ~ 0.5 mW/cm2\nunder realistic experimental conditions. A part of this paper is devoted to a\nfurther discussion of the MIRO/ZRS phenomena: we explain how the\nponderomotive-force theory explains different experimental details, including\nthose which were not known in 2011, and critically discuss alternative\ntheories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 May 2013 14:35:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 22 Aug 2013 20:53:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

To this end, a generalized logarithmic nonlinear\nSchr\\\"odinger equation is proposed to describe the time evolution of a quantum\ndissipative system under continuous measurement. Within the Bohmian mechanics\nframework, a solution to this equation reveals a novel result: it displays a\ntime constant which should represent the dividing line between the quantum and\nclassical trajectories. It is shown that continuous measurements and damping\nnot only disturb the particle but compel the system to converge in time to a\nNewtonian regime. While the width of the wave packet may reach a stationary\nregime, its quantum trajectories converge exponentially in time to classical\ntrajectories. In particular, it is shown that damping tends to suppress further\nquantum effects on a time scale shorter than the relaxation time of the system.\nIf the initial wave packet width is taken to be equal to 2.8 10^{-15} m (the\napproximate size of an electron), the Bohmian time constant is found to have an\nupper limit, i. e., ${\\tau_{B\\max}} = {10^{- 26}}s$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 May 2013 15:16:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Oct 2013 08:26:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

The mathematical expressions are verified through simulation.\nFurther, we present the polynomial fit for the PDFs, which can be used to\nsimplify the computation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 May 2013 18:26:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-05"}
