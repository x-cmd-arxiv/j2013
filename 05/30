Usually, simulators are\ndeveloped and used which tend to be restricted to a particular, small range of\napplications. This led to the design and implementation of a new simulator\nPARSPIN, the subject of this thesis. In medical applications, the Bloch\nequation is a well-suited mathematical model of the underlying physics with a\nwide scope. In this thesis, it is shown how analytical solutions of the Bloch\nequation can be found, which promise substantial execution time advantages over\nnumerical solution methods. From these analytical solutions of the Bloch\nequation, a new formalism for the description and the analysis of complex\nimaging experiments is derived, the K-t formalism. It is shown that modern\nimaging methods can be better explained by the K-t formalism than by observing\nand analysing the magnetization of each spin of a spin ensemble. Various\napproaches for a numerical simulation of Magnetic Resonance imaging are\ndiscussed. It is shown that a simulation tool based on the K-t formalism\npromises a substantial gain in execution time. Proper spatial discretization\naccording to the sampling theorem, a topic rarely discussed in literature, is\nuniversally derived from the K-t formalism in this thesis. A spin-based\nsimulator is an application with high demands to computing facilities even on\nmodern hardware. In this thesis, two approaches for a parallelized software\narchitecture are designed, analysed and evaluated with regard to a reduction of\nexecution time. A number of possible applications in research and education are\ndemonstrated.

The NCS scheme codes across file chunks in time, exploiting file\nstriping and file duplication.

Accordingly, it might be\nexpected that only global symmetries are fundamental symmetries of Nature,\nwhereas local symmetries and associated massless gauge fields could solely\nemerge due to spontaneous breaking of underlying spacetime symmetries involved,\nsuch as relativistic invariance and supersymmetry. We further argue that this\nbreaking, taken in the form of the nonlinear sigma-model type pattern for\nvector fields or superfields, puts essential restrictions on geometrical\ndegrees of freedom of a physical field system that makes it to adjust itself in\nsuch a way that its global internal symmetry G turns into the local symmetry\nG_{loc}. Remarkably, this emergence process may naturally be triggered by\nsupersymmetry, as is illustrated in detail by an example of a general\nsupersymmetric QED model which is then extended to the Standard Model and GUTs.\nThe requirement of vacuum stability in such class of models makes both Lorentz\ninvariance and supersymmetry to become spontaneously broken in the visible\nsector. As a consequence, massless photon and other gauge bosons appear as the\ncorresponding Goldstone and pseudo-Goldstone zero modes and special local\ninvariance is simultaneously generated.

Multiple band EUV observations by\nAIA further reveal very similar signatures.

We show that near-IR [Fe\nII] emitting gas must be self-shielded from Lyman continuum photons, regardless\nof its excitation mechanism (shocks, FUV radiation, or both). High densities\nare required for the survival of Fe+ amid the strong Lyman continuum from Tr14,\nraising estimates of the mass-loss rates by an order of magnitude.

All four of these HH jets are highly collimated, with\nopening angles of only a few degrees, similar to those observed in low-mass\nprotostars. We propose that these jets reflect essentially the same outflow\nphenomenon seen in wide-angle molecular outflows associated with IM and\nhigh-mass protostars, but that the collimated atomic jet core is irradiated and\nrendered observable in Carina's harsh radiative environment. In more quiescent\nenvironments, this atomic core remains invisible, and outflows traced by\nshock-excited molecules in the outflow cavity give the impression that these\noutflows have a wider opening angle.

Some of these challenges call for\nobject models that can locate a desired object and separate it from its\nsurrounding background, even when both share similar colors and textures. In\nthis work, we extend a fuzzy object model, named cloud system model (CSM), to\nhandle video segmentation, and evaluate it for body pose estimation of toddlers\nat risk of autism. CSM has been successfully used to model the parts of the\nbrain (cerebrum, left and right brain hemispheres, and cerebellum) in order to\nautomatically locate and separate them from each other, the connected brain\nstem, and the background in 3D MR-images. In our case, the objects are\narticulated parts (2D projections) of the human body, which can deform, cause\nself-occlusions, and move along the video. The proposed CSM extension handles\narticulation by connecting the individual clouds, body parts, of the system\nusing a 2D stickman model. The stickman representation naturally allows us to\nextract 2D body pose measures of arm asymmetry patterns during unsupported gait\nof toddlers, a possible behavioral marker of autism.

Furthermore, we find that even in cases where a\nnegative magnification bias reduces the observed number count of background\nsources, the lensing effect improves the sensitivity of the count to the\nintrinsic faint-magnitude cut-off of the Schechter luminosity function. In a\nfield centered on a strong lensing cluster, observations of z >= 6 and z >= 13\ngalaxies with JWST can be used to infer this cut-off magnitude for values as\nfaint as M_{max} ~ -14.4 and -16.1 mag (L_{min} ~ 2.5*10^{26} and 1.2*10^{27}\nerg s^{-1} Hz^{-1}) respectively, within the range bracketed by existing\ntheoretical models. Gravitational lensing may therefore offer an effective way\nof constraining the low-luminosity cut-off of high-redshift galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 May 2013 20:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 Aug 2013 20:09:16 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 25 Nov 2013 20:59:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

A substantial increase of the coupling strength\nbetween the spin and the lowest-frequency polar mode is observed for tensile\nstrains.

Semiadjunctions (essentially a\nformulation of a universal mapping property using hets) turn out to be the\nappropriate concept for applications in the life sciences. The semiadjunctions\ncharacterize three principal schemes with applications: 1. determination\nthrough a receiving universal (e.g., natural selection, perception, language\nacquisition, recursion, and language understanding); 2. determination through a\nsending universal (e.g., intentional action, DNA mechanism to build amino\nacids, hierarchy of regulatory genes to build organs, stem cells, and language\nproduction), and 3. two-way determination with one universal as both receiving\nand sending (e.g., perception/action and language understanding/production).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 May 2013 21:24:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-31"}

This has\ngenerated a significant interest in the deployment of incentive mechanisms to\nreduce peak-time congestion. Typically, the design of these mechanisms requires\ninformation about user demand and sensitivity to prices. Such information is\nnaturally imperfect. In this paper, we propose a \\emph{fixed-budget rebate\nmechanism} that gives each user a reward proportional to his percentage\ncontribution to the aggregate reduction in peak time demand. For comparison, we\nalso study a time-of-day pricing mechanism that gives each user a fixed reward\nper unit reduction of his peak-time demand. To evaluate the two mechanisms, we\nintroduce a game-theoretic model that captures the \\emph{public good} nature of\ndecongestion. For each mechanism, we demonstrate that the socially optimal\nlevel of decongestion is achievable for a specific choice of the mechanism's\nparameter. We then investigate how imperfect information about user demand\naffects the mechanisms' effectiveness. From our results, the fixed-budget\nrebate pricing is more robust when the users' sensitivity to congestion is\n\"sufficiently\" convex. This feature of the fixed-budget rebate mechanism is\nattractive for many situations of interest and is driven by its closed-loop\nproperty, i.e., the unit reward decreases as the peak-time demand decreases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 May 2013 22:54:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

When quantum information is\nencoded into a highly entangled ground state of this model and subjected to\nthermal errors, the errors remain easily correctable for a long time without\nany active intervention, because a macroscopic energy barrier keeps the errors\nwell localized. As a result, stored quantum information can be retrieved\nfaithfully for a memory time which grows exponentially with the square of the\ninverse temperature. In contrast, for previously known types of topological\nquantum storage in three or fewer spatial dimensions the memory time scales\nexponentially with the inverse temperature, rather than its square.\n  This spin model exhibits a previously unexpected topological quantum order,\nin which ground states are locally indistinguishable, pointlike excitations are\nimmobile, and the immobility is not affected by small perturbations of the\nHamiltonian. The degeneracy of the ground state, though also insensitive to\nperturbations, is a complicated number-theoretic function of the system size,\nand the system bifurcates into multiple noninteracting copies of itself under\nreal-space renormalization group transformations.

One of the benefits is collective memory. In\ngroups on the move, social interactions play a crucial role in the cohesion and\nthe ability to make consensus decisions. When migrating from spawning to\nfeeding areas fish schools need to retain a collective memory of the\ndestination site over thousand of kilometers and changes in group formation or\nindividual preference can produce sudden changes in migration pathways. We\npropose a modelling framework, based on stochastic adaptive networks, that can\nreproduce this collective behaviour. We assume that three factors control group\nformation and school migration behaviour: the intensity of social interaction,\nthe relative number of informed individuals and the preference that each\nindividual has for the particular migration area. We treat these factors\nindependently and relate the individuals' preferences to the experience and\nmemory for certain migration sites. We demonstrate that removal of knowledgable\nindividuals or alteration of individual preference can produce rapid changes in\ngroup formation and collective behavior.

An enhancement of lower hybrid/whistler activity has been often\nobserved by sounding rockets and satellites in the presence of density\ndepletions (striations) in the upper ionosphere. We address here the process of\nlinear mode conversion of lower hybrid to whistler waves, mediated by a density\nstriation, using a scalar-field formalism (in the limit of cold plasma linear\ntheory) which we solve numerically.

A\ndrawback with A/B testing is that it is poorly suited for experiments involving\nsocial interference, when the treatment of individuals spills over to\nneighboring individuals along an underlying social network. In this work, we\npropose a novel methodology using graph clustering to analyze average treatment\neffects under social interference. To begin, we characterize graph-theoretic\nconditions under which individuals can be considered to be `network exposed' to\nan experiment. We then show how graph cluster randomization admits an efficient\nexact algorithm to compute the probabilities for each vertex being network\nexposed under several of these exposure conditions. Using these probabilities\nas inverse weights, a Horvitz-Thompson estimator can then provide an effect\nestimate that is unbiased, provided that the exposure model has been properly\nspecified.\n  Given an estimator that is unbiased, we focus on minimizing the variance.\nFirst, we develop simple sufficient conditions for the variance of the\nestimator to be asymptotically small in n, the size of the graph. However, for\ngeneral randomization schemes, this variance can be lower bounded by an\nexponential function of the degrees of a graph. In contrast, we show that if a\ngraph satisfies a restricted-growth condition on the growth rate of\nneighborhoods, then there exists a natural clustering algorithm, based on\nvertex neighborhoods, for which the variance of the estimator can be upper\nbounded by a linear function of the degrees. Thus we show that proper cluster\nrandomization can lead to exponentially lower estimator variance when\nexperimentally measuring average treatment effects under interference.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 May 2013 00:04:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-31"}

Sheen and collaborators recently found that a surprisingly large\nportion (38%) of massive early-type galaxies in heavy clusters show strong\nmerger-related disturbed features. This contradicts the general understanding\nthat massive clusters are hostile environments for galaxy mergers. Considering\nthe significance of mergers in galaxy evolution, it is important to understand\nthis. Aims. We aim to present a theoretical foundation that explains galaxy\nmergers in massive clusters. Methods. We used the N-body simulation technique\nto perform a cosmological-volume simulation and derive dark-halo merger trees.\nThen, we used the semi-analytic modeling technique to populate each halo with\ngalaxies. We ran hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy mergers to estimate the\nlifetime of merger features for the imaging condition used by Sheen and\ncollaborators. We applied this merger feature lifetime to our semi-analytic\nmodels. Finally, we counted the massive early-type galaxies in heavy model\nclusters that would show strong merger features. Results. While there still are\nsubstantial uncertainties, our preliminary results are remarkably close to the\nobserved fraction of galaxies with merger features. Key ingredients for the\nsuccess are twofold: firstly, the subhalo motion in dark haloes has been\naccurately traced, and, second, the lifetime of merger features has been\nproperly estimated. As a result, merger features are expected to last very long\nin cluster environments. Many massive early-type galaxies in heavy clusters\ntherefore show merger features not because they experience mergers in the\ncurrent clusters in situ, but because they still carry their merger features\nfrom their previous halo environments. Conclusions. Investigating the merger\nrelics of cluster galaxies is potentially important, because it uniquely allows\nus to backtrack the halo merger history.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 May 2013 01:23:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

Suitable\ntime division multiple access (TDMA) schemes are employed for both intra-WBAN\nand inter-WBANs access protocols. To emulate actual conditions of WBAN use,\nextensive on-body and inter-body \"everyday\" channel measurements are employed.\nIn addition, a realistic inter-WBAN channel model is simulated to investigate\nthe effect of body shadowing and hub location on WBAN performance in enabling\ncoexistence. When compared with single-link communications, it is found that\nopportunistic relaying can provide significant improvement, in terms of\nsignal-to-interference+noise ratio (SINR), to outage probability and level\ncrossing rate (LCR) into outages. However, average outage duration (AOD) is not\naffected.

With the addition of 228 near-maximum spectra from the literature we\nstudy the diversity among SNe Ia in a quantitative manner.

We further study the correlations between spectroscopic and\nphotometric parameters such as light-curve decline rate and color. In agreement\nwith previous studies, we find that the pW of Si II absorption features are\nvery good indicators of light-curve decline rate.

In the first case, the Sommerfeld enhancement is sizable for\nlarge $I$, producing large $\\chi^0\\bar{\\chi^0}\\to VV$ rates. In particular, we\nobtain large $\\chi\\bar\\chi\\to W^+ W^-$ cross section, which is comparable to\nthe latest bounds from indirect searches and $m_\\chi$ is constrained to be\nlarger than few hundred GeV to few TeV. It is possible to give correct relic\ndensity with $m_\\chi$ higher than these lower bounds. In the second case, to\ncouple DM to standard model (SM) particles, a SM-singlet vector mediator $X$ is\nrequired from renormalizability and the SM gauge quantum numbers. To satisfy\nthe latest bounds of direct searches and to reproduce the DM relic density at\nthe same time, resonant enhancement in DM annihilation diagram is needed. Thus,\nthe masses of DM and the mediator are related. Furthermore, this model is not\nsufficient to explain the deviation in muon $g-2$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 May 2013 05:46:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Jun 2013 07:30:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 12 Aug 2013 06:02:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-28"}

Moreover, such\nquasi-periodic oscillation is not uniform and has multiple peaks, which\ndisplays random feature.

When a gravitating body is surrounded by a\nplasma, the lensing angle depends on a frequency of the electromagnetic wave\ndue to refraction properties, and the dispersion properties of the light\npropagation in gravitational field in plasma. The last effect leads to\ndifference, even in uniform plasma, of gravitational deflection angle in plasma\nfrom vacuum case. This angle depends on the photon frequency, what resembles\nthe properties of the refractive prism spectrometer. Here we consider the case\nof a strong deflection angle for the light, traveling near the Schwarzschild\nblack hole, surrounded by a uniform plasma.

We suggest here this expectation of a large extragalactic\nbackground, over and above that contributed by the sources observed in the\nsurveys, is based on an extremely simple geometry adopted to model the Galactic\nemission and the procedure adopted in the estimation of the extragalactic\ncontribution. In this paper, we derive the extragalactic radio background from\nwide-field radio images by using a more realistic modeling of the Galactic\nemission and decompose the sky maps at 150, 408, and 1420 MHz into anisotropic\nGalactic and isotropic extragalactic components. The anisotropic Galactic\ncomponent is assumed to arise from a highly flattened spheroid representing the\nthick disc, embedded in a spherical halo, both centered at the Galactic center,\nalong with Galactic sources, filamentary structures, Galactic loops and spurs.\nAll components are constrained to be positive and the optimization scheme\nminimizes the sky area occupied by the complex filaments. We show that in\ncontrast to the simple modeling of the Galactic emission as a plane parallel\nslab, the more realistic modeling yields estimates for the uniform\nextragalactic brightness that is consistent with expectations from known\nextragalactic radio source populations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 May 2013 10:59:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

The reddening corrected colour curves of SN 2011dh are\nfound to be redder than other well studied type IIb supernovae. The bolometric\nlight curve indicates $\\sim$ 0.09 M$_\\odot$ of $^{56}$Ni is synthesized during\nthe explosion. The HeI lines were detected in the spectra during the rise to\nmaximum. The nebular spectra of SN 2011dh show a box shaped emission in the red\nwing of the [OI] 6300-6363 \\AA\\ feature, that is attributed to H$\\alpha$\nemission from a shock excited circumstellar material. The analysis of nebular\nspectra indicates that $\\sim 0.2$ M$_\\odot$ of oxygen was ejected during the\nexplosion. Further, the [CaII]/[OI] line ratio in the nebular phase is $\\sim$\n0.7, indicating a progenitor with a main sequence mass of 10-15 M$_\\odot$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 May 2013 11:35:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

The waves are\ndecoupled and accumulate at predictable parts of the magnetic topology: fast\nwaves accumulate at the null point; whereas Alfv\\'en waves cannot cross the\nseparatricies. However, in nonlinear MHD mode conversion can occur at regions\nof inhomogeneous Alfv\\'en speed, suggesting that the decoupled nature of waves\nmay not extend to the nonlinear regime. Aims: We investigate the behaviour of\nlow-amplitude Alfv\\'en waves about a 2D magnetic null point in nonlinear,\n{\\beta}= 0 MHD. Methods: We numerically simulate the introduction of\nlow-amplitude Alfv\\'en waves into the vicinity of a magnetic null point using\nthe nonlinear LARE2D code. Results: Unlike in the linear regime, we find that\nthe Alfv\\'en wave sustains cospatial daughter disturbances, manifest in the\ntransverse and longitudinal fluid velocity, owing to the action of nonlinear\nmagnetic pressure gradients (viz. the ponderomotive force). These disturbances\nare dependent on the Alfv\\'en wave and do not interact with the medium to\nexcite magnetoacoustic waves, although the transverse daughter becomes focused\nat the null point. Additionally, an independently propagating fast\nmagnetoacoustic wave is generated during the early stages, which transports\nsome of the initial Alfv\\'en wave energy towards the null point. Subsequently,\ndespite undergoing dispersion and phase-mixing due to gradients in the\nAlfv\\'en-speed profile (Grad c_A \\neq 0) there is no further nonlinear\ngeneration of fast waves.

We focus on the mechanisms\nthat determine whether the flow is quasi-2D, 3D or in any intermediate state.\nTo this end, forcing is applied by injecting a DC current $I$ through one wall\nof the cube only, to drive vortices spinning along the magnetic field.\nDepending on the intensity of the externally applied magnetic field, these\nvortices extend part or all of the way through the cube. Driving the flow in\nthis way allows us to precisely control not only the forcing intensity but also\nits dimensionality. A comparison with the theoretical analysis of this\nconfiguration singles out the influences of the walls and of the forcing on the\nflow dimensionality, which is characterised in several ways. First, when\ninertia drives three-dimensionality, the velocity near the wall where current\nis injected scales as $U_b\\sim I^{2/3}$. Second, when the distance $l_z$ over\nwhich momentum diffuses under the action of the Lorentz force reaches the\nchannel width $h$, the velocity near the opposite wall $U_t$ follows a similar\nlaw with a correction factor $(1-h/l_z)$. When $l_z<h$, by contrast, the\nopposite wall has less influence on the flow and $U_t\\sim I^{1/2}$. The central\nrole played by the ratio $l_z/h$ is confirmed by experimentally verifying\nSommeria & Moreau (1982)'s scaling $l_z\\sim N^{1/2}$ ($N$ is the interaction\nparameter) and finally, the nature of the three-dimensionality is further\nclarified by distinguishing weak and strong three-dimensionalities. It is found\nthat both vanish only asymptotically in the limit $N\\rightarrow\\infty$.

The quantities\nconsidered in these tests are the critical coupling for the transition to the\nordered phase and the associated critical exponents nu and beta.

The results suggest\nthat cell growth is neither linear nor exponential, but subject to\nsize-dependent regulation. To explain their data, we build a model in which the\ncell growth rate is controlled by the relative amount of mRNA and ribosomes in\na cell. Plus a stochastic division rule, the evolutionary process of a\npopulation of cells can be simulated and the statistics of the in-silico\npopulation agree well with the experimental data.
