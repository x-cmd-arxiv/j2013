We give evidence, based on electrical resistivity measurements of\ndilute Y(Gd) and Y(Tb) alloys to 120 GPa, that the volume collapse transitions\nin Gd and Tb metals have different origins, despite their being neighbors in\nthe periodic table. Remarkably, the change under pressure in the magnetic state\nof isolated Pr or Tb impurity ions in the nonmagnetic Y host appears to closely\nmirror corresponding changes in pure Pr or Tb metals. The collapse in Tb\nappears to be driven by an enhanced negative exchange interaction between 4f\nand conduction electrons under pressure (Kondo resonance) which, in the case of\nY(Tb), dramatically alters the superconducting properties of the Y host, much\nlike previously found for Y(Pr). In Gd our resistivity measurements suggest\nthat a Kondo resonance is not the main driver for its volume collapse. X-ray\nabsorption and emission spectroscopies clearly show that 4f local moments\nremain largely intact across both volume collapse transitions ruling out 4f\nband formation (delocalization) and valence transition models as possible\ndrivers.

During the accretion stage, the system is\ncalled a low-mass X-ray binary, and bright X-ray emission is observed. When the\nrate of mass transfer decreases in the later evolutionary stages, these\nbinaries host a radio millisecond pulsar whose emission is powered by the\nneutron star's rotating magnetic field. This evolutionary model is supported by\nthe detection of millisecond X-ray pulsations from several accreting neutron\nstars and also by the evidence for a past accretion disc in a rotation-powered\nmillisecond pulsar. It has been proposed that a rotation-powered pulsar may\ntemporarily switch on during periods of low mass inflow in some such systems.\nOnly indirect evidence for this transition has hitherto been observed. Here we\nreport observations of accretion-powered, millisecond X-ray pulsations from a\nneutron star previously seen as a rotation-powered radio pulsar. Within a few\ndays after a month-long X-ray outburst, radio pulses were again detected.

Second, an explicit\nerror bound of the error introduced by digitizing a continuous line segment has\nbeen derived and used to propose a generic non-heuristic parameter independent\nframework which can be used in several dominant point detection methods. For\nthe problem of tangent estimation for digital curves, a simple method of\ntangent estimation has been proposed.

We\ncombined the publicly available Kepler photometry (quarters 1-13) with\nhigh-resolution spectroscopy from the Sandiford@McDonald and FIES@NOT\nspectrographs.

Although a rich theory has\narisen from this viewpoint, cf. [L1], idempotent semirings possess a restricted\nalgebraic structure theory, and also do not reflect certain valuation-theoretic\nproperties, thereby forcing researchers to rely often on combinatoric\ntechniques.\n  In this paper we describe an alternative structure, more compatible with\nvaluation theory, studied by the authors over the past few years, that permits\nfuller use of algebraic theory especially in understanding the underlying\ntropical geometry. The idempotent max-plus algebra $A$ of an ordered monoid\n$\\tM$ is replaced by $R: = L\\times \\tM$, where $L$ is a given indexing semiring\n(not necessarily with 0). In this case we say $R$ layered by $L$. When $L$ is\ntrivial, i.e, $L=\\{1\\}$, $R$ is the usual bipotent max-plus algebra. When\n$L=\\{1,\\infty\\}$ we recover the \"standard\" supertropical structure with its\n\"ghost\" layer. When $L = \\NN $ we can describe multiple roots of polynomials\nvia a \"layering function\" $s: R \\to L$. Likewise, one can define the layering\n$s: R^{(n)} \\to L^{(n)}$ componentwise; vectors $v_1, \\dots, v_m$ are called\ntropically dependent if each component of some nontrivial linear combination\n$\\sum \\a_i v_i$ is a ghost, for \"tangible\" $\\a_i \\in R$. Then an $n\\times n$\nmatrix has tropically dependent rows iff its permanent is a ghost.\n  We explain how supertropical algebras, and more generally layered algebras,\nprovide a robust algebraic foundation for tropical linear algebra, in which\nmany classical tools are available. In the process, we provide some new results\nconcerning the rank of d-independent sets (such as the fact that they are\nsemi-additive),put them in the context of supertropical bilinear forms, and lay\nthe matrix theory in the framework of identities of semirings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 May 2013 19:57:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-17"}

A similar study\nhas been reported for the self part, and we study the self and distinct parts\nseparately because their damping processes are not simply related. We begin\nwith the perfect vibrational system, which provides precise definitions of the\nliquid correlations, and provides the vibrational approximation Fdvib(q,t) at\nall q and t. Two independent liquid correlations are defined, motional and\nstructural, and these are decorrelated sequentially, with a crossover time\ntc(q). This is done by two independent decorrelation processes: the first,\nvibrational dephasing, is naturally present in Fdvib(q,t) and operates to damp\nthe motional correlation; the second, transit-induced decorrelation, is invoked\nto enhance the damping of motional correlation, and then to damp the structural\ncorrelation. A microscopic model is made for the \"transit drift\", the averaged\ntransit motion that damps motional correlation on 0 < t < tc(q). Following the\npreviously developed self-decorrelation theory, a microscopic model is also\nmade for the \"transit random walk,\" which damps the structural correlation on t\n> tc(q). The complete model incorporates a property common to both self and\ndistinct decorrelation: simple exponential decay following a delay period,\nwhere the delay is tc(q, the time required for the random walk to emerge from\nthe drift.

The rotation rate at the solar Equator seems to decrease since cycle\n10 onwards.

A new\nexplanation is proposed to address such a solar-cycle related variation of the\nsolar rotation rates. Weak magnetic fields may more effectively reflect\ndifferentiation at low latitudes with high rotation rates than at high\nlatitudes with low rotation rates, and strong magnetic fields may more\neffectively repress differentiation at relatively low latitudes than at high\nlatitudes.

It has advantages of being halo free, easy to implement,\nand low time and memory costs (comparable to those of the bilateral filter).\nThus, it is more generic than a smoothing operator and can better adapt to\ndifferent tasks.

Partial DNA unwrapping enables easier access of\nDNA-binding factors to their target sites and thus may provide a dominant\npathway for effecting rapid and robust access to DNA packaged into chromatin.\nIndeed, a recent high-resolution map of distances between neighboring\nnucleosome dyads in \\emph{S.cerevisiae} shows that at least 38.7\\% of all\nnucleosomes are partially unwrapped. The extent of unwrapping follows a\nstereotypical pattern in the vicinity of genes, reminiscent of the canonical\npattern of nucleosome occupancy in which nucleosomes are depleted over\npromoters and well-positioned over coding regions. To explain these\nobservations, we developed a biophysical model which employs a 10-11 base pair\nperiodic nucleosome energy profile. The profile, based on the pattern of\nhistone-DNA contacts in nucleosome crystal structures and the idea of linker\nlength discretization, accounts for both nucleosome unwrapping and higher-order\nchromatin structure. Our model reproduces the observed genome-wide distribution\nof inter-dyad distances, and accounts for patterns of nucleosome occupancy and\nunwrapping around coding regions. At the same time, our approach explains\n\\emph{in vitro} measurements of accessibility of nucleosome-covered binding\nsites, and of nucleosome-induced cooperativity between DNA-binding factors.

The comparison between two average SEDs\n(sources with and without individual Herschel detections) matched in the\nUV/optical indicates that for these objects the strength of the MIR emission\nmay correlate with the strength of the FIR emission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 May 2013 07:14:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

The next challenge consists of\nunderstanding the molecular basis of these associations. The integration of\nmultiple association datasets, including gene expression datasets, can\ncontribute to this goal. We have developed a novel statistical methodology to\nassess whether two association signals are consistent with a shared causal\nvariant. An application is the integration of disease scans with expression\nquantitative trait locus (eQTL) studies, but any pair of GWAS datasets can be\nintegrated in this framework.

The guardians are deployed alongside a\nsensor network, inspecting all local traffic, classifying packets based on\ntheir content, and destroying any malicious packet while still on the air. In\nthat sense, the system tries to gain \"air dominance\" over attackers. A key\nchallenge in implementing the guardian system is the resulting real-time\nrequirement in order to classify and destroy packets during transmission. We\npresent a USRP2 software radio based guardian implementation for IEEE 802.15.4\nthat meets this challenge; using an FPGA-based design we can even check for the\ncontent of the very last payload byte of a packet and still prevent its\nreception by a potential victim mote. Our evaluation shows that the guardians\neffectively block 99.9% of unauthorized traffic in 802.15.4 networks in our\nexperiments, without disturbing the legitimate operations of the WSN.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 May 2013 10:15:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-20"}

The main aim of this\nstudy is to constrain the global shape of the flux rope axis from local\nmeasurements, and to compare the results from in-situ data with imager\nobservations. We perform a statistical analysis of the set of MCs observed by\nWIND spacecraft over 15 years in the vicinity of Earth. With the hypothesis of\nhaving a sample of MCs with a uniform distribution of spacecraft crossing along\ntheir axis, we show that a mean axis shape can be derived from the distribution\nof the axis orientation. In complement, while heliospheric imagers do not\ntypically observe MCs but only their sheath region, we analyze one event where\nthe flux-rope axis can be estimated from the STEREO imagers. From the analysis\nof a set of theoretical models, we show that the distribution of the local axis\norientation is strongly affected by the global axis shape. Next, we derive the\nmean axis shape from the integration of the observed orientation distribution.\nThis shape is robust as it is mostly determined from the global shape of the\ndistribution. Moreover, we find no dependence on the flux-rope inclination on\nthe ecliptic. Finally, the derived shape is fully consistent with the one\nderived from heliospheric imager observations of the June 2008 event. We have\nderived a mean shape of MC axis which only depends on one free parameter, the\nangular separation of the legs (as viewed from the Sun). This mean shape can be\nused in various contexts such as the study of high energy particles or space\nweather forecast.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 May 2013 10:16:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

Extensions to the 2D model\nrequire the physical understanding of 3D reconnection processes at the origin\nof the magnetic configuration evolution. However, the properties of 3D\nreconnection without null point and separatrices still need to be analyzed. We\nfocus on magnetic reconnection associated with the growth and evolution of a\nflux rope and associated flare loops during an eruptive flare. We aim at\nunderstanding the intrinsic characteristics of 3D reconnection in the presence\nof quasi-separatrix layers (QSLs), how QSL properties are related to the\nslip-running reconnection mode in general, and how this applies to eruptive\nflares in particular. We studied the slip-running reconnection of field lines\nin a magnetohydrodynamic simulation of an eruptive flare associated with a\ntorus-unstable flux rope. Field lines associated with the flux rope and the\nflare loops undergo a continuous series of magnetic reconnection, which results\nin their super-Alfvenic slipping motion. The time profile of their slippage\nspeed and the space distribution of the mapping norm are shown to be strongly\ncorrelated. We find that the motion speed is proportional to the mapping norm.\nMoreover, this slip-running motion becomes faster as the flux rope expands,\nsince the 3D current layer evolves toward a current sheet, and QSLs to\nseparatrices. The present analysis extends our understanding of the 3D\nslip-running reconnection regime.

It will be explained why, besides the \"homo economicus\"\nwith strictly self-regarding preferences, natural selection has also created a\n\"homo socialis\" with other-regarding preferences. While the \"homo economicus\"\noptimizes the own prospects in separation, the decisions of the \"homo socialis\"\nare self-determined, but interconnected, a fact that may be characterized by\nthe term \"networked minds\". Notably, the \"homo socialis\" manages to earn higher\npayoffs than the \"homo economicus\".\n  I show that the \"homo economicus\" and the \"homo socialis\" imply a different\nkind of dynamics and distinct aggregate outcomes. Therefore, next to the\ntraditional economics for the \"homo economicus\" (\"economics 1.0\"), a\ncomplementary theory must be developed for the \"homo socialis\". This economic\ntheory might be called \"economics 2.0\" or \"socionomics\". The names are\njustified, because the Web 2.0 is currently promoting a transition to a new\nmarket organization, which benefits from social media platforms and could be\ncharacterized as \"participatory market society\". To thrive, the \"homo socialis\"\nrequires suitable institutional settings such a particular kinds of reputation\nsystems, which will be sketched in this paper.

Enthalpy\nfluctuations of an arbitrarily chosen subsystem must be buffered by the\nremainder of the total system which serves as a heat reservoir. The magnitude\nof these fluctuations depends on the size of the reservoir. This leads to\nvarious interesting consequences for the physical behavior of the subsystem. As\nan example, we treat a lipid membrane with a phase transition that is embedded\nin an aqueous reservoir. We find that large fluctuations are attenuated when\nthe reservoir has finite size. This has consequences for the compressibility of\nthe membrane since volume and area fluctuations are also attenuated. We compare\nthe equilibrium fluctuations of subsystems in finite reservoirs with those in\nperiodically driven systems. In such systems, the subsystem has only finite\ntime available to exchange heat with the surrounding medium. A larger frequency\ntherefore reduces the volume of the accessible heat reservoir. Consequently,\nthe fluctuations of the subsystem display a frequency dependence.

Assuming\na binned extended source analysis method, we find that the only possible\nevidence for neutrino emission for sources located in the Northern hemisphere\nis from the Cygnus region after 20 years of exposure. For other parts of the\nGalactic Plane even a 20 years exposure with IceCube is not sufficient for the\ndetection. Taking into account marginal significance of the detectable source\nin the Cygnus region, we find a precise position and size of the source region\nwhich optimizes the signal-to-noise ratio for neutrinos. We also calculate the\nlow-energy threshold above which the neutrino signal could be detected with the\nhighest signal-to-noise ratio. This calculation of precise source position,\nsize and energy range, based on the gamma-ray data, could be used to remove the\n'trial factor' in the analysis of the real neutrino data of IceCube. We notice\nthat the diffuse neutrino emission from the inner Galactic Plane in the\nSouthern Hemisphere is much brighter. A neutrino detector with characteristics\nequivalent to IceCube, but placed at the Northern Hemisphere (such as KM3NeT),\nwould detect several isolated neutrino sources in the Galactic Plane within\njust 5 years exposure at 5{\\sigma} level. These isolated sources of ~TeV\nneutrinos would unambiguously localize sources of cosmic rays which operated\nover the last 10 thousand years in the Galaxy.[abridged]\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 May 2013 15:33:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

Fundamental to this problem is the\ncompetition between antiferromagnetic spin correlations, a symptom of strong\nCoulomb interactions, and the kinetic energy of the doped carriers, which\nfavors delocalization. After discussing some of the early challenges in the\nfield, I describe the experimental picture provided by a variety of\nspectroscopic and transport techniques. Then I turn to the technique of neutron\nscattering, and discuss how it is used to determine spin correlations,\nespecially in model systems of quantum magnetism. Neutron scattering and\ncomplementary techniques have determined the extent to which antiferromagnetic\nspin correlations survive in the cuprate superconductors. One experimental case\ninvolves the ordering of spin and charge stripes. I first consider related\nmeasurements on model compounds, such as La(2-x)Sr(x)NiO(4+d), and then discuss\nthe case of La(2-x)Ba(x)CuO(4). In the latter system, recent transport studies\nhave demonstrated that quasi-two-dimensional superconductivity coexists with\nthe stripe order, but with frustrated phase order between the layers. This has\nled to new concepts for the coexistence of spin order and superconductivity.\nWhile the relevance of stripe correlations to high-temperature\nsuperconductivity remains a subject of controversy, there is no question that\nstripes are an intriguing example of electron matter that results from strong\ncorrelations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 May 2013 15:52:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-19"}

The coefficient $B$ in the standard form of differential rotation,\nwhich represents the latitudinal gradient of rotation, may be divided into\nthree parts within a Schwabe cycle.
