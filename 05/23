Several common\nradioisotopes in detector construction materials are found in long decay\nchains, notably those headed by 238U, 235U, and 232Th. Gamma radioassay using\nGe detectors identifies decay rates of a few of the radioisotopes in each\nchain, and typically assumes that the chain is in secular equilibrium. If the\nchains are out of equilibrium, detector background rates can be elevated\nsignificantly above expectation. In this work we quantify the increase in\nneutron and gamma production rates from an excess of various sub-chains of the\n238U decay chain. We find that the 226Ra sub-chain generates x10 higher neutron\nflux per decay than the 238U early sub-chain and 210Pb sub-chain, in materials\nwith high (alpha,n) neutron yields. Typical gamma screening results limit\npotential 238U early sub-chain activity to x20-60 higher than 226Ra sub-chain\nactivity. Monte Carlo simulation is used to quantify the contribution of the\nsub-chains of 238U to low-energy nuclear recoil (NR) and electron recoil (ER)\nbackgrounds in simplified one tonne liquid Ar and liquid Xe detectors. NR and\nER rates generated by 238U sub-chains in the Ar and Xe detectors are found\nafter comparable fiducial and multiple-scatter cuts. The Xe detector is found\nto have x12 higher signal-to-background for 100 GeV WIMPs over neutrons than\nthe Ar detector. ER backgrounds in both detectors are found to increase weakly\nfor excesses of 238U early sub-chain and 210Pb sub-chain relative to 226Ra\nsub-chain. Experiments in which backgrounds are NR-dominated are sensitive to\nundetected excesses of 238U early sub-chain and 210Pb sub-chain concentrations.\nExperiments with ER-dominated backgrounds are relatively insensitive to these\nexcesses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 May 2013 16:27:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-23"}

However, approximate functionals are\nnot normally expressed in terms of the fractional variables. Here we develop a\ngeneral framework for extending approximate density functionals and\nmany-electron theory to fractional-charge and fractional-spin systems. Our\ndevelopment allows for the fractional extension of any approximate theory that\nis a functional of $G^{0}$, the one-electron Green's function of the\nnon-interacting reference system. The extension to fractional charge and\nfractional spin systems is based on the ensemble average of the basic variable,\n$G^{0}$. We demonstrate the fractional extension for the following theories:\n(1) any explicit functional of the one-electron density, such as the LDA and\nGGA; (2) any explicit functional of the one-electron density matrix of the\nnon-interacting reference system, such as the exact exchange functional and\nhybrid functionals; (3) many-body perturbation theory; and (4) random-phase\napproximations. A general rule for such an extension has also been derived\nthrough scaling the orbitals and should be useful for functionals where the\nlink to the Green's function is not obvious. The development thus enables the\nexamination of approximate theories against known exact conditions on the\nfractional variables and the analysis of their failures in chemical and\nphysical applications in terms of violations of exact conditions of the energy\nfunctionals.

These differences can best be explained\nif the onset of high eccentricity planet migration is also a time when planet\nare sent into merge with the star. Planet migration into the star is likely a\ncomplementary explanation to the view that systems with higher initial iron\nabundance form more planets, and that more crowded planets are more likely to\nscatter into eccentric orbits. Planets of iron-rich single stars have\neccentricity distributions that are higher than planets of iron-poor single\nstars (where \"rich\" and \"poor\" are stars whose [Fe/H] is above and below solar,\nrespectively). Stars with planets that have a stellar companion comprise a\nthird population of systems in which the stars are preferentially iron-rich. We\ndescribe new patterns that are best explained by eccentric planet migration\nbeing associated with other planets migrating into the star. Though medium\nplanets are more numerous than giant planets at periods greater than three\ndays, giant planets are more numerous than medium planets at the shortest\nperiods.

If the bullet path is the same,\nlarger retarding forces produce larger wounding effects and a greater\nprobability of rapid incapacitation. By Newton's third law, the force of the\nbullet on the tissue is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the\nforce of the tissue on the bullet. For bullets penetrating with constant mass,\nthe retarding force on the bullet can be determined by frame by frame analysis\nof high speed video of the bullet penetrating a suitable tissue simulant such\nas calibrated 10% ballistic gelatin.

A key property of video\non-demand is the asynchronous content reuse, such that a few dominant videos\naccount for a large part of the traffic, but are viewed by users at different\ntimes. Caching of content on devices in conjunction with D2D communications\nallows to exploit this property, and provide a network throughput that is\nsignificantly in excess of both the conventional approach of unicasting from\nthe base station and the traditional D2D networks for regular data traffic.\nThis paper presents in a semi-tutorial concise form some recent results on the\nthroughput scaling laws of wireless networks with caching and asynchronous\ncontent reuse, contrasting the D2D approach with a competing approach based on\ncombinatorial cache design and network coded transmission from the base station\n(BS) only, referred to as coded multicasting. Interestingly, the spatial reuse\ngain of the former and the coded multicasting gain of the latter yield, somehow\nsurprisingly, the same near-optimal throughput behavior in the relevant regime\nwhere the number of video files in the library is smaller than the number of\nstreaming users.

When the quantum matter field is projected to a one-particle\nstate, the master equation for a non-relativistic quantum particle in a weak\ngravitational field predicts decoherence in the energy basis, in contrast to\nmost existing theories of gravitational decoherence.

This is similar to\nthe dependence of the decoherence rate of a quantum Brownian particle to the\ntemperature and spectral density of the environment it interacts with. The\ncorresponding features when gravity acts as an environment in decohering\nquantum objects are what we call the `textures' of spacetime.

This is likely caused by an increasing\nneutral fraction in the IGM that substantially attenuates Lyman-alpha emission\nat z ~ 7.7.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 May 2013 20:00:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

To resolve this\nquestion, we have obtained near-infrared (NIR), mid-infrared (MIR) and radio\nobservations of the compact H ii region IRAS 12063-6259. We use these data to\nconstruct multiple independent extinction maps and also to measure the main PAH\nfeatures (6.2, 7.7, 8.6 and 11.2 {\\mu}m) in the MIR. Three extinction maps are\nderived: the first using the NIR hydrogen lines and case B recombination\ntheory; the second combining the NIR data with radio data; and the third making\nuse of the Spitzer/IRS MIR observations to measure the 9.8 {\\mu}m silicate\nabsorption feature using the Spoon method and PAHFIT (as the depth of this\nfeature can be related to overall extinction). The silicate absorption over the\nbright, southern component of IRAS 12063-6259 is almost absent while the other\nmethods find significant extinction. While such breakdowns of the relationship\nbetween the NIR extinction and the 9.8 {\\mu}m absorption have been observed in\nmolecular clouds, they have never been observed for HII regions. We then\ncompare the PAH intensity variations in the Spitzer/IRS data after dereddening\nto those found in the original data. It was found that in most cases, the PAH\nband intensity variations persist even after dereddening, implying that\nextinction is not the main cause of the PAH band intensity variations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 May 2013 20:01:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

The resulting census eliminates a longstanding bias against disks with\nlate-type hosts, and thereby reveals a strong correlation between L_mm and the\nhost spectral type.

In a barred galaxy, the increase results from a combination of\nthree separate factors (a) orientation and inclination effects; (b) angular\nmomentum transport by the bar that results in an increase in the central mass\ndensity; (c) an increase in the vertical and radial velocity anisotropy of\nstars in the vicinity of the SMBH.

The increase in $\\sigma$ following\nthe growth of the SMBH is insensitive to a variation of a factor of 10 in the\nfinal mass of the SMBH, showing that it is the growth process rather than the\nactual SMBH mass that alters bar evolution in a way that increases $\\sigma$.

Its original\nformulation, due to Clausius, states that \"Heat can never pass from a colder to\na warmer body without some other change, connected therewith, occurring at the\nsame time\". The second law applies to systems composed of many particles\ninteracting; however, we are seeing that one can make sense of thermodynamics\nin the regime where we only have a small number of particles interacting with a\nheat bath. Is there a second law of thermodynamics in this regime? Here, we\nfind that for processes which are cyclic or very close to cyclic, the second\nlaw for microscopic systems takes on a very different form than it does at the\nmacroscopic scale, imposing not just one constraint on what state\ntransformations are possible, but an entire family of constraints. In\nparticular, we find a family of free energies which generalise the traditional\none, and show that they can never increase. We further find that there are\nthree regimes which determine which family of second laws govern state\ntransitions, depending on how cyclic the process is. In one regime one can\ncause an apparent violation of the usual second law, through a process of\nembezzling work from a large system which remains arbitrarily close to its\noriginal state. These second laws are not only relevant for small systems, but\nalso apply to individual macroscopic systems interacting via long-range\ninteractions, which only satisfy the ordinary second law on average. By making\nprecise the definition of thermal operations, the laws of thermodynamics take\non a simple form with the first law defining the class of thermal operations,\nthe zeroeth law emerging as a unique condition ensuring the theory is\nnontrivial, and the remaining laws being a monotonicity property of our\ngeneralised free energies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 May 2013 22:08:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Sep 2013 08:20:26 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 3 Dec 2013 15:29:52 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 25 Sep 2014 05:08:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-26"}

Combining measurements of\nthe differential conductance and the voltage difference induced by the\ntemperature difference between the conducting lead and the edge state, the Mott\nformula provides a unique way to infer the temperature of the Majorana edge\nstate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 May 2013 00:08:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 May 2013 15:44:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 8 Aug 2013 19:15:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-09"}

The Planck data\nalone can lead to strong and reliable constraint on the HDE parameter c. At 68%\nCL, we get c=0.508+-0.207 with Planck+WP+lensing, favoring the present phantom\nHDE at > 2sigma CL. Comparably, by using WMAP9 alone we cannot get interesting\nconstraint on c. By combining Planck+WP with the BAO measurements from\n6dFGS+SDSS DR7(R)+BOSS DR9, the H0 measurement from HST, the SNLS3 and Union2.1\nSNIa data sets, we get 68% CL constraints c=0.484+-0.070, 0.474+-0.049,\n0.594+-0.051 and 0.642+-0.066.

The fluid flow, which is driven by the time-dependent dynamic\npressure data, is governed by the 2D Navier-Stokes equations for an\nincompressible, viscous fluid, defined on a 2D cylinder. The elastodynamics of\nthe cylinder wall is governed by the 1D linear wave equation modeling the thin\nstructural layer, and by the 2D equations of linear elasticity modeling the\nthick structural layer.

We propose to model the taxa counts using a Dirichlet-multinomial\n(DM) regression model in order to account for overdispersion of observed\ncounts. The DM regression model can be used for testing the association between\ntaxa composition and covariates using the likelihood ratio test. However, when\nthe number of covariates is large, multiple testing can lead to loss of power.\nTo address the high dimensionality of the problem, we develop a penalized\nlikelihood approach to estimate the regression parameters and to select the\nvariables by imposing a sparse group $\\ell_1$ penalty to encourage both\ngroup-level and within-group sparsity. Such a variable selection procedure can\nlead to selection of the relevant covariates and their associated bacterial\ntaxa. An efficient block-coordinate descent algorithm is developed to solve the\noptimization problem.

Very long baseline interferometry\nobservations reveal that the core possesses a distinctive structure in\npolarized intensity with two maxima on axis and two minima symmetrically placed\non either side. The approximately radial pattern of electric field polarization\nrods is reminiscent of the results obtained earlier by Cawthorne (2006) for\nconical shocks, but, individually, these do not reproduce the main features of\nthe polarized intensity images. In numerical simulations and experiments, these\nshocks occur in pairs and help to stabilize jets as they adjust to changes in\nenvironment.

The similarity between the\nobserved and model polarization supports the view that the core structure in\n1803+784 represents a recollimation shock, and that such shock waves may be\nresponsible for the first disturbance and hence brightening of the quiescent\nflow in astrophysical jets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 May 2013 09:27:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

Here we show that these systems could\nbe indirectly detected through the trail that the black holes leave as they\nspiral inwards. We analyze two numerical simulations of inspiralling black\nholes (equal masses and 10:1 mass ratio) in the stellar environment of a\ngalactic centre. We studied the effect of the binary on the structure of the\nstellar population, with particular emphasis on projected kinematics and\ndirectly measurable moments of the velocity distribution.

While this is seen in\nthe average velocity map in the unequal mass case, it is obscured by a more\nstrongly co-rotating outer region in the equal mass case; however, the inner\ncounter-rotation could still be detected by studying the higher moments of the\nvelocity distribution. Additionally, the maps reveal a dip in velocity\ndispersion in the inner region, as well as more pronounced signatures in the\nhigher distribution moments.

To avoid this collinearity a Bayesian localised\nconditional autoregressive model is developed for the random effects.

Leptons,\nwhen compared to hadrons, have only little interaction with the strongly\ninteracting system. Thus, dileptons provide ideal penetrating probes that allow\nthe study of such a system throughout its space-time evolution. In the low mass\nrange ($M_{ll}<1.1$ GeV/$c^2$), the dominant source of dileptons originates\nfrom the decay of vector mesons which may see effects from chiral symmetry\nrestoration. In the intermediate mass range ($1.1<M_{ll}<3.0 $ GeV/$c^2$), the\nmain contributions to the mass spectrum are expected to originate from the\nthermal radiation of a quark-gluon plasma as well as the decays of charm\nmesons.

For instance, the\noscillatory behavior that is a hallmark property of the RKKY exchange coupling\nis strongly suppressed by Stoner enhancement. Although the spin pumping rate of\nferromagnetic films atop palladium is only mildly changed by Stoner enhancement\nthe change is large enough to be detected experimentally. The qualitative\naspects of our results for palladium are expected to remain valid for any\nnon-magnetic substrate where Coulomb repulsion is large.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 May 2013 15:31:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

This article provides\na novel probabilistic framework for assessing whether the semantics of\nconceptual combinations are compositional, and so can be considered as a\nfunction of the semantics of the constituent concepts, or not. While the\nsystematicity and productivity of language provide a strong argument in favor\nof assuming compositionality, this very assumption is still regularly\nquestioned in both cognitive science and philosophy. Additionally, the\nprinciple of semantic compositionality is underspecified, which means that\nnotions of both \"strong\" and \"weak\" compositionality appear in the literature.\nRather than adjudicating between different grades of compositionality, the\nframework presented here contributes formal methods for determining a clear\ndividing line between compositional and non-compositional semantics. In\naddition, we suggest that the distinction between these is contextually\nsensitive. Utilizing formal frameworks developed for analyzing composite\nsystems in quantum theory, we present two methods that allow the semantics of\nconceptual combinations to be classified as \"compositional\" or\n\"non-compositional\". Compositionality is first formalised by factorising the\njoint probability distribution modeling the combination, where the terms in the\nfactorisation correspond to individual concepts. This leads to the necessary\nand sufficient condition for the joint probability distribution to exist. A\nfailure to meet this condition implies that the underlying concepts cannot be\nmodeled in a single probability space when considering their combination, and\nthe combination is thus deemed \"non-compositional\". The formal analysis methods\nare demonstrated by applying them to an empirical study of twenty-four\nnon-lexicalised conceptual combinations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 May 2013 03:14:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 28 Sep 2013 00:27:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 21 Nov 2014 02:15:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-24"}

The approach is physically transparent and subtly different\nin its line of reasoning from standard methods avoiding any semi-classical\napproximation. We find \"internal\" phase transitions (at partial LL filling) for\nmagnetisation and susceptibility that are not captured by other approaches and\nthat give rise to nontrivial violations of the standard de Haas-van Alphen\nperiods, in a manner that reproduces the exact quantal astrophysical behaviours\nin the limit of full three-dimensional (3D) space. Upon inclusion of Zeeman\nsplitting, additional features are also found, such as global energy minima\noriginating from the interplay of QW, Zeeman and LL Physics, while a\ncorresponding calculation in a Composite Fermion picture with {\\Lambda}-Levels,\nleads to new predictions on magnetic properties of an interacting electron\nliquid. By pursuing the same line of reasoning for a topologically nontrivial\nsystem with a relativistic spectrum, we find evidence that similar effects\nmight be operative in the dimensionality crossover of 3D strong topological\ninsulators to 2D topological insulator quantum wells.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 May 2013 21:18:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-29"}
