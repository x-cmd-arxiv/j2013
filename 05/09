For the\nlatter process, a number of numerical simulations have been performed in recent\nyears, but a fully parameter-independent understanding has not been yet\nestablished. In this study, we present simple scaling relations for the\nplanetesimal stirring rate in turbulence driven by magnetorotational\ninstability (MRI), taking into account the stabilization of MRI due to Ohmic\nresistivity. We begin with order-of-magnitude estimates of the\nturbulence-induced gravitational force acting on solid bodies and associated\ndiffusion coefficients for their orbital elements. We then test the predicted\nscaling relations using the results of recent Ohmic-resistive MHD simulations\nby Gressel et al. We find that these relations successfully explain the\nsimulation results if we properly fix order-of-unity uncertainties within the\nestimates. We also update the saturation predictor for the density fluctuation\namplitude in MRI-driven turbulence originally proposed by Okuzumi & Hirose.\nCombination of the scaling relations and saturation predictor allows to know\nhow the turbulent stirring rate of planetesimals depends on disk parameters\nsuch as the gas column density, distance from the central star, vertical\nresistivity distribution, and net vertical magnetic flux.

During runaway growth bodies in the 0.1--100 km size range\n(planetesimals) quickly produce a number of much larger seeds. The runaway\ngrowth phase is essential for planet formation as the emergent planetary\nembryos can accrete the leftover planetesimals at large gravitational focusing\nfactors. However, torques resulting from turbulence-induced density\nfluctuations may violate the criterion for the onset of runaway growth, which\nis that the magnitude of the planetesimals' random (eccentric) motions are less\nthan their escape velocity. This condition represents a more stringent\nconstraint than the condition that planetesimals survive their mutual\ncollisions. To investigate the effects of MRI turbulence on the viability of\nthe runaway growth scenario, we apply our semi-analytical recipes of Paper I,\nwhich we augment by a coagulation/fragmentation model for the dust component.\nWe find that the surface area-equivalent abundance of 0.1 micron particles is\nreduced by factors 10^2--10^3, which tends to render the dust irrelevant to the\nturbulence. We express the turbulent activity in the midplane regions in terms\nof a size s_run above which planetesimals will experience runaway growth. We\nfind that s_run is mainly determined by the strength of the vertical net field\nthat threads the disks and the disk radius. At disk radii beyond 5 AU, s_run\nbecomes larger than ~100 km and the collision times among these bodies longer\nthan the duration of the nebula phase. Our findings imply that the classical,\nplanetesimal-dominated, model for planet formation is not viable in the outer\nregions of a turbulent disk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 May 2013 17:35:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

Given that\nleptons remain in the thermal bath until late times, we focus on their\ninteractions with DM. To illustrate the method, we use the null results of LEP\nmissing energy searches along with Fermi-LAT searches for DM annihilation in\nnearby dwarf galaxies, to derive limits on the protohalo mass, $\\lesssim\n(10^{-6}-10^{-1}) M_{\\odot}$, with the range depending on the DM mass and the\noperator.

We develop a numerical method to\nsearch for such minimal noise subsystems and apply it to a number of examples.\nFor the examples we examine, we find that if the perturbation is local noise\nthen there is no better subspace/subsystem than the original DFS. We also show\nthat if the noise model remains collective, but is perturbed in a way that\nbreaks the symmetry, then the minimal noise subsystem is distinct from the\noriginal DFS, and improves upon it.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 May 2013 00:01:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-09"}

In particular, researchers have developed several disparate\nmetrics to quantify multifunctionality, each characterizing different aspects\nof the concept, and each with pros and cons. We compare four approaches to\ncharacterizing multifunctionality and its dependence on biodiversity,\nquantifying 1) magnitudes of multiple individual functions separately, 2) the\nextent to which different species promote different functions, 3) the average\nlevel of a suite of functions, and 4) the number of functions that\nsimultaneously exceed a critical threshold.

Incorporating the fact that the\ncoefficients lying towards the ends of the histogram plot of each Detail\ncomponent represent the structural information of an image, the quantization\nstep sizes become smaller at they approach the ends of the histogram plot. The\nvariable quantization step sizes are determined by the actual statistics of the\nwavelet coefficients. Mean and standard deviation are the two statistical\nparameters used iteratively to obtain the variable step sizes. Moreover, the\nmean of the coefficients lying within the step size is chosen as the quantized\nvalue, contrary to the deadzone uniform quantizer which selects the midpoint of\nthe quantization step size as the quantized value. The experimental results of\nthe deadzone uniform quantizer and the proposed non-uniform quantizer are\nobjectively compared by using Mean-Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Structural\nSimilarity Index Measure (MSSIM), to evaluate the quantization error and\nreconstructed image quality, respectively. Subjective analysis of the\nreconstructed images is also carried out. Through the objective and subjective\nassessments, it is shown that the non-uniform quantizer performs better than\nthe deadzone uniform quantizer in the perceptual quality of the reconstructed\nimage, especially at low bitrates.

In our previous work, we proposed\nthat tidally enhanced stellar wind during binary evolution may affect the HB\nmorphology by enhancing the mass loss of the red giant primary. As a further\nstudy, we now investigate the effects of metallicity and age on HB morphology\nby considering tidally enhanced stellar winds during binary evolution. We\nincorporated the tidally enhanced-stellar-wind model into Eggleton's stellar\nevolution code to study the binary evolution. To study the effects of\nmetallicity and age on our final results, we conducted two sets of model\ncalculations: (i) for a fixed age, we used three metallicities, namely\nZ=0.0001, 0.001, and 0.02. (ii) For a fixed metallicity, Z=0.001, we used five\nages in our model calculations: 14, 13, 12, 10, and 7 Gyr. We found that HB\nmorphology of GCs becomes bluer with decreasing metallicity, and old GCs\npresent bluer HB morphology than young ones. These results are consistent with\nprevious work. Although the envelope-mass distributions of zero-age HB stars\nproduced by tidally enhanced stellar wind are similar for different\nmetallicities, the synthetic HB under tidally enhanced stellar wind for Z=0.02\npresented a distinct gap between red and blue HB. However, this feature was not\nseen clearly in the synthetic HB for Z=0.001 and 0.0001.

In this paper, we propose a new statistical coefficient that we call\nthe rank minrelation coefficient. We define a minrelation of X to Y (or\nequivalently a majrelation of Y to X) as a measure that estimate p(Y > X) when\nX and Y are continuous random variables. The approach is similar to Lin's\nconcordance coefficient that rather focuses on estimating p(X = Y). In other\nwords, if a variable X exhibits a minrelation to Y then, as X increases, Y is\nlikely to increases too. However, on the contrary to concordance or\ncorrelation, the minrelation is not symmetric. More explicitly, if X decreases,\nlittle can be said on Y values (except that the uncertainty on Y actually\nincreases). In this paper, we formally define this new kind of bivariate\ndependencies and propose a new statistical coefficient in order to detect those\ndependencies. We show through several key examples that this new coefficient\nhas many interesting properties in order to select relevant variables, in\nparticular when compared to correlation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 May 2013 09:09:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-10"}

Evidence was\nagain seen for a fast ionised wind with velocity ~ 0.12c (Tombesi 2010, Pounds\nand Vaughan 2012). Detailed modelling with the XSTAR photoionisation code now\nconfirms the general correlation of velocity and ionisation predicted by mass\nconservation in a Compton-cooled shocked wind (King 2010). We attribute the\nstrong column density gradient in the model to the addition of strong two-body\ncooling in the later stages of the flow, causing the ionisation (and velocity)\nto fall more quickly, and confining the lower ionisation gas to a narrower\nregion. The column density and recombination timescale of the highly ionised\nflow component, seen mainly in Fe K lines, determine the primary shell\nthickness which, when compared with the theoretical Compton cooling length,\ndetermines a shock radius of ~ 10^17 cm. Variable radiative recombination\ncontinua (RRC) provide a key to scaling the lower ionisation gas, with the RRC\nflux then allowing a consistency check on the overall flow geometry. We\nconclude that the 2009 observation of NGC 4051 gives strong support to the idea\nthat a fast, highly ionised wind, launched from the vicinity of the\nsupermassive black hole, will lose much of its mechanical energy after shocking\nagainst the ISM at a sufficiently small radius for strong Compton cooling.\nHowever, the total flow momentum will be conserved, retaining the potential for\na powerful AGN wind to support momentum-driven feedback (King 2003; 2005). We\nspeculate that the `warm absorber' components often seen in AGN spectra result\nfrom accumulation of shocked wind and ejected ISM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 May 2013 10:12:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

There is currently great interest in\nhow these demographic events may have affected the burden of deleterious\nmutations in individuals and the allele frequency spectrum of disease mutations\nin populations. Here we use population genetic models to show that--contrary to\nprevious conjectures--recent human demography has likely had very little impact\non the average burden of deleterious mutations carried by individuals. This\nprediction is supported by exome sequence data showing that African American\nand European American individuals carry very similar burdens of damaging\nmutations. We next consider whether recent population growth has increased the\nimportance of very rare mutations in complex traits. Our analysis predicts that\nfor most classes of disease variants, rare alleles are unlikely to contribute a\nlarge fraction of the total genetic variance, and that the impact of recent\ngrowth is likely to be modest. However, for diseases that have a direct impact\non fitness, strongly deleterious rare mutations likely do play important roles,\nand the impact of very rare mutations will be far greater as a result of recent\ngrowth. In summary, demographic history has dramatically impacted patterns of\nvariation in different human populations, but these changes have likely had\nlittle impact on either genetic load or on the importance of rare variants for\nmost complex traits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 May 2013 11:43:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-10"}

Using numerical simulations of isotropically forced turbulence\nwithout large scale shear with the implications, we focus on several aspects of\nthis comparison that have not been previously tested: (1) Leading mean field\ndynamo theories which break the field into large and small scales predict that\nlarge scale helical field growth rates are determined by the difference between\nkinetic helicity and current helicity with no dependence on the non-helical\nenergy in small scale magnetic fields. Our simulations show that the growth\nrate of the large scale field from fully helical forcing is indeed unaffected\nby the presence or absence of small scale magnetic fields amplified in a\nprecursor non-helical dynamo. However, because the precursor non helical dynamo\nin our simulations produced fields that were strongly sub-equipartition with\nrespect to the kinetic energy, we cannot yet rule out the potential influence\nof stronger non- helical small scale fields. (2) We have identified two\nfeatures in our simulations which cannot be explained by the most minimalist\nversions of two-scale mean field theory: (i) fully helical small scale forcing\nproduces significant non-helical large scale magnetic energy and (ii) the\nsaturation of the large scale field growth is time-delayed with respect to what\nminimalist theory predicts.

The concentration gradient of one ion can drive the flow of\nanother, even in a bulk solution. A variational multiscale approach is needed\nto deal with interactions and flow. The recently developed energetic\nvariational approach to dissipative systems allows mathematically consistent\ntreatment of bio-ions Na, K, Ca and Cl as they interact and flow. Interactions\nproduce large excess free energy that dominate the properties of the high\nconcentration of ions in and near protein active sites, channels, and nucleic\nacids: the number density of ions is often more than 10 M. Ions in such crowded\nquarters interact strongly with each other as well as with the surrounding\nprotein. Non-ideal behavior has classically been ascribed to allosteric\ninteractions mediated by protein conformation changes. Ion-ion interactions\npresent in crowded solutions--independent of conformation changes of\nproteins--are likely to change interpretations of allosteric phenomena.\nComputation of all atoms is a popular alternative to the multiscale approach.\nSuch computations involve formidable challenges.

The most fundamental result to which we pay especial\nattention in this paper, is that the exact Fermi surface (FS) of the uniform\nmetallic ground state (GS) of any single-band Hamiltonian, describing fermions,\nis a subset of the FS within the framework of the exact Hartree-Fock theory. We\nalso review some of the physical implications of the latter result. Our\nconsiderations reveal that the interacting FS of a uniform metallic GS cannot\nbe calculated exactly to order \\nu (\\nu \\ge 2) in the coupling constant \\lambda\nof the interaction potential in terms of the self-energy calculated to order\n\\nu in a non-self-consistent fashion. We show this to be interlinked with the\nfailure of the Luttinger-Ward identity, and thus of the Luttinger theorem, for\na self-energy that is not appropriately related to the single-particle Green\nfunction from which the FS is deduced.

In the\nhigh power limit the critical state model solution is obtained.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 May 2013 14:11:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

This problem, known as physical-layer multicasting, has drawn\nmuch interest. Presently, a popularized approach is transmit beamforming, in\nwhich the beamforming optimization is handled by a rank-one approximation\nmethod called semidefinite relaxation (SDR). SDR-based beamforming has been\nshown to be promising for a small or moderate number of users. This paper\ndescribes two new transceiver strategies for physical-layer multicasting. The\nfirst strategy, called stochastic beamforming (SBF), randomizes the beamformer\nin a per-symbol time-varying manner, so that the rank-one approximation in SDR\ncan be bypassed. We propose several efficiently realizable SBF schemes, and\nprove that their multicast achievable rate gaps with respect to the MISO\nmulticast capacity must be no worse than 0.8314 bits/s/Hz, irrespective of any\nother factors such as the number of users. The use of channel coding and the\nassumption of sufficiently long code lengths play a crucial role in achieving\nthe above result. The second strategy combines transmit beamforming and the\nAlamouti space-time code. The result is a rank-two generalization of SDR-based\nbeamforming. We show by analysis that this SDR-based beamformed Alamouti scheme\nhas a better worst-case effective signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) scaling, and\nhence a better multicast rate scaling, than SDR-based beamforming. We further\nthe work by combining SBF and the beamformed Alamouti scheme, wherein an\nimproved constant rate gap of 0.39 bits/s/Hz is proven. Simulation results show\nthat under a channel-coded, many-user setting, the proposed multicast\ntransceiver schemes yield significant SNR gains over SDR-based beamforming at\nthe same bit error rate level.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 May 2013 15:37:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Jul 2013 09:54:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}
