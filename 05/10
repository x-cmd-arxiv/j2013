However,\nhuman T cell leukaemia virus (HTLV-1), with the potential to invade the same\nhost cell, shows extreme enrichment for the pyrimidine C. Assuming the low GC%\nHIV and the high GC% HTLV-1 to share a common ancestor, it was postulated that\ndifferences in GC% arose to prevent homologous recombination between these\nemerging lentiviral species. Sympatrically isolated by this intracellular\nreproductive barrier, prototypic HIV-1 seized the AU-rich (low GC%) high ground\n(thus committing to purine A rather than purine G). Prototypic HTLV-1 forwent\nthis advantage and evolved an independent evolutionary strategy. Evidence\nsupporting this hypothesis since its elaboration in the 1990s is growing. The\nconflict between the needs to encode accurately both a protein, and nucleic\nacid structure, is often resolved in favour of the nucleic acid because, apart\nfrom regulatory roles, structure is critical for recombination. However, above\na sequence difference threshold, structure (and hence recombination) is\nimpaired. New species can then arise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 May 2013 16:11:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-05"}

From the simulations of these systems it is possible to extract\nsequences of record-breaking avalanches, where each subsequent record-breaking\nevent is larger in magnitude than all previous events. In the present work,\nseveral cellular automata are analyzed among them the sandpile model, Manna\nmodel, Olami-Feder-Christensen (OFC) model, and the forest-fire model to\ninvestigate the record-breaking statistics of model avalanches which exhibit\ntemporal and spatial correlations.

The statistics of record-breaking avalanches for the four models\nare compared to that of record-breaking events extracted from the sequences of\nindependent identically distributed (\\emph{i.i.d.}) random variables.

One possible regulator of motor coordination is the\nelasticity-mediated crosstalk (EMC) coupling between myosin II motors whose\norigin is the tensile stress that they collectively generate in actin\nfilaments. Here, we use a statistical mechanical analysis to investigate the\ninfluence of the EMC effect on the sarcomere - the basic contractile unit of\nskeletal muscles. We demonstrate that the EMC effect leads to an increase in\nthe attachment probability of motors located near the end of the sarcomere\nwhile, simultaneously, decreasing the attachment probability of the motors in\nthe central part. Such a polarized attachment probability would impair the\nmotors ability to cooperate efficiently. Interestingly, this undesired\nphenomenon becomes significant only when the system size exceeds that of the\nsarcomere in skeletal muscles, which provides an explanation for the remarkable\nlack of sarcomere variability in vertebrates. Another phenomenon that we\ninvestigate is the recently observed increase in the duty ratio of the motors\nwith the tension in muscle.

In this paper, we show that both FF (uniform order parameter with\nplane-wave phase) and LO phase (spatially varying order parameter amplitude)\ncan be observed using fermionic cold atoms in spin-orbit coupled optical\nlattices. The increasing spin-orbit coupling enhances the FF phase over the LO\nphase. The coexistence of superfluid and magnetic orders is also found in the\nnormal BCS phase. The pairing mechanism for different phases is understood by\nvisualizing superfluid pairing densities in different spin-orbit bands. The\npossibility of observing similar physics using spin-orbit coupled\nsuperconducting ultra-thin films is also discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 May 2013 17:25:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 21 Feb 2014 04:48:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-24"}

Although motivated by the solar context, this model cannot be\nthought of as a realistic model of the rise of magnetic structures and their\nemergence in the Sun where the local dynamics are completely different.

We present analyses of such data, where\nabsorption troughs from three important ions are measured: first, O IV and O\nIV* that allow us to obtain the distance of high ionization outflows from the\nAGN; second, Ne VIII and Mg X that are sensitive to the very high ionization\nphase of the outflow. Their inferred column densities, combined with those of\ntroughs from O VI, N IV, and H I, yield two important results: 1) The outflow\nshows two ionization phases, where the high ionization phase carries the bulk\nof the material. This is similar to the situation seen in x-ray warm absorber\nstudies.

This fundamental prediction arises from the\nfact that quasar activity (i.e., BH accretion with luminosity greater than\n10^46 erg/sec) is inhibited in DM haloes where AGN feedback operates. The\ngalaxy hosts of quasars in our simulations are identified with over massive (in\ngas and stars) spheroidal galaxies, in which BH accretion is triggered via a\ngalaxy merger or secular processes. We further show that the z=0 descendants of\nhigh redshift (z~6) QSOs span a wide range of morphologies, galaxy and halo\nmasses. The z~6 BHs typically grow only by a modest factor by the present day.\nRemarkably, high redshift QSOs never inhabit the largest DM haloes at that time\nand their descendants are very seldom found in the most massive haloes at z=0.\nWe also show that observationally it is very likely to find an enhancement in\nthe abundance of galaxies around quasars at z~5. However, these enhancements\nare considerably weaker compared to the overdensities expected at the extreme\npeaks of the DM distribution. Thus, it is very unlikely that a quasar detected\nin the $z\\gtrsim5$ Universe pinpoints the location of the progenitors of\nsuperclusters in the local Universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 May 2013 20:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

We then compare our findings to the\ntheoretical predictions of the coupled galaxy and black hole formation model\nGALFORM. We find good agreement when our calculation includes the hot-halo mode\nof accretion onto the central black hole. This type of accretion, which is\nadditional to the common cold accretion during disk instabilities and galaxy\nmergers, is tightly coupled to the AGN feedback in the model. The hot-halo mode\nbecomes prominent in DM haloes with masses greater than ~10^12.5 Msun, where\nAGN feedback typically operates, giving rise to a distinct class of moderate\nluminosity AGN that inhabit rich clusters and superclusters. Cold gas fuelling\nof the black hole cannot produce the observationally inferred DM halo masses of\nX-ray AGN. Switching off AGN feedback in the model results in a large\npopulation of luminous quasars (Lx(2-10 keV) > 10^44 erg/sec) in DM haloes with\nmasses up to ~10^14 Msun, which is inconsistent with the observed clustering of\nquasars. The abundance of hot-halo AGN decreases significantly in the z~3-4\nuniverse. At such high redshifts, the cold accretion mode is solely responsible\nfor shaping the environment of moderate luminosity AGN.

The morphology of Fomalhaut b appears elliptical in the STIS detections. We\nshow that residual noise in the processed data can plausibly result in point\nsources appearing extended. A MCMC analysis demonstrates that the orbit of Fom\nb is highly eccentric, with e=0.8+/-0.1, a=177+/-68 AU, and q = 32+/-24 AU. Fom\nb is apsidally aligned with the belt and 90% of allowed orbits have mutual\ninclination 36 deg or less.

The new value for the periastron distance diminishes the Hill\nradius of Fom b and any weakly bound satellite system surrounding a planet\nwould be sheared and dynamically heated at periapse.

We find that the appropriate notion of model is a special kind of\npromonoidal category. Since the theory of promonoidal categories has not been\ndeveloped very thoroughly, at least in the published literature, we need to\ndevelop it here. The most natural way to do this - and the simplest, once the\n(substantial) groundwork has been laid - is to consider promonoidal categories\nas an instance of the general theory of pseudomonoids in a monoidal bicategory.\nAccordingly, we describe and explain the notions of monoidal bicategory and\npseudomonoid therein.\n  The higher-dimensional nature of monoidal bicategories presents serious\nnotational difficulties, since to use the natural analogue of the commutative\ndiagrams used in ordinary category theory would require the use of\nthree-dimensional diagrams. We therefore introduce a novel technical device,\nwhich we dub the calculus of components, that simplifies the business of\nreasoning about a certain class of algebraic structure internal to a monoidal\nbicategory. When viewed through this simplifying lens, the theory of\npseudomonoids turns out to be essentially formally identical to the ordinary\ntheory of monoidal categories. We indicate how the calculus of components may\nbe extended to cover structures that make use of the braiding in a braided\nmonoidal bicategory, and use this to study braided pseudomonoids.\n  A higher-dimensional analogue of Cayley's theorem is proved, and used to\ndeduce a novel characterisation of the unit of a promonoidal category. This,\nand the other preceding work, is then used to give two characterisations of the\ncategories that model the unitless fragment of intuitionistic multiplicative\nlinear logic. Finally we consider the non-intuitionistic case, where the second\ncharacterisation in particular takes a surprisingly simple form.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 May 2013 23:32:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-14"}

This optical interrogation offers high accuracy and\nreliability compared to direct measurements of elongation, particularly at\nlower temperatures, thus avoiding significant experimental error. An excellent\nArrhenius fit is obtained from which an activation energy for viscous flow of\nEa = 450 kJ/mol is extracted; addition of an additional temperature dependent\npre-exponential does not change this value. This value is less than that\nidealised by some literature but consistent with other literature. The log plot\nof viscosity is overall found to be consistent with that reported in the\nliterature for silica measurements on rod and beams, but substantially higher\nto past work reported for optical fibres. The discrepancy from an idealised\nactivation energy Ea ~ 700 kJ/mol may be explained by noting the higher fictive\ntemperature of the fibre. On the other hand, past optical fibre results\nobtained by beam bending with much lower values leave questions regarding the\nmethod of viscosity measurement and the time taken for structural\nequilibration. We note that because regenerated gratings already involve\npost-annealing to stabilise their operation at higher temperature, the\nstructures are much more relaxed compared to normal fibres.

Here we discuss how ecological principles can be used\nto better understand cancer progression and treatment, using several\nmathematical and computational models to illustrate our argument.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 May 2013 02:36:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-13"}

We surprisingly find that no\nlatent variables are introduced in the Leeds Sport Dataset (LSP) during\nlearning latent trees for deformable model, which aims at approximating the\njoint distributions of body part locations using minimal tree structure. This\nsuggests one can straightforwardly use a mixed representation of single and\ncombined parts to approximate their joint distribution in a simple tree model.\nAs such, one only needs to build Visual Categories of the combined parts, and\nthen perform inference on the learned latent tree. Our method outperformed the\nstate of the art on the LSP, both in the scenarios when the training images are\nfrom the same dataset and from the PARSE dataset.

Surface registration between simple surfaces,\nsuch as simply-connected open surfaces, has been well studied. However, very\nfew works have been carried out for the registration of high-genus surfaces.\nThe high-genus topology of the surface poses great challenge for surface\nregistration. A possible approach is to partition surfaces into\nsimply-connected patches and registration is done patch by patch. Consistent\ncuts are required, which are usually difficult to obtain and prone to error. In\nthis work, we propose an effective way to obtain geometric registration between\nhigh-genus surfaces without introducing consistent cuts. The key idea is to\nconformally parameterize the surface into its universal covering space, which\nis either the Euclidean plane or the hyperbolic disk embedded in\n$\\mathbb{R}^2$. Registration can then be done on the universal covering space\nby minimizing a shape mismatching energy measuring the geometric dissimilarity\nbetween the two surfaces. Our proposed algorithm effectively computes a smooth\nregistration between high-genus surfaces that matches geometric information as\nmuch as possible. The algorithm can also be applied to find a smooth and\nbijective registration minimizing any general energy functionals. Numerical\nexperiments on high-genus surface data show that our proposed method is\neffective for registering high-genus surfaces with geometric matching. We also\napplied the method to register anatomical structures for medical imaging, which\ndemonstrates the usefulness of the proposed algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 May 2013 08:48:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-27"}

However, coronal seismology in EUV lines fails for higher\naltitudes because of rapid decrease in line intensity. We aim to use radio\nobservations to estimate the plasma parameters of the outer solar corona (> 0.2\nR_0). We use the large Ukrainian radio telescope URAN-2 to observe type IV\nradio burst at the frequency range of 8-32 MHz during the time interval of\n09:50-12:30 UT in April 14, 2011. The burst was connected to C2.3 flare, which\noccurred in AR 11190 during 09:38-09:49 UT. The dynamic spectrum of radio\nemission shows clear quasi-periodic variations in the emission intensity at\nalmost all frequencies. Wavelet analysis at four different frequencies (29 MHz,\n25 MHz, 22 MHz and 14 MHz) shows the quasi-periodic variation of emission\nintensity with periods of 34 min and 23 min. The periodic variations can be\nexplained by the first and second harmonics of vertical kink oscillation of\ntransequatorial coronal loops, which were excited by the same flare. The apex\nof transequatorial loops may reach up to 1.2 R_0 altitude. We derive and solve\nthe dispersion relation of trapped MHD oscillations in a longitudinally\ninhomogeneous magnetic slab.

We combined\nthese spectral line data with our previous SABOCA 350-{\\mu}m dust continuum map\nof the source. The subfragments are characterised by subsonic internal\nnon-thermal motions ({\\sigma}NT~0.5cs), and most of them appear to be\ngravitationally bound. The dispersion of the N2H+ velocity centroids among the\ncondensations is very low (0.02 km/s). The CO depletion factors we derive,\nfD=0.8+/-0.4 - 3.6+/-1.5, do not suggest any significant CO freeze-out but this\nmay be due to the canonical CO abundance we adopt. The fractional abundances of\nN2H+ and N2D+ with respect to H2 are found to be ~0.9-2.3x10^-9 and\n~4.9-9.9x10^-10, respectively. The deuterium fractionation of N2H+, or the\nN2D+/N2H+ column density ratio, lies in the range 0.30+/-0.07 - 0.43+/-0.09.\nThe detected substructure inside SMM 6 is likely the result of cylindrical\nJeans-type gravitational fragmentation. We estimate the timescale for this\nfragmentation to be ~1.8x10^5 yr. The condensations are unlikely to be able to\ninteract with one another and coalesce before local gravitational collapse\nensues. Moreover, significant mass growth of the condensations via\ncompetitive-like accretion from the parent core seems unfeasible. The high\nlevel of molecular deuteration in the condensations suggests that gas-phase CO\nshould be strongly depleted. It also points towards an advanced stage of\nchemical evolution. The subfragments of SMM 6 might therefore be near the onset\nof gravitational collapse, but whether they can form protostellar or substellar\nobjects (brown dwarfs) depends on the local star formation efficiency and\nremains to be clarified.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 May 2013 09:17:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

We also show how,\ne.g., an anti-covariant pair of anti-representations of $A$ and $G$ can be\nviewed as a covariant pair for a related Banach algebra dynamical system, so\nthat the earlier work becomes applicable to classes of such other pairs. After\nincluding material on the representations of the projective tensor product of\nBanach algebras, we combine this idea with the results already obtained and\ndescribe the two-sided modules over the generalized Beurling algebras, where\nagain specializing to the scalars gives a classical result.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 May 2013 10:43:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-24"}

Our\narguments are based on nearly-resonant interactions of the R mode with pairs of\n\"daughter modes\". The amplitude of the R mode saturates at the lowest value for\nwhich parametric instability leads to significant excitation of a particular\npair of daughters. The lower bound on this limiting amplitude is proportional\nto the damping rate of the daughter modes that are excited parametrically.\nBased on this picture, we show that if modes damp because of dissipation in a\nvery thin boundary layer at the crust-core boundary then spin up to frequencies\nlarger than about 300 Hz does not occur. Within this conventional scenario the\nR mode saturates at an amplitude that is too large for angular momentum gain\nfrom accretion to overcome gravitational loss to gravitational radiation. We\nconclude that lower dissipation is required for spin up to frequencies much\nhigher than 300 Hz. We conjecture that if the transition from the fluid core to\nthe crystalline crust occurs over a distance much longer than 1 cm then a sharp\nviscous boundary layer fails to form. In this case, damping is due to shear\nviscosity dissipation integrated over the entire star; the rate is slower than\nif a viscous boundary layer forms. We use statistical arguments and scaling\nrelations to estimate the lowest parametric instability threshold from first\nprinciples. The resulting saturation amplitudes are low enough to permit spin\nup to higher frequencies. Further, we show that the requirement that the lowest\nparametric instability amplitude be small enough to allow continued spin up\nimposes an upper bound to the frequencies that may be attained via accretion\nthat may plausibly be about 750 Hz. Within this framework, the R mode is\nunstable for all millisecond pulsars, whether accreting or not.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 May 2013 13:15:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 Sep 2013 10:21:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-30"}

Because this problem is fundamentally ill-posed,\nstrong priors on both the sharp image and blur kernel are required to\nregularize the solution space. While this naturally leads to a standard MAP\nestimation framework, performance is compromised by unknown trade-off parameter\nsettings, optimization heuristics, and convergence issues stemming from\nnon-convexity and/or poor prior selections. To mitigate some of these problems,\na number of authors have recently proposed substituting a variational Bayesian\n(VB) strategy that marginalizes over the high-dimensional image space leading\nto better estimates of the blur kernel. However, the underlying cost function\nnow involves both integrals with no closed-form solution and complex,\nfunction-valued arguments, thus losing the transparency of MAP. Beyond standard\nBayesian-inspired intuitions, it thus remains unclear by exactly what mechanism\nthese methods are able to operate, rendering understanding, improvements and\nextensions more difficult. To elucidate these issues, we demonstrate that the\nVB methodology can be recast as an unconventional MAP problem with a very\nparticular penalty/prior that couples the image, blur kernel, and noise level\nin a principled way. This unique penalty has a number of useful characteristics\npertaining to relative concavity, local minima avoidance, and scale-invariance\nthat allow us to rigorously explain the success of VB including its existing\nimplementational heuristics and approximations. It also provides strict\ncriteria for choosing the optimal image prior that, perhaps\ncounter-intuitively, need not reflect the statistics of natural scenes. In so\ndoing we challenge the prevailing notion of why VB is successful for blind\ndeconvolution while providing a transparent platform for introducing\nenhancements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 May 2013 15:09:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-13"}

As a result, the all particle\ncosmic ray energy spectrum starts to exhibit more structures than could be seen\npreviously. Most importantly, a second knee in the cosmic ray spectrum --\ndominated by heavy primaries -- is reported just below 10^{17} eV. The light\ncomponent, on the other hand, exhibits an ankle like feature above 10^{17} eV\nand starts to dominate the flux at the ankle. The key question at the highest\nenergies is about the origin of the flux suppression observed at energies above\n5 x 10^{19} eV. Is this the long awaited GZK-effect or the exhaustion of\nsources? The key to answering this question is again given by the still largely\nunknown mass composition at the highest energies.

In every round, teams throw four\nwooden sticks of the shape of half-cut cylinder and the number of sticks that\nshow belly sides, i.e., the flat sides, determines the number of steps the\nteam's piece can advance on the board. It is possible to pile up one team's\npieces if their sites are identical so that pieces as a group can move together\nafterwards (piling). If a piece of the opponent team is at the new site of one\nteam's piece, the piece is caught and removed from the board, and the team is\ngiven one more chance to throw sticks and proceed (catching). For a simplicity,\nwe simulate this game on one-dimensional board with the same number of sites as\nthe original game, and show that catching is more advantageous strategy than\npiling to win.

The\npolarization curves that evaluate the corrosion kinetics of electrodes in\ncorrosive media are an application where the behavior is chiefly analyzed from\nprofiles. Polarization curves are indeed a classic method to determine the\nglobal kinetics of metallic electrodes, but the strong nonlinearity from\ndifferent metals and alloys can overlap and the discrimination becomes a\nchallenging problem. Moreover, even finding a typical curve from replicated\ntests requires subjective judgement. In this paper we used the so-called\nmulti-q approach based on the Tsallis statistics in a classification engine to\nseparate multiple polarization curve profiles of two stainless steels. We\ncollected 48 experimental polarization curves in aqueous chloride medium of two\nstainless steel types, with different resistance against localized corrosion.\nMulti-q pattern analysis was then carried out on a wide potential range, from\ncathodic up to anodic regions. An excellent classification rate was obtained,\nat a success rate of 90%, 80%, and 83% for low (cathodic), high (anodic), and\nboth potential ranges, respectively, using only 2% of the original profile\ndata.

By analyzing the relations among transfer matrices of the 3D Ising\nmodel, Reidemeister moves in the knot theory, Yang-Baxter and tetrahedron\nequations, the following facts are illustrated for the 3D Ising model: 1) The\ncomplexified quaternion basis constructed for the 3D Ising model represents\nnaturally the rotation in a (3 + 1) - dimensional space-time, as a relativistic\nquantum statistical mechanics model, which is consistent with the 4-fold\nintegrand of the partition function by taking the time average. 2) A unitary\ntransformation with a matrix being a spin representation in 2^(nlo)-space\ncorresponds to a rotation in 2nlo-space, which serves to smooth all the\ncrossings in the transfer matrices and contributes as the non-trivial topologic\npart of the partition function of the 3D Ising model. 3) A tetrahedron relation\nwould ensure the commutativity of the transfer matrices and the integrability\nof the 3D Ising model, and its existence is guaranteed also by the Jordan\nalgebra and the Jordan-von Neumann-Wigner procedures. 4) The unitary\ntransformation for smoothing the crossings in the transfer matrices changes the\nwave functions by complex phases {\\Phi}x, {\\Phi}y, and {\\Phi}z. The relation\nwith quantum field and gauge theories, physical significance of weight factors\nare discussed in details.

The analyticity in {\\beta} = 1/(kB T) of both the hard-core and\nIsing models has been proved for {\\beta} > 0, not for {\\beta} = 0. Thus the\nhigh-temperature series cannot serve as a standard for judging a putative exact\nsolution of the 3D Ising model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 May 2013 01:47:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-15"}
