Aims: This paper shows that the sensitivity of the IceCube\nneutrino telescope in its 40-string configuration (IC-40) is already at the\nlevel of constraining the parameter space of purely hadronic scenarios of\nactivity of blazars. Methods: Assuming that the entire source power originates\nfrom hadronic interactions, and assuming that the models describe the data, we\nestimate the expected neutrino flux from blazars based on the observed\ngamma-ray flux by Fermi, simultaneously with IC-40 observations. We consider\ntwo cases separately to keep the number of constrainable parameters at an\nacceptable level: proton-proton or proton-gamma interactions are dominant.\nComparing the IC-40 sensitivity to the neutrino flux expected from some of the\nbrightest blazars, we constrain model parameters characterizing the parent\nhigh-energy proton spectrum. Results: We find that when pp interactions\ndominate, some constraints on the primary proton spectrum can be imposed. For\ninstance, for the tightest constrained source 3C 454.3, the very high energy\npart of the spectra of blazars is constrained to be harder than E^-2 with\ncut-off energies in the range of Ecut >10^18 eV. When interactions of\nhigh-energy protons on soft photon fields dominate, we can find similarly tight\nconstraints on the proton spectrum parameters.

Several recombination lines, including higher order transitions,\nwere detected for the first time at radio wavelengths in this source. From\nthree alpha-transitions we derive an accurate value for the stellar velocity\nand, for the first time, an unambiguous expansion velocity of the wind which is\n55 km/s, much slower than reported previously, and the mass loss rate is 1.8e-6\nsolar masses per year. The wide band continuum spectra and the interferometer\nvisibilities show that the density of the wind falls off more steeply than\ncompatible with constant-velocity expansion. We argue that these properties\nindicate that the wind is launched from a radially narrow region of the\ncircumstellar disk, and we propose that slow speed and a steep density gradient\nare characteristic properties of the evolutionary phase where young stars of\nintermediate and high mass clear away the gaseous component of their accretion\ndisks.\n  The recombination lines are emitted close to local thermal equilibrium, but\nthe higher order transitions appear systematically broader and weaker than\nexpected, probably due to impact broadening. Finally, we show that LkHalpha101\nshares many properties with MWC349, the only other stellar wind source where\nradio recombination lines have been detected, some of them masing.

First, we introduce the RB recipe: Galerkin projection onto a space\n$Y_N$ spanned by solutions of the governing PDE at $N$ selected points in\nparameter space. This set of $N$ parameter points is constructed by the\nstandard POD-Greedy sampling procedure already developed.

Here we\nreview recent work on the representation and analysis of temporal networks of\nface-to-face human proximity, based on large-scale datasets collected in the\ncontext of the SocioPatterns collaboration. We show that the raw behavioral\ndata can be studied at various levels of coarse-graining, which turn out to be\ncomplementary to one another, with each level exposing different features of\nthe underlying system.

We show that simulating dynamical processes on empirical\ntemporal networks can unveil differences between datasets that would otherwise\nlook statistically similar.

In this article, we\nexplain the answer to these questions which was obtained in arXiv:0908.3628, in\nterms of combinatorial data coming from the Weyl group.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 May 2013 16:59:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 9 Sep 2013 01:38:34 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 1 Nov 2014 15:19:20 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 13 Feb 2016 19:15:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-16"}

A further\nfive stations have been deployed throughout Germany, and one station has been\nbuilt in each of France, Sweden, and the UK. Digital beam-forming techniques\nmake the LOFAR system agile and allow for rapid repointing of the telescope as\nwell as the potential for multiple simultaneous observations. With its dense\ncore array and long interferometric baselines, LOFAR achieves unparalleled\nsensitivity and angular resolution in the low-frequency radio regime. The LOFAR\nfacilities are jointly operated by the International LOFAR Telescope (ILT)\nfoundation, as an observatory open to the global astronomical community. LOFAR\nis one of the first radio observatories to feature automated processing\npipelines to deliver fully calibrated science products to its user community.\nLOFAR's new capabilities, techniques and modus operandi make it an important\npathfinder for the Square Kilometre Array (SKA).

However, a wide range of observationally limited values of the\nblack hole mass implies low precision of the spin estimates. We discuss the\npossibility of higher precision of the black hole spin measurements in the\nframework of a multi-resonance model inspired by observations of more than two\nHF QPOs in the black hole systems, which are expected to occur at two (or more)\ndifferent radii of the accretion disc. For the black hole systems we focus on\nthe special case of duplex frequencies, when the top, bottom, or mixed\nfrequency is common at two different radii where the resonances occur giving\ntriple frequency sets. The sets of triple frequency ratios and the related spin\nare given. The strong resonance model for \"magic\" values of the black hole spin\nmeans that two (or more) versions of resonance could occur at the same radius,\nallowing cooperative effects between the resonances. For neutron star systems\nwe introduce a resonant switch model that assumes switching of oscillatory\nmodes at resonant points. In the case of doubled twin-peak HF QPOs excited at\ntwo different radii with common top, bottom, or mixed frequency, the black hole\nspin is given by the triple frequency ratio set. The spin is determined\nprecisely, but not uniquely, because the same frequency set could correspond to\nmore than one concrete spin. The black hole mass is given by the magnitude of\nthe observed frequencies. The resonant switch model puts relevant limits on the\nmass and spin of neutron stars, and we expect a strong increase in the fitting\nprocedure precision when different twin oscillatory modes are applied to data\nin the vicinity of different resonant points.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 May 2013 17:19:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-16"}

To address these challenges, we present\nSoftCell, a scalable architecture for supporting fine-grained policies for\nmobile devices in cellular core networks. The SoftCell controller realizes\nhigh-level service polices by directing traffic over paths that traverse a\nsequence of middleboxes, optimized to the network conditions and user\nlocations. To ensure scalability, the core switches forward traffic on\nhierarchical addresses (grouped by base station) and policy tags (identifying\npaths through middleboxes). This minimizes data-plane state in the core\nswitches, and pushes all fine-grained state to software switches at the base\nstations. These access switches apply fine-grained rules, specified by the\ncontroller, to map all traffic to the appropriate addresses and tags. SoftCell\nguarantees that packets in the same connection traverse the same sequence of\nmiddleboxes in both directions, even in the presence of mobility. Our\ncharacterization of real LTE workloads, micro-benchmarks on our prototype\ncontroller, and large-scale simulations demonstrate that SoftCell improves the\nflexibility of cellular core networks, while enabling the use of inexpensive\ncommodity switches and middleboxes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 May 2013 18:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-16"}

Despite their importance, the number of\ngravitational arcs discovered so far is small. The urge for more complete,\nlarge samples and unbiased methods of selecting candidates is rising. A number\nof methods for the automatic detection of arcs have been proposed in the\nliterature, but large amounts of spurious detections retrieved by these methods\nforces observers to visually inspect thousands of candidates per square degree\nin order to clean the samples. This approach is largely subjective and requires\na huge amount of eye-ball checking, especially considering the actual and\nupcoming wide field surveys, which will cover thousands of square degrees. In\nthis paper we study the statistical properties of colours of gravitational arcs\ndetected in the 37 deg^2 of the CARS survey. We have found that most of them\nlie in a relatively small region of the (g'-r',r'-i') colour-colour diagram. To\nexplain this property, we provide a model which includes the lensing optical\ndepth expected in a LCDM cosmology that, in combination with the sources'\nredshift distribution of a given survey, in our case CARS, peaks for sources at\nredshift z~1. By further modelling the colours derived from the SED of the\ngalaxies dominating the population at that redshift, the model well reproduces\nthe observed colours. By taking advantage of the colour selection suggested by\nboth data and model, we show that this multi-band filtering returns a sample\n83% complete and a contamination reduced by a factor of ~6.5 with respect to\nthe single-band arcfinder sample. New arc candidates are also proposed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 May 2013 20:00:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 6 Mar 2014 14:50:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

We revisit this\nclaim by examining the predictions from dynamical realisations based on new MGE\nmodels of NGC1277. We present realisations which fit the observed photometry.\nM/L is fixed following scaling relations which predict a Salpeter-like IMF. A\nmodel without a BH provides a surprisingly good fit of the observed kinematics\noutside the unresolved central region, but not, as expected, of the central\ndispersion and h4 values. A model with a MBH of 5 10^9 Msun allows to fit the\ndispersion profile, consistently with models of the same mass and M/L in\nvdB+12. It departs from the central h4 values by only about twice the given\nuncertainty. A slightly varying M/L or the addition of high velocity stars\nwould further lower the need for a very massive BH. These results do not rule\nout the presence of an over-massive BH at the centre of NGC1277. However, they\nlead us to advocate the use of 3-sigma confidence intervals for derived MBH as\nbetter, more conservative, guidelines for such studies. We caution for the use\nof ill-defined spheroidal components as an input for scaling relations, and\nemphasise the fact that a MBH in the range 2-5 10^9 Msun would represent less\nthan 5% of the spheroid mass of our models. This would make the BH in NGC1277\nconsistent or just twice as large as what a recent version of the MBH-sigma\nrelation predicts. We examine the impact of the presence of a bar by running\nsimulations from the same MGE model but with extreme anisotropies. An inner\nsmall bar forms, and an end-on view gets closer to fitting the central\ndispersion profile without the need for a central BH, while adding a black hole\nof 2.5 10^9 Msun, in line with the prediction from scaling relations, allows to\nfit the dispersion peak and h3 profiles.

Furthermore, inherent\nproperties of exact kinetic-Monte Carlo simulation methods limit the efficiency\nof parallel implementations. Several approximate and hybrid methods have\nappeared that enable more efficient simulation of the RDME. A common feature to\nmost of them is that they rely on splitting the system into its reaction and\ndiffusion parts and updating them sequentially over a discrete timestep. This\nuse of operator splitting enables more efficient simulation but it comes at the\nprice of a temporal discretization error that depends on the size of the\ntimestep. So far, existing methods have not attempted to estimate or control\nthis error in a systematic manner. This makes the solvers hard to use for\npractitioners since they must guess an appropriate timestep. It also makes the\nsolvers potentially less efficient than if the timesteps are adapted to control\nthe error. Here, we derive estimates of the local error and propose a strategy\nto adaptively select the timestep when the RDME is simulated via a first order\noperator splitting. While the strategy is general and applicable to a wide\nrange of approximate and hybrid methods, we exemplify it here by extending a\npreviously published approximate method, the Diffusive Finite-State Projection\n(DFSP) method, to incorporate temporal adaptivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 May 2013 21:18:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

We relax this assumption by\nperforming two-dimensional resistive magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the\nplasmoid instability during asymmetric inflow magnetic reconnection. Magnetic\nasymmetry modifies the onset, scaling, and dynamics of this instability.\nMagnetic islands develop preferentially into the weak magnetic field upstream\nregion. Outflow jets from individual X-points impact plasmoids obliquely rather\nthan directly as in the symmetric case. Consequently, deposition of momentum by\nthe outflow jets into the plasmoids is less efficient, the plasmoids develop\nnet vorticity, and shear flow slows down secondary merging between islands.\nSecondary merging events have asymmetry along both the inflow and outflow\ndirections. Downstream plasma is more turbulent in cases with magnetic\nasymmetry because islands are able to roll around each other after exiting the\ncurrent sheet. As in the symmetric case, plasmoid formation facilitates faster\nreconnection for at least small and moderate magnetic asymmetries. However,\nwhen the upstream magnetic field strengths differ by a factor of four, the\nreconnection rate plateaus at a lower value than expected from scaling the\nsymmetric results.

In the Alice-Bob EPR paradigm, non-contextuality means that\nthe identity of Alice's spin (i.e., the probability space on which it is\ndefined as a random variable) is determined only by the axis \\alphai chosen by\nAlice, irrespective of Bob's axis \\betaj (and vice versa). Here, we study\ncontextual KPT models, with two properties: (1) Alice's and Bob's spins are\nidentified as Aij and Bij, even though their distributions are determined by,\nrespectively, \\alphai alone and \\betaj alone, in accordance with the\nno-signaling requirement; and (2) the joint distributions of the spins Aij,Bij\nacross all values of \\alphai,\\betaj are constrained by fixing distributions of\nsome subsets thereof. Of special interest among these subsets is the set of\nprobabilistic connections, defined as the pairs \\left(Aij,Aij'\\right) and\n\\left(Bij,Bi'j\\right) with \\alphai\\not=\\alphai' and \\betaj\\not=\\betaj' (the\nnon-contextuality assumption is obtained as a special case of connections, with\nzero probabilities of Aij\\not=Aij' and Bij\\not=Bi'j). Thus, one can achieve a\ncomplete KPT characterization bof the Bell-type inequalities, or Tsirelson's\ninequalities, by specifying the distributions of probabilistic connections\ncompatible with those and only those spin pairs \\left(Aij,Bij\\right) that are\nsubject to these inequalities.

It\nis difficult to obtain rotation periods for stars of solar age from\nground-based observations, as a low activity level imply a shallow rotational\nmodulation of their light curves. CoRoT has provided space-based long time\nseries from which the rotation periods of solar twins as old as the Sun could\nbe estimated. Based on high S/N high resolution spectroscopic observations\ngathered at the Subaru Telescope, we show that the star CoRoT ID 102684698\n(CoRoT Sol 1) is a somewhat evolved solar twin with a low Li abundance. Its\nrotation period is 29 +- 5 days, compatible with its age (6.7 Gyr) and low\nlithium content A(Li) < 0.85 dex. Interestingly, our CoRoT solar twin seems to\nhave enhanced abundances of the refractory elements with respect to the Sun, a\ntypical characteristic of most nearby twins. With a magnitude V ~14.1, ID\n102684698 is the first solar twin revealed by CoRoT, the farthest field solar\ntwin so far known, and the only solar twin older than the Sun for which a\nrotation period has been determined.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 May 2013 22:36:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

However,\nUCDs typically have sizes more than twice as large as nuclei at the same\nluminosity. We use a GPU-enabled version of the particle-mesh code\n\\textsc{superbox} to study the possibility of turning nucleated dwarf galaxies\ninto UCDs by tidally stripping them in a Virgo-like galaxy cluster. We find\nthat motion in spherical potentials, where close passages happen many times,\nleads to the formation of compact ($r_h \\lesssim 20$ pc) star clusters/UCDs. In\ncontrast, orbital motion where close passages happen only once or twice leads\nto the formation of extended objects which are large enough to account for the\nfull range of observed UCD sizes. For such motion, we find that dwarf galaxies\nneed close pericentre passages with distances less than 10 kpc to undergo\nstrong enough stripping so that UCD formation is possible. As tidal stripping\nproduces objects with similar properties to UCDs, and our estimates suggest\ndwarf galaxies have been destroyed in sufficient numbers to explain the\nobserved number of UCDs in M87, we consider tidal stripping to be a likely\norigin of UCDs. However, comparison with cosmological simulations is needed to\ndetermine if the number and spatial distribution of UCDs formed by tidal\nstripping matches the observations of UCDs in galaxy clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 May 2013 23:50:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

However, both the\nmagnitude and direction of the recoil are shape dependent, a feature of the\nlaser-based remediation concept that has received little attention. Since the\ndevelopment of a predictive capability is desirable, we have investigated the\ndynamical response to ablation of objects comprising a variety of shapes.

We apply a variant\nof Newman-Girvan modularity to this problem known as distance modularity. To\naddress the problem of finding geographically disperse communities, we modify\nthe well-known Louvain algorithm to find partitions of networks that provide\nnear-optimal solutions to this quantity. We apply this algorithm to numerous\nsamples from two real-world social networks and a terrorism network data set\nwhose nodes have associated geospatial locations. Our experiments show this to\nbe an effective approach and highlight various practical considerations when\napplying the algorithm to distance modularity maximization. Several military,\nintelligence, and law-enforcement organizations are working with us to further\ntest and field software for this emerging application.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 May 2013 01:50:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-17"}

This is in agreement\nwith the Balmer line gradients found in local low luminosity E+A galaxies. The\nresults from higher redshift (z~0.1) samples of luminous E+A galaxies have been\nvaried, but in general have found the post-starburst signature to be extended\nor a galaxy-wide phenomenon or have otherwise failed to detect gradients in the\nstellar populations. The ubiquity of the detection of a centrally concentrated\nyoung stellar population in local samples, and the presence of significant\nradial gradients in the stellar populations when the E+A galaxy core is well\nresolved raises the possibility that spatial resolution issues may be important\nin interpreting the higher redshift results. The two early type E+A galaxies in\nour sample that can be robustly kinematically classified, using the LambdaR\nparameter, are fast-rotators. Combined with previous measurements, this brings\nthe total number of E+A galaxies with measurements of LambdaR to twenty-six,\nwith only four being classified as slow-rotators. This fraction is similar to\nthe fraction of the early-type population as a whole and argues against the\nneed for major mergers in the production of E+A galaxies, since major mergers\nshould result in an increased fraction of slow rotators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 May 2013 02:02:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

Spectral types of these targets are found to lie in the range\ndM4.5--dM8.5, implying spectrophotometric distances from 17 pc to 80 pc. Limits\nto the presence of transiting planets are placed from modelling of the Kepler\nlight curves. We find that the size of the planets detectable by Kepler around\nthese small stars typically lie in the range 1 to 5 Earth radii within the\nhabitable regions (P$\\le$10 days). We identify one candidate transit with a\nperiod of 1.26 days that resembles the signal produced by a planet slightly\nsmaller than the Moon.

Lett. 112, 151101 (2014)], we introduced a new scenario that explains the\nexistence of rapidly rotating warm neutron stars (NSs) observed in low-mass\nX-ray binaries (LMXBs). Here it is described in more detail. The scenario takes\ninto account the interaction between superfluid inertial modes and the normal\n(quadrupole) $m=2$ $r$-mode, which can be driven unstable by\nChandrasekhar-Friedman-Schutz (CFS) mechanism. This interaction can only occur\nat some fixed \"resonance\" stellar temperatures; it leads to formation of the\n\"stability peaks\" which stabilize a star in the vicinity of these temperatures.\nWe demonstrate that a NS in LMXB spends a substantial fraction of time on the\nstability peak, that is, in the region of stellar temperatures and spin\nfrequencies, that has been previously thought to be CFS unstable with respect\nto excitation of $r$-modes. We also find that the spin frequencies of NSs are\nlimited by the CFS instability of normal (octupole) $m=3$ $r$-mode rather than\nby $m=2$ $r$-mode. This result agrees with the predicted value of the cutoff\nspin frequency $\\sim 730$ Hz in the spin distribution of accreting millisecond\nX-ray pulsars. In addition, we analyze evolution of a NS after the end of the\naccretion phase and demonstrate that millisecond pulsars can be born in LMXBs\nwithin our scenario. Besides millisecond pulsars, our scenario also predicts a\nnew class of LMXB descendants - hot and rapidly rotating nonaccreting NSs (\"hot\nwidows\"/HOFNARs). Further comparison of the proposed theory with observations\nof rotating NSs can impose new important constraints on the properties of\nsuperdense matter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 May 2013 14:47:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 27 Aug 2014 14:29:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

Starting from suitably subtracted\ndispersion representations, the form factors are constructed in an iterative\nway up to two loops in the low-energy expansion by implementing analyticity,\ncrossing, and unitarity due to two-meson intermediate states. Analytical\nexpressions for the phases of the two-loop form factors of the K\\pm -> pi^+\npi^- e^\\pm nu_e channel are given, allowing one to connect the difference of\nform-factor phase shifts measured experimentally (out of the isospin limit) and\nthe difference of S- and P-wave pi-pi phase shifts studied theoretically (in\nthe isospin limit). The isospin-breaking correction consists of the sum of a\nuniversal part, involving only pi-pi rescattering, and a process-dependent\ncontribution, involving the form factors in the coupled channels. The\ndependence on the two S-wave scattering lengths a_0^0 and a_0^2 in the isospin\nlimit is worked out in a general way, in contrast to previous analyses based on\none-loop chiral perturbation theory. The latter is used only to assess the\nsubtraction constants involved in the dispersive approach.

In order to describe the phenomena observed, it is necessary to\nincorporate both minimal and non-minimal couplings. The minimal coupling\nreflects the fact that the \\Delta+ is a charged particle, and in this model the\nminimal coupling contributes also to the M1 magnetic transition via the \\gamma\nN\\Delta vertex. The non-minimal couplings consist of five electromagnetic\nform-factors, which are accessed at fixed and vanishing momentum-transfer\nsquared with real photons in Compton scattering experiments, therefore it is\npossible to extract a rather well-determined set of optimal parameters which\nreasonably well fit the data in the resonance region 140-450 MeV. The crucial\nparameter which determines the \\gamma N\\Delta transition amplitude and\ntherefore the height of the resonance peak is equal to 3.66 +- 0.03, in units\nof \\mu_N.

In the low-energy\nregion up to 140 MeV, we separately fit the electric and magnetic\npolarizabilities, while keeping the other parameters fixed and obtain values in\nline with previous approaches. The basic model is then extended by\nincorporating the sigma-meson channel with the currently favored parameters,\nand the pion vertex corrections.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 May 2013 15:53:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-01"}
