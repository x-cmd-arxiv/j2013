Although the topology of a\nphysical system is practically hard to manipulate, recently it was shown that\nin certain topologically ordered phases, topological defects can introduce\nextra topological GSD. Here the topological defects can be viewed as\neffectively changing the topology of the physical system. Previous studies have\nbeen focusing on two spatial dimensions with point-like topological defects. In\nthree dimensions, line-like topological defects can appear. They are closed\nloops in the bulk that can be linked and knotted, effectively leading to\ncomplex three dimensional manifolds in certain topologically ordered states.\nThis paper studies the properties of such line-defects in a particular context:\nthe lattice dislocations. We give an analytical construction, together with\nsupport from exact numerical calculations, for the dependence of the GSD on\ndislocations of certain doubled versions of the exactly solvable Kitaev's toric\ncode models in both two and three dimensions. We find that the GSD of the 3d\nmodel depends only on the total number of dislocation loops, no matter how they\nare linked or knotted. The results are extended to Z_n generalizations of the\nmodel. Additionally, we consider the phases in which the crystalline orders are\ndestroyed through proliferation of double dislocations. The resulting phases\nare shown to host topological orders described by non-Abelian gauge theories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 May 2013 16:10:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-09"}

The clumps show, for the first time in a \"dense\ngas tracer\", a significant correlation between HCO+ line emission from cold\nmolecular gas and Br{\\gamma} line emission of associated nebulae. This\ncorrelation arises in the HCO+ line's brightness, not its linewidth. In\ncontrast, the correlation between the N2H+ line emission and Br{\\gamma} is weak\nor absent. The HCO+/N2H+ line ratio also varies widely from clump to clump:\nbright HCO+ emission tends to be more closely associated with Br{\\gamma}\nnebulosity, while bright N2H+ emission tends to avoid areas that are bright in\nBr{\\gamma}. Both molecular species show correlations of weak significance with\ninfrared H2 v=1-0 and v=2-1 line emission, in or near the clumps. The H2\nemission line ratio is consistent with fluorescent excitation in most of the\nclumps, although thermal excitation is seen in a few clumps. We interpret these\ntrends as evidence for evolution in the gas conditions due to the effects of\nongoing star formation in the clumps, in particular, the importance of UV\nradiation from massive YSOs as the driving agent that heats the molecular gas\nand alters its chemistry. This suggests that some traditional dense gas tracers\nof molecular clouds do not sample a homogeneous population of clumps, i.e.,\nthat the HCO+ brightness in particular is directly related to the heating and\ndisruption of cold gas by massive young stars, whereas the N2H+ better samples\ngas not yet affected by this process.

Spectral stacking is used to\ncharacterise how the average [OIII] profile changes as a function of these\nvariables.

It yields the rate of cosmic reheating and thereby determines the\ntemperature of the \"hot big bang\" in inflationary cosmology. The total rate\noriginates from various processes, including decays and inverse decays as well\nas Landau damping by scatterings. It involves quantum statistical effects and\noff-shell transport. Its temperature dependence can be highly nontrivial,\nmaking it impossible to express the reheating temperature in terms of the model\nparameters in a simple way. We pay special attention to the temperature\ndependence of the phase space due to the modified dispersion relations in the\nplasma. We find that it can have a drastic effect on the efficiency of\nperturbative reheating, which depends on the way particles in the primordial\nplasma interact. For some interactions thermal masses can effectively close the\nphase space for the dominant dissipative processes and thereby impose an upper\nbound on the reheating temperature.

Moreover, these backgrounds were shown to be sub-luminal\neverywhere in the space; in contrast to the common believe that these theories\nare necessarily superluminal in the vicinity of a static source. In this work\nwe complete that analysis by extending it to cover the whole parameter space of\nthese scalar-tensor theories. We find that the stability argument renders the\nasymptotically flat backgrounds unrealizable, forcing once again for\ncosmological asymptotics.

This anisotropic heat\nconduction profoundly changes the stability of the ICM atmosphere, with\nconvective stabilities being driven by temperature gradients of either sign.\nHere, we employ the Athena magnetohydrodynamic code to investigate the local\nnon-linear behavior of the heat-flux driven buoyancy instability (HBI),\nrelevant in the cores of cooling-core clusters where the temperature increases\nwith radius. We study a grid of 2-d simulations that span a large range of\ninitial magnetic field strengths and numerical resolutions. For very weak\ninitial fields, we recover the previously known result that the HBI wraps the\nfield in the horizontal direction thereby shutting off the heat flux. However,\nwe find that simulations which begin with intermediate initial field strengths\nhave a qualitatively different behavior, forming HBI-stable filaments that\nresist field-line wrapping and enable sustained vertical conductive heat flux\nat a level of 10--25% of the Spitzer value. While astrophysical conclusions\nregarding the role of conduction in cooling cores require detailed global\nmodels, our local study proves that systems dominated by HBI do not necessarily\nquench the conductive heat flux.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 May 2013 20:10:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

The performance of abundance-weighted phylogenetic diversity\nmeasures compared to classical discrete measures has not been explored, and the\nbehavior of these measures under rarefaction (sub-sampling) is not yet clear.\nIn this paper we compare the ability of various alpha diversity measures to\ndistinguish between different community states in the human microbiome for\nthree different data sets. We also present and compare a novel one-parameter\nfamily of alpha diversity measures, BWPD_\\theta, that interpolates between\nclassical phylogenetic diversity (PD) and an abundance-weighted extension of\nPD. Additionally, we examine the sensitivity of these phylogenetic diversity\nmeasures to sampling, via computational experiments and by deriving a closed\nform solution for the expectation of phylogenetic quadratic entropy under\nre-sampling. In all three of the datasets considered, an abundance-weighted\nmeasure is the best differentiator between community states. OTU-based\nmeasures, on the other hand, are less effective in distinguishing community\ntypes. In addition, abundance-weighted phylogenetic diversity measures are less\nsensitive to differing sampling intensity than their unweighted counterparts.\nBased on these results we encourage the use of abundance-weighted phylogenetic\ndiversity measures, especially for cases such as microbial ecology where\nspecies delimitation is difficult.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 May 2013 22:30:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-03"}

The primary result of this work explores how 10+ years of\nsimulated wear on a VIRUS fiber bundle affects both transmission and focal\nratio degradation (FRD) of the optical fibers. During the accelerated lifetime\ntests we continuously monitored the fibers for signs of FRD. We find that\ntransient FRD events were common during the portions of the tests when motion\nwas at telescope slew rates, but dropped to negligible levels during rates of\nmotion typical for science observation. Tests of fiber transmission and FRD\nconducted both before and after the lifetime tests reveal that while\ntransmission values do not change over the 10+ years of simulated wear, a clear\nincrease in FRD is seen in all 18 fibers tested. This increase in FRD is likely\ndue to microfractures that develop over time from repeated flexure of the fiber\nbundle, and stands in contrast to the transient FRD events that stem from\nlocalized stress and subsequent modal diffusion of light within the fibers.\nThere was no measurable wavelength dependence on the increase in FRD over 350\nnm to 600 nm. We also report on bend radius tests conducted on individual\nfibers and find the 266 microns VIRUS fibers to be immune to bending-induced\nFRD at bend radii of R > 10cm. Below this bend radius FRD increases slightly\nwith decreasing radius. Lastly, we give details of a degradation seen in the\nfiber bundle currently deployed on the Mitchell Spectrograph (formally VIRUS-P)\nat McDonald Observatory. The degradation is shown to be caused by a localized\nshear in a select number of optical fibers that leads to an explosive form of\nFRD.

However, there are solutions of Shape Dynamics that have no\ncounterpart in General relativity, just as there are solutions of GR that are\nnot completely foliable by global constant mean curvature slicings (such as the\nSchwarzschild spacetime). It is therefore interesting to analyze directly the\nequations of motion of Shape Dynamics in order to find its own solutions,\nirrespective of properties of known solutions of GR. Here I perform a first\nstudy in this direction by utilizing the equations of motion of Shape Dynamics\nin a spherically symmetric, asymptotically flat ansatz to derive an analogue of\nthe Birkhoff theorem. There are two significant differences with respect to the\nusual Birkhoff theorem in GR. The first regards the construction of the\nsolution: the spatial Weyl gauge freedom of shape dynamics is used to simplify\nthe problem, and boundary conditions are required. In fact the derivation is\nsimpler than the usual Birkhof theorem as no Christoffel symbols are needed.\nThe second, and most important difference is that the solution obtained is\nuniquely the isotropic wormhole solution, in which no singularity is present,\nas opposed to maximally extended Schwarzschild.

Fitting these models to observed\ndata is a difficult inference problem that has no straightforward solution. We\ntake a Bayesian approach to the inference of unknown parameters of a non-linear\nstate model; this, in turn, requires the availability of efficient Markov Chain\nMonte Carlo (MCMC) sampling methods for the latent (hidden) variables and model\nparameters. Using the ensemble technique of Neal (2010) and the embedded HMM\ntechnique of Neal (2003), we introduce a new Markov Chain Monte Carlo method\nfor non-linear state space models. The key idea is to perform parameter updates\nconditional on an enormously large ensemble of latent sequences, as opposed to\na single sequence, as with existing methods. We look at the performance of this\nensemble method when doing Bayesian inference in the Ricker model of population\ndynamics. We show that for this problem, the ensemble method is vastly more\nefficient than a simple Metropolis method, as well as 1.9 to 12.0 times more\nefficient than a single-sequence embedded HMM method, when all methods are\ntuned appropriately. We also introduce a way of speeding up the ensemble method\nby performing partial backward passes to discard poor proposals at low\ncomputational cost, resulting in a final efficiency gain of 3.4 to 20.4 times\nover the single-sequence method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 May 2013 01:01:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-03"}

If the hot component originates from a truly\ndiffuse interstellar plasma, not a collection of unresolved point sources, such\nplasma cannot be gravitationally bound, and its regeneration would require a\nhuge amount of energy.

By\nnumerically evolving gene regulatory networks, the proportionality between the\nphenotypic variances of epigenetic and genetic origins is confirmed. The former\nis given by the variance of the phenotypic fluctuation due to noise in the\ndevelopmental process; and the latter, by the variance of the phenotypic\nfluctuation due to genetic mutation. The relationship suggests a link between\nrobustness to noise and to mutation, since robustness can be defined by the\nsharpness of the distribution of the phenotype. Next, the proportionality\nbetween the variances is demonstrated to also hold over expressions of\ndifferent genes (phenotypic traits) when the system acquires robustness through\nthe evolution. Then, evolution under environmental variation is numerically\ninvestigated and it is found that both the adaptability to a novel environment\nand the robustness are made compatible when a certain degree of phenotypic\nfluctuations exists due to noise. The highest adaptability is achieved at a\ncertain noise level at which the gene expression dynamics are near the critical\nstate to lose the robustness.

The main component is the loop group, whose\nelements consist of pairs of cobordant loops. A Chas-Sullivan product is\ndescribed on the cobordism, and three other products, namely the 'vertical',\n'horizontal' and 'total' products are re-introduced. (They have already been\ndefined in an earlier paper by the author). A loop calculus is introduced on\nthe space of loops, consisting of the loop variation functional,the loop\nderivative, Mandelstam derivative, and what the author wishes to call, the\nGambini-Pullin contact functional. The loop derivative happens to be a\ngenerator of the group of loops, and the Gambini-Pullin functional is an\ninfinitesimal generator of diffeomorphisms. A toy model of gravity is\nformulated in terms of the above, and it is proven that the total product\nprovides for the Maurer-Cartan structure of the space. Further, new quantities\nlabeled as 'momenta', 'velocity' and 'energy' are introduced in terms of the\nloop products and loop derivatives. The prospect of re-constructing general\nrelativity in higher dimensions is explored, with the 'momenta' and 'velocity'\nbeing the basic loop variables. In the process, it is proven that the 'momenta'\nand 'velocity' behave as cobordant loops in higher dimensions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 May 2013 09:58:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-03"}

For heterogeneous\nnucleation at surfaces, the barrier is reduced by a factor depending on the\ncontact angle. Using the definition of \"physical\" clusters based on the\nFortuin-Kasteleyn mapping, the time-dependence of the cluster size distribution\nis studied for \"quenching experiments\" in the kinetic Ising model, and the\ncluster size $\\ell ^*$ where the cluster growth rate changes sign is estimated.\nThese studies of nucleation kinetics are compared to studies where the relation\nbetween cluster size and supersaturation is estimated from equilibrium\nsimulations of phase coexistence between droplet and vapor in the canonical\nensemble.

On the one\nhand, seminal papers by Almgren and Chriss introduced a decomposition between a\npermanent market impact and a temporary (or instantaneous) market impact. This\ndecomposition is used by most practitioners in execution models. On the other\nhand, recent research advocates for the use of a new modeling framework that\ngoes down to the resilient dynamics of order books: transient market impact.\nOne of the main criticisms against permanent market impact is that it has to be\nlinear to avoid dynamic arbitrage. This important discovery made by Huberman\nand Stanzl and Gatheral favors the transient market impact framework, as linear\npermanent market impact is at odds with reality.

The objective function is a generalized\nKullback-Leibler divergence, depending on both the unknown object and unknown\npoint spread function (PSF), without the addition of regularization terms;\nconstrained minimization, with suitable convex constraints on both unknowns, is\nconsidered. The problem is nonconvex and we propose to solve it by means of an\ninexact alternating minimization method, whose global convergence to stationary\npoints of the objective function has been recently proved in a general setting.\nThe method is iterative and each iteration, also called outer iteration,\nconsists of alternating an update of the object and the PSF by means of fixed\nnumbers of iterations, also called inner iterations, of the scaled gradient\nprojection (SGP) method. The use of SGP has two advantages: first, it allows to\nprove global convergence of the blind method; secondly, it allows the\nintroduction of different constraints on the object and the PSF. The specific\nconstraint on the PSF, besides non-negativity and normalization, is an upper\nbound derived from the so-called Strehl ratio, which is the ratio between the\npeak value of an aberrated versus a perfect wavefront. Therefore a typical\napplication is the imaging of modern telescopes equipped with adaptive optics\nsystems for partial correction of the aberrations due to atmospheric\nturbulence. In the paper we describe the algorithm and we recall the results\nleading to its convergence. Moreover we illustrate its effectiveness by means\nof numerical experiments whose results indicate that the method, pushed to\nconvergence, is very promising in the reconstruction of non-dense stellar\nclusters. The case of more complex astronomical targets is also considered, but\nin this case regularization by early stopping of the outer iterations is\nrequired.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 May 2013 12:54:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-25"}

Performing neutron diffraction, we monitored the quantity of ice\nformed during the sorption/desorption as a function of temperature down to 180\nK. Upon cooling, we observe that ice forms outside of the membrane and\ncrystallises in the hexagonal Ih form. Simultaneously, the membrane shrinks and\ndehydrate, leading to an increase of the hydronium ions concentration inside\nthe matrix. Reversibly, the ice melts and the membrane re-hydrate upon heating.\nA model of solution, whose freezing point varies with the hydronium\nconcentration, is proposed to calculate the quantity of ice formed as a\nfunction of temperature.

In this paper, we introduce an algorithm\ncalled PEACE (Pulsar Evaluation Algorithm for Candidate Extraction) which\nimproves the efficiency of identifying pulsar signals. The algorithm ranks the\ncandidates based on a score function. Unlike popular machine-learning based\nalgorithms, no prior training data sets are required. This algorithm has been\napplied to data from several large-scale radio pulsar surveys. Using the\nhuman-based ranking results generated by students in the Arecibo Remote Command\nenter programme, the statistical performance of PEACE was evaluated. It was\nfound that PEACE ranked 68% of the student-identified pulsars within the top\n0.17% of sorted candidates, 95% within the top 0.34%, and 100% within the top\n3.7%. This clearly demonstrates that PEACE significantly increases the pulsar\nidentification rate by a factor of about 50 to 1000. To date, PEACE has been\ndirectly responsible for the discovery of 47 new pulsars, 5 of which are\nmillisecond pulsars that may be useful for pulsar timing based\ngravitational-wave detection projects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 May 2013 14:42:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

The key idea is to use (a certain class of) string functions as\nnames representing these objects. These are more expressive than infinite\nsequences, which served as names in prior work that formulated complexity in\nmore restricted settings. An advantage of using string functions is that we can\ndefine their \"size\" in the way inspired by higher-type complexity theory. This\nenables us to talk about computation on string functions whose time or space is\nbounded polynomially in the input size, giving rise to more general analogues\nof the classes P, NP, and PSPACE. We also define NP- and PSPACE-completeness\nunder suitable many-one reductions.\n  Because our framework separates machine computation and semantics, it can be\napplied to problems on sets of interest in analysis once we specify a suitable\nrepresentation (encoding). As prototype applications, we consider the\ncomplexity of functions (operators) on real numbers, real sets, and real\nfunctions. For example, the task of numerical algorithms for solving a certain\nclass of differential equations is naturally viewed as an operator taking real\nfunctions to real functions. As there was no complexity theory for operators,\nprevious results only stated how complex the solution can be. We now\nreformulate them and show that the operator itself is polynomial-space\ncomplete.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 May 2013 14:47:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-03"}

In order to investigate both\nissues we have analysed the long term behaviour of the canonical sgB[e] star\nLHA 115-S 18. We employed the OGLE II-IV lightcurve to search for (a-)periodic\nvariability and supplemented these data with new and historic spectroscopy. In\ncontrast to historical expectations for sgB[e] stars, S18 is both\nphotometrically and spectroscopically highly variable. The lightcurve is\ncharacterised by rapid aperiodic `flaring' throughout the 16 years of\nobservations. Changes in the high excitation emission line component of the\nspectrum imply evolution in the stellar temperature - as expected for luminous\nblue variables - although somewhat surprisingly, spectroscopic and photometric\nvariability appears not to be correlated. Characterised by emission in low\nexcitation metallic species, the cool circumstellar torus appears largely\nunaffected by this behaviour. Finally, in conjunction with intense, highly\nvariable HeII emission, X-ray emission implies the presence of an unseen binary\ncompanion. S18 provides observational support for the putative physical\nassociation of (a subset of) sgB[e] stars and luminous blue variables. Given\nthe nature of the circumstellar environment of S18 and that luminous blue\nvariables have been suggested as SN progenitors, it is tempting to draw a\nparallel to the progenitors of SN1987A and the unusual transient SN2009ip.\nMoreover the likely binary nature of S18 strengthens the possibility that the\ndusty discs/tori that characterise sgB[e] stars are the result of binary-driven\nmass-loss; consequently such stars may provide a window on the short lived\nphase of mass-transfer in massive compact binaries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 May 2013 14:52:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

HAS comes with\ntwo unique flavors. First, by riding on top of HTTP/TCP, it leverages the\nnetwork-friendly TCP to achieve firewall/NATS traversal and bandwidth sharing.\nSecond, by pre-encoding and storing the video in a number of discrete bitrate\nlevels, it introduces video bitrate adaptivity in a scalable way that the video\nencoding is excluded from the closed-loop adaptation. A conventional wisdom is\nthat the TCP throughput observed by a HAS client indicates the available\nnetwork bandwidth, thus can be used as a reliable reference for the video\nbitrate selection.\n  We argue that this no longer holds true when HAS becomes a substantial\nfraction of the Internet traffic. We show that when multiple HAS clients\ncompete at a network bottleneck, the presence of competing clients and the\ndiscrete nature of the video bitrates would together create confusion for a\nclient to correctly perceive its fair-share bandwidth. Through analysis and\nreal experiments, we demonstrate that this fundamental limitation would lead\nto, for example, video rate oscillation that negatively impacts the video\nwatching experiences. We therefore argue that it is necessary to implement at\nthe application layer a \"probe-and-adapt\" mechanism for HAS video rate\nadaptation, which is akin but orthogonal to the transport-layer network rate\nadaptation achieved by TCP. We present PANDA -- a client-side rate adaptation\nalgorithm for HAS -- as an embodiment of this idea. Our testbed results show\nthat compared to conventional algorithms, PANDA is able to reduce the\ninstability of video rate by 60%, at a given risk of buffer underrun.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 May 2013 19:34:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 7 Jul 2013 23:48:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

Here\nthat analysis is extended and studied variations in the mean maximum sizes (the\nmean values of maximum areas) of the aforementioned three classes of sunspot\ngroups and also their combination. It is found that there is no significant\ncorrelation between the mean maximum size of any class of sunspot groups and\nthe International Sunspot Number (Rz), probably due to in a given time interval\nsmall sunspot groups/sunspots outnumber the large ones. A pattern of an\napproximate 9-year period cycle is seen in the variations of the mean maximum\nsizes of the large and the big sunspot groups during a solar cycle. On\nlong-time scales it is found that there exists a strong 130 or more years cycle\nin the variation of the mean size of the small sunspot groups, whereas there is\na hint on the existence of approximate 44-year cycles in the variations of the\nmean maximum sizes of the large and the big sunspot groups. During the decline\nphase of cycle 23, there was a scarcity in the very small sunspot groups\n(maximum area AM < or = 37 msh), which may be related to the slow growth of\nsunspot groups during this period. During the minimum between cycles 23 and 24\nmay be due to the presence of a number of small sunspot groups whose AM > 37\nmsh was larger than that of whose AM < or = 37 msh, the relatively large size\ncoronal holes were present at low-latitudes and the total solar irradiance was\nvery low.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 May 2013 08:29:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 14 Jun 2013 09:57:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 26 Jul 2013 11:06:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-29"}
