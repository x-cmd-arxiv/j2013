Generalizing earlier analysis for\naxisymmetric ellipsoidal particles (Parsa et al. 2012), we measure the\norientation statistics and rotation rates of general, triaxial ellipsoidal\ntracer particles using Lagrangian tracking in DNS of isotropic turbulence.\nTriaxial ellipsoids that are very long in one direction, very thin in another,\nand of intermediate size in the third direction exhibit reduced rotation rates\nthat are similar to those of rods in the ellipsoid's longest direction, while\nexhibiting increased rotation rates that are similar to those of axisymmetric\ndiscs in the thinnest direction.

They are also different from predictions of a\nGaussian process for the velocity gradient tensor, which does not provide\nrealistic preferred vorticity-strain-rate tensor alignments. DNS results are\nalso compared with a stochastic model for the velocity gradient tensor based on\nthe recent fluid deformation approximation (RFDA). Unlike the Gaussian model,\nthe stochastic model accurately predicts the reduction in rotation rate in the\nlongest direction of triaxial ellipsoids since this direction aligns with the\nflow's vorticity, with its rotation perpendicular to the vorticity being\nreduced. For disc-like particles, or in directions perpendicular to the longest\ndirection in triaxial particles, the model predicts {noticeably} smaller\nrotation rates than those observed in DNS, a behavior that can be understood\nbased on the probability of vorticity orientation with the most contracting\nstrain-rate eigen-direction in the model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 May 2013 17:10:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 29 Nov 2013 09:56:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-03"}

The gap's trough is darkened by both shadowing\nand cooling, relative to the uninterrupted disk. The gap's outer wall is\nbrightened by direct illumination and also by heating, which puffs it up so\nthat it intercepts more starlight. In this paper, we examine the effects of\ninclination on resolved images of disks with and without gaps at a wide range\nof wavelengths. The scattering surface's offset from the disk midplane creates\na brightness asymmetry along the axis of inclination, making the disk's near\nside appear brighter than the far side in scattered light. Finite disk\nthickness also causes the projected distances of equidistant points on the disk\nsurface to be smaller on the near side of the disk as compared to the far side.\nConsequently, the gap shoulder on the near side of the disk should appear\nbrighter and closer to the star than on the far side. However, if the angular\nresolution of the observation is coarser than the width of the brightened gap\nshoulder, then the gap shoulder on the far side may appear brighter because of\nits larger apparent size. We present a formula to recover the scale height and\ninclination angle of an imaged disk using simple geometric arguments and\nmeasuring disk asymmetries.

In particular, we argue\nthat the relative intensities for a number of observed excesses of emission\n(covering more than 11 orders of magnitude) can be explained by this model\nwithout any new fundamental parameters as all relative intensities for these\nemissions are determined by standard and well established physics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 May 2013 20:01:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Sep 2013 22:15:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-13"}

This reduces, under appropriate assumptions, the complexity of\ngenerating $N$ point `low energy' discretizations to order $N C_N^d$\ncomputations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 May 2013 22:33:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-29"}

In terms of modified laws\nof gravity and/or inertia, the MDA relation quantifies the transition from\nNewtonian to modified dynamics at low centripetal accelerations a_c < 10^-10\nm/s^2. As yet, neither dynamical models based on dark matter nor proposed\nmodifications of the laws of gravity/inertia have predicted the functional form\nof the MDA relation. In this work, I revisit the MDA data and compare them to\nfour different theoretical scaling laws. Three of these scaling laws are\nentirely empirical, the fourth one - the \"simple mu\" function of Modified\nNewtonian Dynamics - derives from a toy model of gravity based on massive\ngravitons (the \"graviton picture\"). All theoretical MDA relations comprise one\nfree parameter of the dimension of an acceleration, Milgrom's constant a_M. I\nfind that the \"simple mu\" function provides a good fit to the data free of\nnotable systematic residuals and provides the best fit among the four scaling\nlaws tested. The best-fit value of Milgrom's constant is a_M = (1.06 +/-\n0.05)*10^-10 m/s^2. Given the successful prediction of the functional form of\nthe MDA relation, plus an overall agreement with the observed kinematics of\nstellar systems spanning eight orders of magnitude in size and 14 orders of\nmagnitude in mass, I conclude that the \"graviton picture\" is sufficient (albeit\nprobably not a necessary or unique approach) to describe galactic dynamics on\nall scales well beyond the scale of the solar system. This suggests that, at\nleast on galactic scales, gravity behaves as if it was mediated by massive\nparticles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 May 2013 02:54:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

The NLSW is NLS perturbed by the wave\noperator with strength described by a dimensionless parameter\n$\\varepsilon\\in(0,1]$. As $\\varepsilon\\to0^+$, the NLSW converges to the NLS\nand for the small perturbation, i.e. $0<\\varepsilon\\ll1$, the solution of the\nNLSW differs from that of the NLS with a function oscillating in time with\n$O(\\varepsilon^2)$-wavelength at $O(\\varepsilon^2)$ and $O(\\varepsilon^4)$\namplitudes for ill-prepared and well-prepared initial data, respectively. This\nrapid oscillation in time brings significant difficulties in designing and\nanalyzing numerical methods with error bounds uniformly in $\\varepsilon$.

We present an unprecedentedly detailed analysis of the\ncolumn density structure of a high-mass, filamentary molecular cloud, namely\nIRDC G11.11-0.12 (G11). We use two novel column density mapping techniques:\nhigh-resolution (FWHM=2\", or ~0.035 pc) dust extinction mapping in near- and\nmid-infrared, and dust emission mapping with the Herschel satellite. These two\ncompletely independent techniques yield a strikingly good agreement,\nhighlighting their complementarity and robustness. We first analyze the dense\ngas mass fraction and linear mass density of G11. We show that G11 has a top\nheavy mass distribution and has a linear mass density (M_l ~ 600 Msun pc^{-1})\nthat greatly exceeds the critical value of a self-gravitating, non-turbulent\ncylinder. These properties make G11 analogous to the Orion A cloud, despite its\nlow star-forming activity. This suggests that the amount of dense gas in\nmolecular clouds is more closely connected to environmental parameters or\nglobal processes than to the star-forming efficiency of the cloud. We then\nexamine hierarchical fragmentation in G11 over a wide range of size-scales and\ndensities. We show that at scales 0.5 pc > l > 8 pc, the fragmentation of G11\nis in agreement with that of a self-gravitating cylinder. At scales smaller\nthan l < 0.5 pc, the results agree better with spherical Jeans' fragmentation.\nOne possible explanation for the change in fragmentation characteristics is the\nsize-scale-dependent collapse time-scale that results from the finite size of\nreal molecular clouds: at scales l < 0.5 pc, fragmentation becomes sufficiently\nrapid to be unaffected by global instabilities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 May 2013 07:06:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

The\nHerschel Space Observatory opened up the terahertz regime to such surveys,\ngiving access to the fundamental transitions of many hydrides and to the\nhigh-energy transitions of many other species. A comparative analysis of the\nchemical inventories and physical processes and properties of protostars of\nvarious masses and evolutionary states is the goal of the Herschel CHEmical\nSurveys of Star forming regions (CHESS) key program. This paper focusses on the\nintermediate-mass protostar, OMC-2 FIR 4. We obtained a spectrum of OMC-2 FIR 4\nin the 480 to 1902 GHz range with the HIFI spectrometer onboard Herschel and\ncarried out the reduction, line identification, and a broad analysis of the\nline profile components, excitation, and cooling. We detect 719 spectral lines\nfrom 40 species and isotopologs. The line flux is dominated by CO, H2O, and\nCH3OH. The line profiles are complex and vary with species and upper level\nenergy, but clearly contain signatures from quiescent gas, a broad component\nlikely due to an outflow, and a foreground cloud. We find abundant evidence for\nwarm, dense gas, as well as for an outflow in the field of view. Line flux\nrepresents 2% of the 7 L_Sol luminosity detected with HIFI in the 480 to 1250\nGHz range. Of the total line flux, 60% is from CO, 13% from H2O and 9% from\nCH3OH. A comparison with similar HIFI spectra of other sources is set to\nprovide much new insight into star formation regions, a case in point being a\ndifference of two orders of magnitude in the relative contribution of sulphur\noxides to the line cooling of Orion KL and OMC-2 FIR 4.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 May 2013 09:17:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

Solar-based technologies could provide\nsufficient energy to satisfy the global economic demands in the near future.\nPhotovoltaic (PV) cells are the most promising man-made devices for direct\nsolar energy utilization. Understanding the charge separation and charge\ntransport in PV materials at a molecular level is crucial for improving the\nefficiency of the solar cells. Here, we use light-induced EPR spectroscopy\ncombined with DFT calculations to study the electronic structure of charge\nseparated states in blends of polymers (P3HT, PCDTBT, and PTB7) and fullerene\nderivatives (C60-PCBM and C70-PCBM). Solar cells made with the same composites\nas active layers show power conversion efficiencies of 3.3% (P3HT), 6.1%\n(PCDTBT), and 7.3% (PTB7), respectively. Under illumination of these\ncomposites, two paramagnetic species are formed due to photo-induced electron\ntransfer between the conjugated polymer and the fullerene. They are the\npositive, P+, and negative, P-, polarons on the polymer backbone and fullerene\ncage, respectively, and correspond to radical cations and radical anions. Using\nthe high spectral resolution of high-frequency EPR (130 GHz), the EPR spectra\nof these species were resolved and principal components of the g-tensors were\nassigned. Light-induced pulsed ENDOR spectroscopy allowed the determination of\n1H hyperfine coupling constants of photogenerated positive and negative\npolarons. The experimental results obtained for the different polymer-fullerene\ncomposites have been compared with DFT calculations, revealing that in all\nthree systems the positive polaron is distributed over distances of 40-60 A on\nthe polymer chain. This corresponds to about 15 thiophene units for P3HT,\napproximately three units PCDTBT, and about three to four units for PTB7.

The elliptic flow of thermal photons from ideal hydrodynamics\nconsidering a smooth initial density distribution under-predicts the PHENIX\ndirect photon data from 200A GeV Au+Au collisions at RHIC by a large margin in\nthe range $1 < p_T < 5$ GeV/$c$.

The focus of many\noutflow studies is the correlation between the outflow force, bolometric\nluminosity and envelope mass. However, it is difficult to combine the results\nof different studies in large evolutionary plots over many orders of magnitude\ndue to the range of data quality, analysis methods and corrections for\nobservational effects such as opacity and inclination. We aim to determine the\noutflow force for a sample of low luminosity embedded sources. We will quantify\nthe influence of the analysis method and the assumptions entering the\ncalculation of the outflow force. We use the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope to\nmap 12CO J=3-2 over 2'x2' regions around 16 Class I sources of a well-defined\nsample in Ophiuchus at 15\" resolution. The outflow force is then calculated\nusing seven different methods differing e.g. in the use of intensity-weighted\nemission and correction factors for inclination. The results from the analysis\nmethods differ from each other by up to a factor of 6, whereas observational\nproperties and choices in the analysis procedure affect the outflow force by up\nto a factor of 4. For the sample of Class I objects, bipolar outflows are\ndetected around 13 sources including 5 new detections, where the three\nnon-detections are confused by nearby outflows from other sources. When\ncombining outflow forces from different studies, a scatter by up to a factor of\n5 can be expected. Although the true outflow force remains unknown, the\nseparation method (separate calculation of dynamical time and momentum) is\nleast affected by the uncertain observational parameters. The correlations\nbetween outflow force, bolometric luminosity and envelope mass are further\nconfirmed down to low luminosity sources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 May 2013 11:27:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

In practice, various instrumental perturbations can degrade the\nnulling performance. Any imperfection in phase, amplitude, or polarization\nproduces a spurious flux that leaks to the interferometer output and corrupts\nthe transmitted off-axis flux. One of these instrumental pertubations is the\ncrosstalk phenomenon, which occurs because of multiple parasitic reflections\ninside transmitting optics, and/or diffraction effects related to beam\npropagation along finite size optics. It can include a crosstalk of a beam with\nitself, and a mutual crosstalk between different beams. This can create a\nparasitic interference pattern, which degrades the intrinsic transmission map -\nor intensity response - of the interferometer. In this context, we describe how\nthis instrumental effect impairs the performance of a Bracewell interferometer.\nA simple formalism is developed to derive the corresponding modified intensity\nresponse of the interferometer, as a function of the two parameters of\ninterest: the crosstalk level (or contamination rate) and the phase shift\nbetween the primary and secondary - parasitic - beams. We then apply our\nmathematical approach to a few scientific cases, both analytically and using\nthe GENIEsim simulation software, adapted to handle coherent crosstalk. Our\nresults show that a coherent crosstalk level of about 1% implies a 20% drop of\nthe SNR at most. Careful attention should thus be paid to reduce the crosstalk\nlevel inside an interferometric instrument and ensure an instrumental stability\nthat provides the necessary sensitivity through calibration procedures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 May 2013 11:49:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-29"}

For instance, they do not know or take into account how long a\ntask will take to execute or how many subtasks it will spawn. Moreover, the\nactual task execution order is typically determined by the underlying task\nstorage data structure, and cannot be changed. There are thus possibilities for\noptimizing task parallel executions by providing information on specific tasks\nand their preferred execution order to the scheduling system.\n  We introduce scheduling strategies to enable applications to dynamically\nprovide hints to the task-scheduling system on the nature of specific tasks.\nScheduling strategies can be used to independently control both local task\nexecution order as well as steal order. In contrast to conventional scheduling\npolicies that are normally global in scope, strategies allow the scheduler to\napply optimizations on individual tasks. This flexibility greatly improves\ncomposability as it allows the scheduler to apply different, specific\nscheduling choices for different parts of applications simultaneously. We\npresent a number of benchmarks that highlight diverse, beneficial effects that\ncan be achieved with scheduling strategies. Some benchmarks (branch-and-bound,\nsingle-source shortest path) show that prioritization of tasks can reduce the\ntotal amount of work compared to standard work-stealing execution order. For\nother benchmarks (triangle strip generation) qualitatively better results can\nbe achieved in shorter time. Other optimizations, such as dynamic merging of\ntasks or stealing of half the work, instead of half the tasks, are also shown\nto improve performance. Composability is demonstrated by examples that combine\ndifferent strategies, both within the same kernel (prefix sum) as well as when\nscheduling multiple kernels (prefix sum and unbalanced tree search).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 May 2013 12:59:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-29"}

In the rare mutations asymptotic, mutations arise as the image of a\nPoisson process by the ladder height process of a L\\'evy process with infinite\nvariation, and in the particular case of the critical branching process with\nexponential lifetimes, the limiting object is the Poisson point process of the\ndepths of excursions of the Brownian motion, with Poissonian mutations on the\nlineages.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 May 2013 13:51:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-29"}

The dense core\nexhibits an overall velocity gradient in a Keplerian-like pattern, which breaks\nat the center of the core where SMA 6 and SMA 7 are located. The dust\npolarization shows a complex magnetic field, compatible with a toroidal\nconfiguration. This is in contrast with the large, parsec-scale filament that\nsurrounds the core, where there is a smooth magnetic field. The total magnetic\nfield strengths in the filament and in the core are 0.9 and 2.1 mG,\nrespectively. We found evidence of magnetic field diffusion at the core scales,\nfar beyond the expected value for ambipolar diffusion. It is possible that the\ndiffusion arises from fast magnetic reconnection in the presence of turbulence.\nThe dynamics of the DR 21(OH) core appear to be controlled energetically in\nequal parts by the magnetic field, magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence and\nthe angular momentum. The effect of the angular momentum (this is a fast\nrotating core) is probably causing the observed toroidal field configuration.\nYet, gravitation overwhelms all the forces, making this a clear supercritical\ncore with a mass-to-flux ratio of ~6 times the critical value. However,\nsimulations show that this is not enough for the high level of fragmentation\nobserved at 1000 AU scales. Thus, rotation and outflow feedback is probably the\nmain cause of the observed fragmentation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 May 2013 14:20:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 12 Jun 2013 08:43:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

It affects\nsystems close to the critical (cusp overflowing) configuration. The runaway\neffect depends on the radial profile l(R) of the angular momentum distribution\nof the fluid, on the dimension-less spin a of the central black hole, and other\nfactors, such as self-gravity. Previously it was demonstrated that, for the\npower-law dependence of the radial angular momentum profile, non-magnetized\ntori always become runaway stable for a sufficiently high positive value of q.\nHere we discuss the role of runaway instability within a framework of an\naxially symmetric model of perfect fluid endowed with a purely toroidal\nmagnetic field. The gradual accretion of material over the cusp transfers the\nmass and angular momentum into the black hole, thereby changing the intrinsic\nparameters of the Kerr metric. We studied the effect of the ratio of gas to\nmagnetic pressure and other parameters of the model on the evolution of\ncritical configurations that are just on the verge of cusp overflow. We show\nthat the toroidal magnetic component inside an accretion torus does not change\nthe frequency of its oscillations significantly. We identify these oscillations\nas the radial epicyclic mode. These weak effects can trigger the runaway\ninstability even in situations when the purely hydrodynamical regime of the\ntorus is stable. On the other hand, in most cases the stable configuration\nremains unaffected, and the initial deviations gradually decay after several\norbital periods. We show examples of the torus evolution depending on the\ninitial magnetization beta, the slope q, and the spin a. The toroidal magnetic\nfield plays a more important role in the early phases of the accretion process\nuntil the perturbed configuration finds a new equilibrium or disappears because\nof the runaway instability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 May 2013 14:39:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-28"}

We calculate the reduced density matrix and\nthe entanglement entropy for a leg of the ladder (i.e. cut made between the\nchains). In the fermionic system we find the exact form of the reduced density\nmatrix for one of the chains and determine the entanglement spectrum\nexplicitly. Here we find that in the weak tunneling limit of the ladder the\nentanglement entropy of one chain of the gapped ladder has a simple and\nuniversal form dictated by conformal invariance. In the case of the spin\nsystem, we consider the strong coupling limit by using perturbation theory and\nget the reduced density matrix by the Schmidt decomposition. The entanglement\nentropies of a general gapped system of two coupled conformal field theories\n(in 1+1 dimensions) is discussed using the replica trick and scaling arguments.\nWe show that 1) for a system with a bulk gap the reduced density matrix has the\nform of a thermal density matrix, 2) the long-wavelength modes of one subsystem\n(a chain) of a gapped coupled system are always thermal, 3) the von Neumann\nentropy equals to the thermodynamic entropy of one chain, and 4) the bulk gap\nplays the role of effective temperature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 May 2013 15:43:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Jul 2013 21:11:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-28"}

The model is simple enough to\nbe amenable not only to numerics but also to analysis, yet sophisticated enough\nto reproduce hexagonally packed structures that resemble the cylinder patterns\nobserved in block copolymer experiments.\n  Starting from a sharp-interface continuum model, a nonlocal energy functional\ninvolving a Wasserstein cost, we derive the new model using Gamma-convergence\nin a limit where the volume fraction of one phase tends to zero. The limit\nenergy is defined on atomic measures; in three dimensions the atoms represent\nsmall spherical blobs of the minority phase, in two dimensions they represent\nthin cylinders of the minority phase.\n  We then study minimisers of the limit energy. Numerical minimisation is\nperformed in two dimensions by recasting the problem as a computational\ngeometry problem involving power diagrams. The numerical results suggest that\nthe small particles of the minority phase tend to arrange themselves on a\ntriangular lattice as the number of particles goes to infinity. This is proved\nin the companion paper Bourne, Peletier & Theil and agrees with patterns\nobserved in block copolymer experiments.
