Real-life\nsoftware optimisation however lies in optimising at the same time speed and\nmemory usage as well as keeping code simple. This paper first presents some\nthoughts on the available algorithms in terms of memory usage leading to a very\nsimple scan-line-based algorithm aiming at answering that challenge. Although\nsub-optimal in terms of speed it is optimal if both speed and memory space are\ntaken together and is very easy to implement.

Coupled with an estimate of the radius of the broad line\nregion this yields M_BH. The radius of the broad line region (BLR) may be\ninferred from an extrapolation of the correlation between source luminosity and\nreverberation derived r_BLR measures (the so-called Kaspi relation involving\nabout 60 low z sources). We are exploring a different method for estimating\nr_BLR directly from inferred physical conditions in the BLR of each source. We\nreport here on a comparison of r_BLR estimates that come from our method and\nfrom reverberation mapping. Our \"photoionization\" method employs diagnostic\nline intensity ratios in the rest-frame range 1400-2000 A\n(AlIII1860/SiIII]1892, CIV1549/AlIII1860) that enable derivation of the product\nof density and ionization parameter with the BLR distance derived from the\ndefinition of the ionization parameter.

We suggest empirical corrections to improve the\nagreement between individual photoionization-derived r_BLR values and those\nobtained from reverberation mapping. The results in this paper can be exploited\nto estimate M_BH for large samples of high-z quasars using an appropriate\nvirial broadening estimator. We show that the width of the UV intermediate\nemission lines are consistent with the width of H beta, therefore providing a\nreliable virial broadening estimator that can be measured in large samples of\nhigh-z quasars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 May 2013 16:41:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

The model is usually considered as degenerate, given that the\nnumber of free parameters is higher than the number of observables. It is thus\ncommon to model the SED by choosing a single set of values for the SSC-model\nparameters that provide a good description of the data, without studying the\nentire parameter space. We present here a new numerical algorithm which permits\nus to find the complete set of solutions, using the information coming from the\ndetection in the GeV and TeV energy bands. The algorithm is composed of three\nseparate steps: we first prepare a grid of simulated SEDs and extract from each\nSED the values of the observables; we then parametrize each observable as a\nfunction of the SSC parameters; we finally solve the system for a given set of\nobservables.

In\norbit around these black holes are a centrally-concentrated distribution of\nstars, both in single and in binary systems. Occasionally, these stars are\nperturbed onto orbits that bring them close to the SMBH. If the star is in a\nbinary system, the three-body interaction with the SMBH can lead to large\nchanges in orbital energy, depositing one of the two stars on a tightly-bound\norbit, and its companion into a hyperbolic orbit that may escape the galaxy. In\nthis Letter, we show that the disruption of solitary stars can also lead to\nlarge positive increases in orbital energy. The kick velocity depends on the\namount of mass the star loses at pericenter, but not on the ratio of black hole\nto stellar mass, and are at most the star's own escape velocity. We find that\nthese kicks are usually too small to result in the ejection of stars from the\nMilky Way, but can eject the stars from the black hole's sphere of influence,\nreducing their probability of being disrupted again.

We interpret these data with a model of circular rotation in\na flat disk. The PM and LOS data paint a consistent picture of the LMC rotation\nand their combination yields several new insights. The PM data imply a stellar\ndynamical center that coincides with the HI dynamical center, and a rotation\ncurve amplitude consistent with that inferred from LOS velocity studies. The\nimplied disk viewing angles agree with the range of values found in the\nliterature, but continue to indicate variations with stellar population and/or\nradius. Young (RSG) stars rotate faster than old (RGB/AGB) stars due to\nasymmetric drift. Outside the central region, the circular velocity is\napproximately flat at Vcirc = 91.7 +/- 18.8 km/s.

A tight correlation between\nmetallicity and [alpha/Fe] versus age is clearly identifiable on thick disk\nstars, implying that this population formed from a well mixed ISM, over a time\nscale of 4-5 Gyr. Thick disk stars vertical velocity dispersion correlate with\nage, with the youngest objects having as small scale heights as those of thin\ndisk stars. A natural consequence of these two results is that a vertical\nmetallicity gradient is expected in this population. We suggest that the thick\ndisk set the initial conditions for the formation of the inner thin disk. This\nprovides also an explanation of the apparent coincidence between the step in\nmetallicity at 7-10 kpc in the thin disk and the confinment of the thick disk\nat about R<10 kpc. We suggest that the outer thin disk developped outside the\ninfluence of the thick disk, but also that the high alpha-enrichment of the\nouter regions may originate from a primordial pollution by the gas expelled\nfrom the thick disk. Local metal-poor thin disk stars, whose properties are\nbest explained by an origin in the outer disk, are shown to be as old as the\nyoungest thick disk (9-10 Gyr), implying that the outer thin disk started to\nform while the thick disk formation was still on-going in the inner Galaxy.

The observable value as a function of the\nfield constitutes a quantum control landscape. Previous works have shown, under\nspecified conditions, that the quantum control landscape should be free of\nsuboptimal critical points. This favorable landscape topology is one factor\ncontributing to the efficiency of climbing the landscape. An additional,\ncomplementary factor is the landscape \\textit{structure}, which constitutes all\nnon-topological features. If the landscape's structure is too complex, then\nclimbs may be forced to take inefficient convoluted routes to finding optimal\ncontrols. This paper provides a foundation for understanding control landscape\nstructure by examining the linearity of gradient-based optimization\ntrajectories through the space of control fields. For this assessment, a metric\n$R\\geq 1$ is defined as the ratio of the path length of the optimization\ntrajectory to the Euclidean distance between the initial control field and the\nresultant optimal control field that takes an observable from the bottom to the\ntop of the landscape. Computational analyses for simple model quantum systems\nare performed to ascertain the relative abundance of nearly straight control\ntrajectories encountered when optimizing a state-to-state transition\nprobability. The collected results indicate that quantum control landscapes\nhave very simple structural features. The favorable topology and the\ncomplementary simple structure of the control landscape provide a basis for\nunderstanding the generally observed ease of optimizing a state-to-state\ntransition probability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 May 2013 22:57:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-20"}

The influence of the leader's connectivity in the\nnetwork, his toughness or tolerance and his opinion on the opinion dynamics is\nstudied as a function of the initial opinion uncertainty (tolerance) of the\npopulation. Numerical results obtained with leaders at low, high and average\ntolerance show complex bifurcation patterns of the group opinion; a decrease or\neven the total lost of control of the leader over the society is observed in\ndifferent intervals of tolerance of agents in the case of C/PA-societies. We\nfound that in the C-society a leader showing high opinion tolerance has more\ncontrol over the population. In the PA-society a leader changes the bifurcation\npattern of group opinion in a drastic and unexpected way, contrary to the\ncommon sense, and generates stronger polarization in the opposite opinion\ngroups; the connectivity of the leader is an important factor that usually\nimproves the adhesion of agents to the leader's opinion.

Large transmitted powers suggest\nmaximizing power efficiency (ratio of information rate to average signal power)\nas opposed to restricting bandwidth. The fundamental limit to reliable\ncommunication is determined, and is not affected by carrier frequency,\ndispersion, scattering, or motion. The available efficiency is limited by noise\nalone, and the available information rate is limited by noise and available\naverage power. A set of five design principles (well within our own\ntechnological capability) can asymptotically approach the fundamental limit; no\nother civilization can achieve greater efficiency. Bandwidth can be expanded in\na way that avoids invoking impairment by dispersion or scattering. The\nresulting power-efficient signals have characteristics very different from\ncurrent SETI targets, with wide bandwidth relative to the information rate and\na sparse distribution of energy in both time and frequency. Information-free\nbeacons achieving the lowest average power consistent with a given receiver\nobservation time are studied. They need not have wide bandwidth, but do\ndistribute energy more sparsely in time as average power is reduced. The\ndiscovery of both beacons and information-bearing signals is analyzed, and most\nclosely resembles approaches that have been employed in optical SETI. No\nprocessing is needed to account for impairments other than noise. A direct\nstatistical tradeoff between a larger number of observations and a lower\naverage power (including due to lower information rate) is established. The\n\"false alarms\" in current searches are characteristic signatures of these\nsignals.

Such scaling is consistent with the Kibble-Zurek\nmechanism (KZM). By contrast, distribution of individual vortices with randomly\nassigned topological charges would result in the dispersion of W scaling with\nthe square root of the area inside C. Scaling of the dispersion of W and of the\nprobability of detection of non-zero W with C can be also studied for loops so\nsmall that non-zero windings are rare. In this case I show a doubling of the\nscaling of dispersion with C when compared to the scaling of dispersion in the\nlarge W regime.

Investigation of the spatial distribution of oscillation power in the\nfrequency range 1-8 mHz for the different height levels of the solar\natmosphere. Measuring the time lags between the oscillations at the different\nlayers.\n  Methods. We used frequency filtration of the intensity and Doppler velocity\nvariations with Morlet wavelet to trace the wave propagation from the\nphotosphere to the chromosphere and the corona.\n  Results. The 15 min oscillations are concentrated near the outer penumbra in\nthe upper photosphere (1700 A), forming a ring, that expands in the transition\nzone. These oscillations propagate upward and reach the corona level, where\ntheir spatial distribution resembles a fan structure. The spatial distribution\nof the 5 min oscillation power looks like a circle-shape structure matching the\nsunspot umbra border at the photospheric level. The circle expands at the\nhigher levels (HeII 304A and FeIX 171A). This indicates that the low-frequency\noscillations propagate along the inclined magnetic tubes in the spot. We found\nthat the inclination of the tubes reaches 50--60 degrees in the upper\nchromosphere and the transition zone.

As an illustration, the explicit secular equation is\nobtained for surface waves in incompressible monoclinic materials with the\nsymmetry plane at x_3=0. This equation also covers the case of incompressible\northotropic materials.\n  The displacements and stresses for surface waves are often expressed in terms\nof the elastic stiffnesses, which can be unbounded in the incompressible limit.\nAn alternative formalism in terms of the elastic compliances presented recently\nby Ting is employed so that surface wave solutions in the incompressible limit\ncan be obtained.

As many approaches were\nproposed to increase the performance of a wireless sensor network among them\nclustering is one of the efficient approaches in sensor network. Many\nclustering algorithms concentrate mainly on power Optimization like FSCH,\nLEACH, and EELBCRP. There is necessity of the above metrics in wireless sensor\nnetwork where nodes are densely deployed in a given network area. As the nodes\nare deployed densely there is maximum possibility of nodes appear in the\nsensing region of other nodes. So there exists an option that nodes have to\nsend the information that is already reached the base station by its own\ncluster members or by members of other clusters. This mechanism will affect the\nQoI, Energy factor and congestion control of the wireless sensor networks. Even\nthough clustering uses TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access) for avoiding\ncongestion control for intra clustering data transmission, but it may fail in\nsome critical situation.

All lower bounds so far have made strong restrictions on the\ncomputational model. One of the most well known results, by Morgenstern from\n1973, provides an $\\Omega(n \\log n)$ lower bound for the \\emph{unnormalized}\nFFT when the constants used in the computation are bounded. The proof uses a\npotential function related to a determinant. The determinant of the\nunnormalized Fourier transform is $n^{n/2}$, and thus by showing that it can\ngrow by at most a constant factor after each step yields the result.\n  This classic result, however, does not explain why the \\emph{normalized}\nFourier transform, which has a unit determinant, should take $\\Omega(n\\log n)$\nsteps to compute. In this work we show that in a layered linear circuit model\nrestricted to unitary $2\\times 2$ gates, one obtains an $\\Omega(n\\log n)$ lower\nbound. The well known FFT works in this model.

It is these labels that are then used for downstream\nanalysis (either focusing on individual clusters, or identifying\nrepresentatives of clusters and so on). Thus, in order to trust a clustering as\na first step in exploratory data analysis, we must trust the labels assigned to\nindividual data. Without supervision, how can we validate this assignment? In\nthis paper, we present a method to attach affinity scores to the implicit\nlabels of individual points in a clustering. The affinity scores capture the\nconfidence level of the cluster that claims to \"own\" the point. This method is\nvery general: it can be used with clusterings derived from Euclidean data,\nkernelized data, or even data derived from information spaces. It smoothly\nincorporates importance functions on clusters, allowing us to eight different\nclusters differently. It is also efficient: assigning an affinity score to a\npoint depends only polynomially on the number of clusters and is independent of\nthe number of points in the data. The dimensionality of the underlying space\nonly appears in preprocessing. We demonstrate the value of our approach with an\nexperimental study that illustrates the use of these scores in different data\nanalysis tasks, as well as the efficiency and flexibility of the method.

The associated eigenmodes of this\nlinearised problem are the normal velocity and the normal vorticity eigenmodes,\nwhich are not dimensionally homogeneous quantities. Thus non-orthogonality\ncondition between these two families of eigenmodes have not been clearly\ndemonstrated yet. Using an orthogonal decomposition of solenoidal velocity\nfields, a velocity perturbation is expressed as an L2 orthogonal sum of an\nOrrSommerfeld velocity field (function of the perturbation normal velocity) and\na Squirevelocity field (function of the perturbation normal vorticity). Using\nthis decomposition,a variational formulation of the linearised problem is\nwritten, that is equivalent to the Orr Sommerfeld and Squire equations, but\nwhose eigenmodes consist of two families of velocity eigenmodes (thus\ndimensionally homogeneous).

These librations have previously been studied\nfor a planet with two layers: a mantle and a liquid core. Here, we calculate\nhow the presence of a solid inner core in the liquid outer core influences the\nlong-period forced librations. Mantle-inner core coupling affects the\nlong-period libration dynamics mainly by changing the free libration: first, it\nlengthens the period of the free libration of the mantle, and second, it adds a\nsecond free libration, closely related to the free gravitational oscillation\nbetween the mantle and inner core. The two free librations have periods between\n2.5 and 18 y depending on the internal structure. We show that large amplitude\nlong-period librations of 10's of arcsec are generated when the period of a\nplanetary forcing approaches one of the two free libration periods. These\namplitudes are sufficiently large to be detectable by spacecraft measurements\nof the libration of Mercury.

These\nmodels extend spatially the static stability models adopted in geotechnical\nengineering, and adopt an infinite-slope geometry to balance the resisting and\nthe driving forces acting on the sliding mass. An infiltration model is used to\ndetermine how rainfall changes pore-water conditions, modulating the local\nstability/instability conditions. A problem with the operation of the existing\nmodels lays in the difficulty in obtaining accurate values for the several\nvariables that describe the material properties of the slopes. The problem is\nparticularly severe when the models are applied over large areas, for which\nsufficient information on the geotechnical and hydrological conditions of the\nslopes is not generally available. To help solve the problem, we propose a\nprobabilistic Monte Carlo approach to the distributed modeling of\nrainfall-induced shallow landslides. For the purpose, we have modified the\nTransient Rainfall Infiltration and Grid-Based Regional Slope-Stability\nAnalysis (TRIGRS) code. The new code (TRIGRS-P) adopts a probabilistic approach\nto compute, on a cell-by-cell basis, transient pore-pressure changes and\nrelated changes in the factor of safety due to rainfall infiltration.\nInfiltration is modeled using analytical solutions of partial differential\nequations describing one-dimensional vertical flow in isotropic, homogeneous\nmaterials. Both saturated and unsaturated soil conditions can be considered.\nTRIGRS-P copes with the natural variability inherent to the mechanical and\nhydrological properties of the slope materials by allowing values of the TRIGRS\nmodel input parameters to be sampled randomly from a given probability\ndistribution.

Besides the well-known charge and spin currents\nwe show that a non-zero spin-quadrupole current flows between the ferromagnets.\nThis tensor-valued current describes the non-equilibrium transport of\nspin-anisotropy relating to both local and non-local multi-particle spin\ncorrelations of the circuit. This quadratic spin-anisotropy, quantified in\nterms of the spin-quadrupole moment, is fundamentally a two-electron quantity.\nIn spin-valves with an embedded quantum dot such currents have been shown to\nresult in a quadrupole accumulation that affects the measurable quantum dot\nspin and charge dynamics. The spin-valve model studied here allows fundamental\nquestions about spin-quadrupole storage and transport to be worked out in\ndetail, while ignoring the detection by a quantum dot. This physical\nunderstanding of this particular device is of importance for more complex\ndevices where spin-quadrupole transport can be detected. We demonstrate that,\nas far as storage and transport are concerned, the spin anisotropy is only\npartly determined by the spin polarization. In fact, for a thermally biased\nspin-valve the charge- and spin-current may vanish, while a pure exchange\nspin-quadrupole current remains, which appears as a fundamental consequence of\nPauli's principle. We extend the real-time diagrammatic approach to efficiently\ncalculate the average of multi-particle spin-observables, in particular the\nspin-quadrupole current. Although the paper addresses only leading order and\nspin-conserving tunneling we formulate the technique for arbitrary order in an\narbitrary, spin-dependent tunnel coupling in a way that lends itself to\nextension to quantum-dot spin-valve structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 May 2013 15:02:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-18"}

The simulated data\nagree overall with the observed SP signals and allow decomposing the different\nsignal contributions to analyze them separately. By reviewing other published\nexperimental data, we suggest that most of them include electrode effects that\nhave not been properly taken into account. Our results suggest that previously\npresented SP theory works well when considering the modeling uncertainties\npresently associated with electrode effects.

In order to allow the absolute\nluminosity (or upper limit) of the companion object to be properly calibrated,\nwe undertook astrometric observations with the Very Long Baseline Array to\nconstrain the system distance via a measurement of annual geometric parallax.\nWith these observations, we measure the parallax of the J2222-0137 system to be\n3.742 +0.013 -0.016 milliarcseconds, yielding a distance of 267.3 +1.2 -0.9 pc,\nand measure the transverse velocity to be 57.1 +0.3 -0.2 km/s. Fixing these\nparameters in the pulsar timing model made it possible to obtain a measurement\nof Shapiro delay and hence the system inclination, which shows that the system\nis nearly edge-on (sin i = 0.9985 +/- 0.0005). Furthermore, we were able to\ndetect the orbital motion of J2222-0137 in our VLBI observations and measure\nthe longitude of ascending node.

We also performed\ndeprojection analysis of annular spectra and derived radial profiles of gas\ntemperature, density and entropy out to approximately 850 kpc (~ 0.6 r_200) and\n560 kpc (~0.4 r_200) in A76 East and A76 West, respectively. Results: The\nmeasured global temperature and metal abundance are approximately 3.3 keV and\n0.24 solar, respectively. From the deprojection analysis, the entropy profile\nis found to be flat with respect to radius. The entropy within the central\nregion (r < 0.2r_200) is exceptionally high (~400 keV cm^2). This phenomenon is\nnot readily explained by either gravitational heating or preheating. The X-ray\nmorphology is clumped and irregular, and the electron density is extremely low\n(1e-4 -- 1e-3 cm^-3) for the observed high temperature, suggesting that A76 is\nin the early phase of cluster formation and the gas compression due to\ngravitational potential confinement is lagging behind the gas heating.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 May 2013 15:59:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}
