Whereas the\ncrystal structure is suggestive of the presence of a quasi-2D network of Cu2+\n(S = 1/2) buckled staircase Kagome layers, the chi(T) data show magnetic\nanisotropy and three magnetic anomalies at temperatures, TN1 ~ 36 K, TN2 ~ 25\nK, TN3 ~ 17 K, respectively. The chi(T) data follow the Curie-Weiss law above\n200 K and a Curie-Weiss temperature Theta_CW ~ -150 K is obtained. The data\ndeviate from the simple Curie-Weiss law below 200 K, which is well above TN1,\nsuggesting the presence of competing magnetic interactions. The magnetic\nanomaly at TN3 appears to be of first-order from magnetization measurements,\nalthough our heat-capacity Cp(T) results do not display any anomaly at TN3. The\nhopping integrals obtained from our electronic structure calculations suggest\nthe presence of significant intra-Kagome (next-nearest neighbor and diagonal)\nand inter-Kagome couplings. These couplings take the PbCu3TeO7 system away from\na disordered ground state and lead to long-range order, in contrast to what\nmight be expected for an ideal (isotropic) 2D Kagome system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 May 2013 16:06:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-20"}

The intent of this method is not a quantitative prediction of the\nbarrier heights, but rather to identify promising mutants for further\ncomputational or experimental study. The method is applied to identify\npromising single and double mutants of Bacillus circulans xylanase (BCX) with\nincreased hydrolytic activity for the artificial substrate ortho-nitrophenyl\n\\beta-xylobioside (ONPX$_2$). The estimated reaction barrier for wild-type (WT)\nBCX is 18.5 kcal/mol, which is in good agreement with the experimental\nactivation free energy value of 17.0 kcal/mol extracted from the observed\nk$_\\text{cat}$ using transition state theory (Joshi et al., Biochemistry 2001,\n40, 10115). The PM6 reaction profiles for eight single point mutations are\nrecomputed using FMO-MP2/PCM/6-31G(d) single points. PM6 predicts an increase\nin barrier height for all eight mutants while FMO predicts an increase for six\nof the eight mutants. Both methods predict that the largest change in barrier\noccurs for N35F, where PM6 and FMO predict a 9.0 and 15.8 kcal/mol increase,\nrespectively. We thus conclude that PM6 is sufficiently accurate to identify\npromising mutants for further study. We prepared a set of all theoretically\npossible (342) single mutants in which every amino acid of the active site\n(except for the catalytically active residues E78 and E172) was mutated to\nevery other amino acid.

Infrared\nobservations of the disk around the young star HD142527, at ~140pc, found an\ninner disk ~10AU in radius, surrounded by a particularly large gap, with a\ndisrupted outer disk beyond 140AU, indicative of a perturbing planetary-mass\nbody at ~90 AU. From radio observations, the bulk mass is molecular and lies in\nthe outer disk, whose continuum emission has a horseshoe morphology. The\nvigorous stellar accretion rate would deplete the inner disk in less than a\nyear, so in order to sustain the observed accretion, matter must flow from the\nouter-disk into the cavity and cross the gap. In dynamical models, the putative\nprotoplanets channel outer-disk material into gap-crossing bridges that feed\nstellar accretion through the inner disk. Here we report observations with the\nAtacama Large Millimetre Array (ALMA) that reveal diffuse CO gas inside the\ngap, with denser HCO+ gas along gap-crossing filaments, and that confirm the\nhorseshoe morphology of the outer disk.

In essence, an FQL test specification amounts to a set of\nregular languages, each of which has to be matched by at least one test\nexecution. To describe such sets of regular languages, the FQL semantics uses\nan automata-theoretic concept known as rational sets of regular languages\n(RSRLs). RSRLs are automata whose alphabet consists of regular expressions.\nThus, the language accepted by the automaton is a set of regular expressions.\n  In this paper, we study RSRLs from a theoretic point of view. More\nspecifically, we analyze RSRL closure properties under common set theoretic\noperations, and the complexity of membership checking, i.e., whether a regular\nlanguage is an element of a RSRL. For all questions we investigate both the\ngeneral case and the case of finite sets of regular languages. Although a few\nproperties are left as open problems, the paper provides a systematic semantic\nfoundation for the test specification language FQL.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 May 2013 22:05:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-28"}

Parameters of the TB model are\nfitted from the first-principles energy bands for all $MX_2$ monolayers. The TB\nmodel involving only the nearest-neighbor $M$-$M$ hoppings is sufficient to\ncapture the band-edge properties in the $\\pm K$ valleys, including the energy\ndispersions as well as the Berry curvatures. The TB model involving up to the\nthird-nearest-neighbor $M$-$M$ hoppings can well reproduce the energy bands in\nthe entire Brillouin zone.

In\nparticular, we formulate power allocation problems to minimize the squared\nposition error bound (SPEB) and the maximum directional position error bound\n(mDPEB), respectively, for a given power budget. We show that such formulations\ncan be efficiently solved via conic programming. Moreover, we design an\nefficient power allocation scheme that allows distributed computations among\nagents. The simulation results show that the proposed schemes significantly\noutperform uniform power allocation, and the robust schemes outperform their\nnon-robust counterparts when the network parameters are subject to uncertainty.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 May 2013 02:04:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-28"}

The study focuses on a 1.50+1.40 Msun main sequence binary with an\neccentricity of 0.25, and an orbital period of about 0.7 d. The reaction of the\nstellar components due to mass transfer is analyzed, and the evolution of mass\ntransfer during the periastron passage is compared to recent smooth particle\nhydrodynamics (SPH) simulations. The impact of asynchronism and non-zero\neccentricity on the Roche lobe radius, and the effects of tidal and rotational\ndeformation on the stars' structures, are also investigated. Calculations were\nperformed using the state-of-the-art binary evolution code BINSTAR, which\ncalculates simultaneously the structure of the two stars and the evolution of\nthe orbital parameters. The evolution of the mass transfer rate during an orbit\nhas a Gaussian-like shape, with a maximum at periastron, in qualitative\nagreement with SPH simulations. The Roche lobe radius is modified by the donor\nstar's spin and the orbital eccentricity. This has a significant impact on both\nthe duration and the rate of mass transfer. We find that below some critical\nrotation rate, mass transfer never occurs, while above some threshold, mass is\ntransferred over the entire orbit. Tidal and rotational deformation of the\ndonor star causes it to become over-sized, enhancing the mass transfer rate\nfurther by about a factor of ten, leading to non-conservative mass transfer.\nThe modulation of mass transfer rate with orbital phase produces short-term\nvariability in the surface luminosity and radius of each star. The longer-term\nbehaviour shows, in accordance with studies of circular systems with radiative\nstars, that the donor becomes ever small and under-luminous, while the converse\nis the case for the accretor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 May 2013 02:09:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

A special case\nof three-body problem is used as an example to illustrate that, due to the\ninherent, physical uncertainty of initial positions in the (dimensionless)\nmicro-level of $10^{-60}$, the chaotic trajectories are essentially uncertain\nin physics after $t > T_p^{max}$, where $T_p^{max}\\approx 810$ for this special\ncase of the three body problem. Thus, physically, it has no sense to talk about\nthe \"accurate, deterministic prediction\" of chaotic trajectories of the three\nbody problem after $t > T_p^{max}$. In addition, our mathematically reliable\nsimulations of the chaotic trajectories of the three bodies suggest that, due\nto the butterfly effect of chaotic dynamic systems, the micro-level physical\nuncertainty of initial conditions might transfer into macroscopic uncertainty.\nThis suggests that micro-level uncertainty might be an origin of some\nmacroscopic uncertainty.

This exploration task is formalized by Low,\nDolan, and Khosla (2008) in a sequential decision-theoretic planning under\nuncertainty framework called MASP. The time complexity of solving MASP\napproximately depends on the map resolution, which limits its use in\nlarge-scale, high-resolution exploration and mapping. To alleviate this\ncomputational difficulty, this paper presents an information-theoretic approach\nto MASP (iMASP) for efficient adaptive path planning; by reformulating the\ncost-minimizing iMASP as a reward-maximizing problem, its time complexity\nbecomes independent of map resolution and is less sensitive to increasing robot\nteam size as demonstrated both theoretically and empirically. Using the\nreward-maximizing dual, we derive a novel adaptive variant of maximum entropy\nsampling, thus improving the induced exploration policy performance. It also\nallows us to establish theoretical bounds quantifying the performance advantage\nof optimal adaptive over non-adaptive policies and the performance quality of\napproximately optimal vs. optimal adaptive policies. We show analytically and\nempirically the superior performance of iMASP-based policies for sampling the\nlog-Gaussian process to that of policies for the widely-used Gaussian process\nin mapping the hotspot field.

In this paper, the\nobservational data of the diffuse FUV radiation by the Far Ultraviolet\nSpectroscopic Explorer is reexamined in order to investigate the correlation\nbetween the diffuse FUV radiation shortward of Ly-alpha and the 100 um\nemission. Large fluctuations were confirmed in the linear-linear correlation\nplots, but good correlations were found in the log-log plots. The large\nfluctuations in the linear-linear plots, and thus poor correlations, between\nthe FUV and 100 um intensities were attributed to the lognormal property of the\nFUV intensity distribution. The standard deviation of the intensity\ndistribution of the FUV radiation shortward of Ly-alpha was found to be\nsigma_log I = 0.16-0.25.

Taking advantage of the large amount of data available in the COSMOS\nfield, the properties of the [NeV]-selected Type-2 AGN have been investigated,\nfocusing on their host galaxies, X-ray emission, and optical line flux ratios.\nFinally, the diagnostic developed by Gilli et al. (2010), based on the X-ray to\n[NeV] luminosity ratio, has been exploited to search for the more heavily\nobscured AGN. We found that [Ne v]-selected narrow line AGN have Seyfert 2-like\noptical spectra, although with emission line ratios diluted by a star-forming\ncomponent. The ACS morphologies and stellar component in the optical spectra\nindicate a preference for our Type-2 AGN to be hosted in early-spirals with\nstellar masses greater than 10^(9.5-10)Msun, on average higher than those of\nthe galaxy parent sample. The fraction of galaxies hosting [NeV]-selected\nobscured AGN increases with the stellar mass, reaching a maximum of about 3% at\n2x10^11 Msun. A comparison with other selection techniques at z~1 shows that\nthe detection of the [Ne v] line is an effective method to select AGN in the\noptical band, in particular the most heavily obscured ones, but can not provide\nby itself a complete census of AGN2. Finally, the high fraction of\n[NeV]-selected Type-2 AGN not detected in medium-deep Chandra observations\n(67%) is suggestive of the inclusion of Compton-thick sources in our sample.\nThe presence of a population of heavily obscured AGN is corroborated by the\nX-ray to [NeV] ratio; we estimated, by mean of X-ray stacking technique and\nsimulations, that the Compton-thick fraction in our sample of Type-2 AGN is\n43+-4%, in good agreement with standard assumptions by the XRB synthesis\nmodels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 May 2013 10:09:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

Controversial results that have been published in last years\nsuggest that in addition to to wavelength calibration problems systematic\nerrors might arise because of insufficient spectral resolution. The aim of this\nwork is to estimate the impact of incorrect line decompositions in fitting\nprocedures due to asymmetric line profiles. Methods are developed to\ndistinguish between different sources of line position shifts and thus to\nminimize error sources in future work. To simulate asymmetric line profiles,\ntwo different methods were used. At first the profile was created as an\nunresolved blend of narrow lines and then, the profile was created using a\nmacroscopic velocity field of the absorbing medium. The simulated spectra were\nanalysed with standard methods to search for apparent shifts of line positions\nthat would mimic a variation of fundamental constants. Differences between\nposition shifts due to an incorrect line decomposition and a real variation of\nconstants were probed using methods that have been newly developed or adapted\nfor this kind of analysis. The results were then applied to real data. Apparent\nrelative velocity shifts of several hundred meters per second are found in the\nanalysis of simulated spectra with asymmetric line profiles. It was found that\neach system has to be analysed in detail to distinguish between different\nsources of line position shifts. A set of 16 FeII systems in seven quasar\nspectra was analysed. With the methods developed, the mean alpha variation that\nappeared in these systems was reduced from the original\nDalpha/alpha=(2.1+/-2.0)x10^-5 to Dalpha/alpha=(0.1+/-0.8)x10^-5.

Unlike traditional set theories such as Zermelo-Fraenkel (ZF) and\nNBG, Chiron is equipped with a type system, lambda notation, and definite and\nindefinite description. The type system includes a universal type, dependent\ntypes, dependent function types, subtypes, and possibly empty types. Unlike\ntraditional logics such as first-order logic and simple type theory, Chiron\nadmits undefined terms that result, for example, from a function applied to an\nargument outside its domain or from an improper definite or indefinite\ndescription. The most noteworthy part of Chiron is its facility for reasoning\nabout the syntax of expressions. Quotation is used to refer to a set called a\nconstruction that represents the syntactic structure of an expression, and\nevaluation is used to refer to the value of the expression that a construction\nrepresents. Using quotation and evaluation, syntactic side conditions, schemas,\nsyntactic transformations used in deduction and computation rules, and other\nsuch things can be directly expressed in Chiron. This paper presents the syntax\nand semantics of Chiron, some definitions and simple examples illustrating its\nuse, a proof system for Chiron, and a notion of an interpretation of one theory\nof Chiron in another.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 May 2013 13:16:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-28"}

More precisely, a generalized\nFisher information naturally pops up in the expression of the derivative of the\nTsallis entropy. This generalized Fisher information also appears as a special\ncase of a generalized Fisher information for estimation problems.

A generalization of this phase retrieval problem\nalso exists in engineering: recovering a vector from measurements consisting of\nnorms of its orthogonal projections onto a family of subspaces. There exist\nsemidefinite programming algorithms to solve this problem, but much remains\nunknown for this more general case. Can families of subspaces for which such\nmeasurements are injective be completely classified? What is the minimal number\nof subspaces required to have injectivity? How closely does this problem\ncompare to the usual phase retrieval problem with families of measurement\nvectors? In this paper, we answer or make incremental steps toward these\nquestions. We provide several characterizations of subspaces which yield\ninjective measurements, and through a concrete construction, we prove the\nsurprising result that phase retrieval can be achieved with $2M-1$ projections\nof arbitrary rank in $\\HH_M$.\n  Finally we present several open problems as we discuss issues unique to the\nphase retrieval problem with subspaces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 May 2013 14:07:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 Jul 2013 17:23:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 18 Jul 2013 15:34:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-19"}

Several authors have used arguments\nbased on extreme value theory in their work on adaptation. There are\ncomplications with these approaches if fitness is additive (meaning that\nfitness effects of mutations sum), or whenever there is more additivity than\nwhat one would expect in an uncorrelated fitness landscape. However, the\napproaches have been used in published work, even in situations with\nsubstantial amounts of additivity. In particular, extreme value theory has been\nused in discussions on evolutionary predictability. We say that evolution is\npredictable if the use of a particular drug at different locations tends lead\nto the same resistance mutations. Evolutionary predictability depends on the\nprobabilities of mutational trajectories. Arguments about probabilities based\non extreme value theory can be misleading. Additivity may cause errors in\nestimates of the probabilities of some mutational trajectories by a factor 20\neven for rather small examples. We show that additivity gives systematic errors\nso as to exaggerate the differences between the most and the least likely\ntrajectory. As a result of this bias, evolution may appear more predictable\nthan it is.

Since\n\"electrons\" and \"holes\" move in different channels, the number densities can be\nhigh especially when the Fermi surface has \"necks\". The strong QHE arises from\nthe phonon exchange attraction in the neighborhood of the \"neck\" Fermi\nsurfaces. The plateau observed for the Hall conductivity and the accompanied\nresistivity drop is due to the Bose-Einstein condensation of the c-bosons, each\nforming from a pair of one-electron--two-fluxons c-fermions by phonon-exchange\nattraction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 May 2013 15:55:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 Jan 2016 07:59:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-18"}

Yet the underlying mechanism is still elusive. We have previously\nshown that a Schnakenberg-type Turing mechanism can recapitulate the branching\nand protein expression patterns in wildtype and mutant lungs, but it is unclear\nwhether this mechanism would extend to other branched organs that are regulated\nby other proteins. Here we show that the GDNF-RET regulatory interaction gives\nrise to a Schnakenberg-type Turing model that reproduces the observed budding\nof the ureteric bud from the Wolffian duct, its invasion into the mesenchyme,\nand the observed branching pattern. The model also recapitulates all relevant\nprotein expression patterns in wild-type and mutant mice. The lung and kidney\nmodels are both based on a particular receptor- ligand interaction and require:\n(1) cooperative binding of ligand and receptor, (2) a lower diffusion\ncoefficient for the receptor than for the ligand, and (3) an increase in the\nreceptor concentration in response to receptor-ligand binding (by enhanced\ntranscription, more recycling or similar). These conditions are met also by\nother receptor-ligand systems. We propose that ligand-receptor based Turing\npatterns represent a general mechanism to control branching morphogenesis and\nother developmental processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 May 2013 15:59:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

The\nrelativistic differential cross-section for the Compton scattering of a photon\nby a stationary free electron was formulated by Klein and Nishina using Dirac's\nrelativistic theory of electrons, and has been verified experimentally, when\nthe binding energy of the electron is negligible compared to the incident\nphoton energy.

There is a high degree of matching\nin a regime where the total electronic Klein-Nishina cross section for the\nCompton scattering on a free stationary electron scales as the inverse of the\nincident photon energy and the contribution of the electro-magnetic interaction\nto differential electronic cross section diminishes.
