This cost stems from the need to maintain\nat least 3t+1 replicas in different storage servers in the asynchronous model,\nso that t Byzantine replica faults can be tolerated. In this paper, we present\nMDStore, the first fully asynchronous read/write BFT storage protocol that\nreduces the number of data replicas to as few as 2t+1, maintaining 3t+1\nreplicas of metadata at (possibly) different servers. At the heart of MDStore\nstore is its metadata service that is built upon a new abstraction we call\ntimestamped storage. Timestamped storage both allows for conditional writes\n(facilitating the implementation of a metadata service) and has consensus\nnumber one (making it implementable wait-free in an asynchronous system despite\nfaults). In addition to its low data replication factor, MDStore offers very\nstrong guarantees implementing multi-writer multi-reader atomic wait-free\nsemantics and tolerating any number of Byzantine readers and crash-faulty\nwriters. We further show that MDStore data replication overhead is optimal;\nnamely, we prove a lower bound of 2t+1 on the number of data replicas that\napplies even to crash-tolerant storage with a fault-free metadata service\noracle. Finally, we prove that separating data from metadata for reducing the\ncost of BFT storage is not possible without cryptographic assumptions. However,\nour MDStore protocol uses only lightweight cryptographic hash functions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 May 2013 16:06:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 24 May 2013 10:13:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 13 Feb 2014 12:05:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-14"}

Bossard, Howe and Stelle have\nrecently conjectured the existence of 16-supercharge off-shell harmonic\nsuperspaces in order to explain the ultraviolet finiteness of pure half-maximal\nsupergravity with no matter multiplets in D=4 at three loops and in D=5 at two\nloops. By assuming the required superspace exists in D=5, they argued that no\nnew divergences should occur at two loops even with the addition of\nabelian-vector matter multiplets. Up to possible issues with the SL(2,R) global\nanomaly of the theory, they reached a similar conclusion in D=4 for two and\nthree loops. The divergences we find contradict these predictions based on the\nexistence of the desired off-shell superspaces. Furthermore, our D=4 results\nare incompatible with the new divergences being due to the anomaly. We find\nthat the two-loop divergences of half-maximal supergravity are directly\ncontrolled by the divergences appearing in ordinary nonsupersymmetric\nYang-Mills theory coupled to scalars, explaining why half-maximal supergravity\ndevelops new divergences when matter multiplets are added.

However, this is not the only possibility;\nNLDBD can in general produce electrons of either chirality, in contrast with\nthe neutrino induced NLDBD which predicts two left-handed electrons. Using an\neffective Lagrangian approach we classify the lepton number violating (LNV)\neffective operators with two leptons of either chirality but no quarks, ordered\naccording to the magnitude of their contribution to NLDBD. We point out that,\nfor each of the three chirality assignments, $e_{L}e_{L},e_{L}e_{R}$ and\n$e_{R}e_{R}$, there is only one LNV operator of the corresponding type to\nlowest order, and these have dimensions 5, 7 and 9, respectively.

The\nphenomenology of a model giving rise to the dimension 9 operator has been\nanalyzed with some detail: if NLDBD is going to be seen in the next round of\nexperiments, the doubly charged scalars of the model could be seen at the LHC\nand lepton flavour violating (LFV) rates could be at the reach of foreseen\nexperiments.

Specifically, we first formulate a meta-conjecture, the NC-Minor\nConjecture, that articulates such a connection between graph theory and network\ncoding, in the language of graph minors. We next prove that the NC-Minor\nConjecture is almost equivalent to the Hadwiger Conjecture, which connects\ngraph minors with graph coloring. Such equivalence implies the existence of\n$K_4$, $K_5$, $K_6$, and $K_{O(q/\\log{q})}$ minors, for networks requiring\n$\\mathbb{F}_3$, $\\mathbb{F}_4$, $\\mathbb{F}_5$ and $\\mathbb{F}_q$,\nrespectively. We finally prove that network coding can make a difference from\nrouting only if the network contains a $K_4$ minor, and this minor containment\nresult is tight. Practical implications of the above results are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 May 2013 18:26:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-22"}

Time evolution of\nthe debris gas around a black hole with mass $M=10^{6} {\\MO}$ is studied by\nperforming axisymmetric, two-dimensional radiation hydrodynamic simulations. We\nassumed the $\\alpha$-prescription of viscosity, in which the viscous stress is\nproportional to the total pressure. The mass supply rate from the outer\nboundary is assumed to be ${\\dot M}_{\\rm supply}=100L_{\\rm Edd}/c^2$, where\n$L_{\\rm Edd}$ is the Eddington luminosity, and $c$ is the light speed. Since\nthe mass accretion rate decreases inward by outflows driven by radiation\npressure, the state transition from a supercritically accreting slim disk state\nto a subcritically accreting Shakura-Sunyaev disk starts from the inner disk\nand propagates outward in a timescale of a day. The sudden drop of the X-ray\nflux observed in Swift J1644+57 in August 2012 can be explained by this\ntransition. As long as ${\\dot M}_{\\rm supply}$ exceeds the threshold for the\nexistence of a radiation pressure dominant disk, accumulation of the accreting\ngas in the subcritically accreting region triggers the transition from a gas\npressure dominant Shakura-Sunyaev disk to a slim disk.

We find the dust masses in the SMC stars to be larger\nthan for any known debris disks, although this evidence against the debris disk\nhypothesis is circumstantial.

The goal is to devise robust ways of extracting low-amplitude\nRV signals of low mass planets in the presence of activity noise. Two\napproaches were used to remove the stellar activity signal which dominates the\nRV variations: 1) Fourier component analysis (pre-whitening), and 2) local\ntrend filtering (LTF) of the activity using short time windows of the data. The\nFourier procedure results in a signal at P = 3.236 days and K = 0.42 m/s which\nis consistent with the presence of an Earth-mass planet, but the false alarm\nprobability for this signal is rather high at a few percent. The LTF results in\nno significant detection of the planet signal, although it is possible to\ndetect a marginal planet signal with this method using a different choice of\ntime windows and fitting functions. However, even in this case the significance\nof the 3.24-d signal depends on the details of how a time window containing\nonly 10% of the data is filtered. Both methods should have detected the\npresence of Alpha Cen Bb at a higher significance than is actually seen. We\nalso investigated the influence of random noise with a standard deviation\ncomparable to the HARPS data and sampled in the same way. The distribution of\nthe noise peaks in the period range 2.8 - 3.3 days have a maximum of\napproximately 3.2 days and amplitudes approximately one-half of the K-amplitude\nfor the planet. The presence of the activity signal may boost the velocity\namplitude of these signals to values comparable to the planet. It may be\npremature to attribute the 3.24 day RV variations to an Earth-mass planet. A\nbetter understanding of the noise characteristics in the RV data as well as\nmore measurements with better sampling will be needed to confirm this\nexoplanet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 May 2013 20:44:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

Currently, science has been established about its cellular structures,\nits metabolic processes, and even the molecular structures of its intrinsic\nmembrane proteins responsible for transporting water, nutrient, and waste\nmolecules across the parasite plasma membrane (PPM). I hypothesize that\nPlasmodium falciparum has an Achilles' heel that can be attacked with\nerythritol, the well-known sweetener that is classified as generally safe. Most\norganisms have in their cell membrane two types of water-channel proteins:\naquaporins to maintain hydro-homeostasis across the membrane and\naquaglyceroporins to uptake glycerols etc. In contrast, P. falciparum has only\none type of such proteins---the multi-functional aquaglyceroporin (PfAQP)\nexpressed in the PPM---to do both jobs. Moreover, the parasite also uses PfAQP\nto excrete its metabolic wastes (ammonia included) produced at a very high rate\nin the blood stage. This extremely high efficiency of the bug using one protein\nfor multiple essential tasks makes the parasite fatally vulnerable. Erythritol\nin the blood stream can kill the parasite by clogging up its PfAQP channel that\nneeds to be open for maintaining hydro-homeostasis and for excreting toxic\nwastes across the bug's PPM. In vitro tests are to measure the growth/death\nrate of P. falciparum in blood with various erythritol concentrations. In vivo\nexperiments are to administer groups of infected mice with various doses of\nerythritol and monitor the parasite growth levels from blood samples drawn from\neach group. Clinic trials can be performed to observe the added effects of\nadministering to patients erythritol along with the known drugs because\nerythritol was classified as a safe food ingredient.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 May 2013 21:01:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-15"}

In order to scale informed transmitter\nschemes to emerging massive MIMO systems with a large number of transmit\nantennas at the base station, one common approach is to employ time division\nduplexing (TDD) and to exploit the implicit feedback obtained from channel\nreciprocity. However, most existing cellular deployments are based on frequency\ndivision duplexing (FDD), hence it is of great interest to explore backwards\ncompatible massive MIMO upgrades of such systems.

The approach exploits the duality between\nsource encoding in a Grassmannian manifold and noncoherent sequence detection.\nFurthermore, since noncoherent detection can be realized near-optimally using a\nbank of coherent detectors, we obtain a low-complexity implementation of NTCQ\nencoding using an off-the-shelf Viterbi algorithm applied to standard trellis\ncoded quantization.

A new method for\ndesigning the transmit beamspace matrix that enables the use of search-free DOA\nestimation techniques at the receiver is introduced. The essence of the\nproposed method is to design the transmit beamspace matrix based on minimizing\nthe difference between a desired transmit beampattern and the actual one under\nthe constraint of uniform power distribution across the transmit array\nelements. The desired transmit beampattern can be of arbitrary shape and is\nallowed to consist of one or more spatial sectors. The number of transmit\nwaveforms is even but otherwise arbitrary. To allow for simple search-free DOA\nestimation algorithms at the receive array, the rotational invariance property\nis established at the transmit array by imposing a specific structure on the\nbeamspace matrix. Semi-definite relaxation is used to transform the proposed\nformulation into a convex problem that can be solved efficiently. We also\npropose a spatial-division based design (SDD) by dividing the spatial domain\ninto several subsectors and assigning a subset of the transmit beams to each\nsubsector. The transmit beams associated with each subsector are designed\nseparately. Simulation results demonstrate the improvement in the DOA\nestimation performance offered by using the proposed joint and SDD transmit\nbeamspace design methods as compared to the traditional MIMO radar technique.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 May 2013 22:59:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

Metallic interfaces with similar electronic properties produced by\namorphous oxide overlayers on SrTiO3 have called in question the original\npolarization catastrophe model. We resolve the issue by a comprehensive\ncomparison of (100)-oriented SrTiO3 substrates with crystalline and amorphous\noverlayers of LaAlO3 of different thicknesses prepared under different oxygen\npressures. For both types of overlayers, there is a critical thickness for the\nappearance of conductivity, but its value is always 4 unit cells (around 1.6\nnm) for the oxygen-annealed crystalline case, whereas in the amorphous case,\nthe critical thickness could be varied in the range 0.5 to 6 nm according to\nthe deposition conditions. Subsequent ion milling of the overlayer restores the\ninsulating state for the oxygen-annealed crystalline heterostructures but not\nfor the amorphous ones. Oxygen post-annealing removes the oxygen vacancies, and\nthe interfaces become insulating in the amorphous case. However, the interfaces\nwith a crystalline overlayer remain conducting with reduced carrier density.\nThese results demonstrate that oxygen vacancies are the dominant source of\nmobile carriers when the LaAlO3 overlayer is amorphous, while both oxygen\nvacancies and polarization catastrophe contribute to the interface conductivity\nin unannealed crystalline LaAlO3/SrTiO3 heterostructures, and the polarization\ncatastrophe alone accounts for the conductivity in oxygen-annealed crystalline\nLaAlO3/SrTiO3 heterostructures. Furthermore, we find that the crystallinity of\nthe LaAlO3 layer is crucial for the polarization catastrophe mechanism in the\ncase of crystalline LaAlO3 overlayers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 May 2013 04:00:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 May 2013 23:54:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-03"}

Using the\nvalues of the Serkowski parameters namely $\\sigma_{1}$, $\\bar \\epsilon$,\n{\\lambda}max and the position of the stars on near infrared color-color\ndiagram, we identified 13 stars that could possibly have intrinsic polarization\nand/or rotation in their polarization angles. One star, 2MASS\nJ06075075+1934177, which is a B4Ve spectral type, show the presence of diffuse\ninterstellar bands in the spectrum apart from showing H{\\alpha} line in\nemission. There is an indication for the presence of slightly bigger dust\ngrains towards L1570 on the basis of the dust grain size-indicators such as\n{\\lambda}max and Rv values. The magnetic field lines are found to be parallel\nto the cloud structures seen in the 250{\\mu}m images (also in 8{\\mu}m and\n12{\\mu}m shadow images) of L1570. Based on the magnetic field geometry, the\ncloud structure and the complex velocity structure, we believe that L1570 is in\nthe process of formation due to the converging flow material mediated by the\nmagnetic field lines. Structure function analysis showed that in the L1570\ncloud region the large scale magnetic fields are stronger when compared with\nthe turbulent component of magnetic fields. The estimated magnetic field\nstrengths suggest that the L1570 cloud region is sub-critical and hence could\nbe strongly supported by the magnetic field lines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 May 2013 07:14:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

In addition to IC, we explore a new culture of society where all\nscore vectors of the candidates are equally likely.

We study asymptotic strategy-proofness and asymptotic\ncollusion-proofness for plurality, veto, $k$-approval, and Borda voting rules\nunder IC as well as ISC assumptions. Specifically, we prove bounds for the\nfraction of manipulable profiles when the number of candidates is large. Our\nresults show that the size of the coalition and the tie-breaking rule play a\ncrucial role in determining whether or not a voting rule satisfies the above\ntwo properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 May 2013 08:58:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 15 Feb 2015 20:03:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-17"}

For nanoscopic materials this may be a determining factor of\ntheir physical behavior. However, even for macroscopic many-body systems, if\nthe strength of this coupling is sufficiently strong, their ground state\nproperties and phase diagram may be severely modified. Also dissipation is\nessential to allow a system in the presence of a time dependent perturbation to\nattain a steady, time independent state. In this case, the non-equilibrium\nphase diagram depends on the intensity of the perturbation and on the strength\nof the coupling of the system to the outside world. In this paper, we\ninvestigate the effects of both, dissipation and time dependent external\nsources in the phase diagram of a many-body system at zero and finite\ntemperatures. For concreteness we consider the specific case of a\nsuperconducting layer under the action of an electric field and coupled to a\nmetallic substrate. The former arises from a time dependent vector potential\nminimally coupled to the electrons in the layer. We introduce a Keldysh\napproach that allows to obtain the time dependence of the superconducting order\nparameter in an adiabatic regime. We study the phase diagram of this system as\na function of the electric field, the coupling to the metallic substrate and\ntemperature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 May 2013 09:30:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-23"}

One of the main obstructions for\na full exploitation of this scenario is the understanding of the role of the\nPlanck-scale-curved geometry of momentum space in the correlations between\nemission and detection times, the \"travel times\" for a particle to go from a\ngiven emitter to a given detector. These travel times appear to receive\nPlanck-scale corrections for which no standard interpretation is applicable,\nand the associated implications for spacetime locality gave rise to the notion\nof \"relative locality\" which is still in the early stages of investigation. We\nhere show that these Planck-scale corrections to travel times can be described\nas \"dual redshift\" (or \"lateshift\"): they are manifestations of momentum-space\ncurvature of the same type already known for ordinary redshift produced by\nspacetime curvature. In turn we can identify the novel notion of \"relative\nmomentum-space locality\" as a known but under-appreciated feature associated to\nordinary redshift produced by spacetime curvature, and this can be described in\ncomplete analogy with the relative spacetime locality that became of interest\nin the recent quantum-gravity literature. We also briefly comment on how these\nfindings may be relevant for an approach to the quantum-gravity problem\nproposed by Max Born in 1938 and centered on Born duality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 May 2013 09:36:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-29"}

So far, most\nstudies in this field have focused on the direct effect of spin transport on\nmagnetization dynamics, but ignored the feedback from the magnetization\ndynamics to the spin transport and back to the magnetization dynamics. Although\nthe feedback is usually weak, there are situations when it can play an\nimportant role in the dynamics. In such situations, self-consistent\ncalculations of the magnetization dynamics and the spin transport can\naccurately describe the feedback. This review describes in detail the feedback\nmechanisms, and presents recent progress in self-consistent calculations of the\ncoupled dynamics. We pay special attention to three representative examples,\nwhere the feedback generates non-local effective interactions for the\nmagnetization. Possibly the most dramatic feedback example is the dynamic\ninstability in magnetic nanopillars with a single magnetic layer. This\ninstability does not occur without non-local feedback. We demonstrate that full\nself-consistent calculations generate simulation results in much better\nagreement with experiments than previous calculations that addressed the\nfeedback effect approximately. The next example is for more typical spin valve\nnanopillars. Although the effect of feedback is less dramatic because even\nwithout feedback the current can induce magnetization oscillation, the feedback\ncan still have important consequences. For instance, we show that the feedback\ncan reduce the linewidth of oscillations, in agreement with experimental\nobservations. Finally, we consider nonadiabatic electron transport in narrow\ndomain walls. The non-local feedback in these systems leads to a significant\nrenormalization of the effective nonadiabatic spin transfer torque.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 May 2013 11:15:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

The model is based on the concept of a relativistic\njet interacting with compact gas condensations produced when a star (red giant)\ncrosses the jet close to the central black hole. The study includes an\nanalytical treatment of the evolution of the envelop lost by the star within\nthe jet, and calculations of the related high-energy radiation. The model\nreadily explains the day-long, variable on timescales of hours, GeV gamma-ray\nflare from 3C454.3, observed during November 2010 on top of a weeks-long\nplateau. In the proposed scenario, the plateau state is caused by a strong wind\ngenerated by the heating of the star atmosphere by nonthermal particles\naccelerated at the jet-star interaction region. The flare itself could be\nproduced by a few clouds of matter lost by the red giant after the initial\nimpact of the jet.

This concerns, in particular, global gauge symmetry\nbreaking, related to Bose-Einstein condensation and superconductivity, or\nisotropy breaking, related to the generation of quantum vortices, and the\nstratification in multicomponent mixtures. A special type of symmetry\ntransformation, characteristic only for finite systems, is the change of shape\nsymmetry. These phenomena are illustrated by the examples of several typical\nmesoscopic systems, such as trapped atoms, quantum dots, atomic nuclei, and\nmetallic grains. The specific features of the review are: (i) the emphasis on\nthe peculiarities of the symmetry breaking in finite mesoscopic systems; (ii)\nthe analysis of common properties of physically different finite quantum\nsystems; (iii) the manifestations of symmetry breaking in the spectra of\ncollective excitations in finite quantum systems.

In contrast to that, we demonstrate that (B) does not\nimply (A). Our methods also give a new perspective on the\nKnus-Parimala-Srinivas proof of Saltman's Theorem. Finally, we give a method to\ntest Azumaya algebras of exponent $2$ for the existence of involutions, and use\nit to construct explicit examples of such algebras.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 May 2013 13:56:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 12 Jun 2013 16:43:09 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 15 Jul 2013 10:56:51 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 7 Apr 2014 09:37:54 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 23 Feb 2015 19:11:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-07"}

In a previous work we presented a long slit coronagraph (LSC), for\nwhich the presence of a slit in the coronagraphic focal plane induces a complex\ndistribution of energy in the Lyot pupil-plane that cannot be easily masked\nwith a binary Lyot stop. To alleviate this concern, we propose to use a pupil\napodization to suppress diffraction, creating an apodized long slit coronagraph\n(ALSC).

We perform different sets of simulations with and without\naberrations, and with and without a slit to demonstrate that the apodization is\na more appropriate concept for LSS, at the expense of a significantly reduced\nthroughput (37%) compared to the LSC. Then we perform detailed end-to-end\nsimulations of the LSC and the ALSC that include realistic levels of\naberrations to obtain datasets representing 1h of integration time on stars of\nspectral types A0 to M0 located at 10 pc.

Several exoplanet direct imaging instruments will soon be in\noperation. They use an extreme adaptive optics (XAO) system to correct the\natmospheric turbulence and provide a highly-corrected beam to a near-infrared\n(NIR) coronagraph for starlight suppression. The performance of the coronagraph\nis however limited by the non-common path aberrations (NCPA) due to the\ndifferential wavefront errors existing between the visible XAO sensing path and\nthe NIR science path, leading to residual speckles in the coronagraphic image.\nAims. Several approaches have been developed in the past few years to\naccurately calibrate the NCPA, correct the quasi-static speckles and allow the\nobservation of exoplanets at least 1e6 fainter than their host star. We propose\nan approach based on the Zernike phase-contrast method for the measurements of\nthe NCPA between the optical path seen by the visible XAO wavefront sensor and\nthat seen by the near-IR coronagraph. Methods. This approach uses a focal plane\nphase mask of size {\\lambda}/D, where {\\lambda} and D denote the wavelength and\nthe telescope aperture diameter, respectively, to measure the quasi-static\naberrations in the upstream pupil plane by encoding them into intensity\nvariations in the downstream pupil image. We develop a rigorous formalism,\nleading to highly accurate measurement of the NCPA, in a quasi-linear way\nduring the observation. Results. For a static phase map of standard deviation\n44 nm rms at {\\lambda} = 1.625 {\\mu}m (0.026 {\\lambda}), we estimate a possible\nreduction of the chromatic NCPA by a factor ranging from 3 to 10 in the\npresence of AO residuals compared with the expected performance of a typical\ncurrent-generation system. This would allow a reduction of the level of\nquasi-static speckles in the detected images by a factor 10 to 100 hence,\ncorrespondingly improving the capacity to observe exoplanets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 May 2013 14:11:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 31 May 2013 16:23:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

The radio galaxy IC 310 has recently been identified as a gamma-ray\nemitter based on observations at GeV energies with Fermi-LAT and at very high\nenergies (VHE, E>100GeV) with the MAGIC telescopes. Originally classified as a\nhead-tail radio galaxy, the nature of this object is subject of controversy\nsince its nucleus shows blazar-like behavior. Aims. In order to understand the\nnature of IC 310 and the origin of the VHE emission we studied the spectral and\nflux variability of IC 310 from the X-ray band to the VHE gamma-ray regime.\nMethods. The light curve of IC 310 above 300GeV has been measured with the\nMAGIC telescopes from Oct. 2009 to Feb. 2010. Fermi-LAT data (2008-2011) in the\n10-500GeV energy range were also analyzed. In X-ray, archival observations from\n2003 to 2007 with XMM, Chandra, and Swift-XRT in the 0.5-10keV band were\nstudied. Results. The VHE light curve reveals several high-amplitude and\nshort-duration flares. Day-to-day flux variability is clearly present. The\nphoton index between 120GeV and 8TeV remains at the value $\\Gamma\\sim2.0$\nduring both low and high flux states. The VHE spectral shape does not show\nsignificant variability, whereas the flux at 1TeV changes by a factor of\n$\\sim7$. Fermi-LAT detected only eight gamma-ray events in the energy range\n10GeV-500GeV in three years of observation. The measured photon index of\n$\\Gamma=1.3\\pm0.5$ in the Fermi-LAT range is very hard. The X-ray measurements\nshow strong variability in flux and photon index. The latter varied from\n$1.76\\pm0.07$ to $2.55\\pm0.07$. Conclusion. The rapid variability measured\nconfirms the blazar-like behavior of IC 310. The TeV emission seems to\noriginate from scales of less than 80 Schwarzschild radii within the compact\ncore of its FRI radio jet with orientation angle 10deg-38deg.

Their emergence signaled the end of the\ncosmic dark ages, a few hundred million years after the Big Bang, leading to a\nfundamental transformation of the early Universe through the production of\nionizing photons and the initial enrichment with heavy chemical elements. We\nhere review the state of our knowledge, separating the well understood elements\nof our emerging picture from those where more work is required. Primordial star\nformation is unique in that its initial conditions can be directly inferred\nfrom the Lambda Cold Dark Matter (LCDM) model of cosmological structure\nformation. Combined with gas cooling that is mediated via molecular hydrogen,\none can robustly identify the regions of primordial star formation, the\nso-called minihalos, having total masses of ~10^6 M_sun and collapsing at\nredshifts z~20-30. Within this framework, a number of studies have defined a\npreliminary standard model, with the main result that the first stars were\npredominantly massive. This model has recently been modified to include a\nubiquitous mode of fragmentation in the protostellar disks, such that the\ntypical outcome of primordial star formation may be the formation of a binary\nor small multiple stellar system. We will also discuss extensions to this\nstandard picture due to the presence of dynamically significant magnetic\nfields, of heating from self-annihalating WIMP dark matter, or cosmic rays. We\nconclude by discussing possible strategies to empirically test our theoretical\nmodels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 May 2013 15:58:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 Dec 2013 22:29:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-09"}

An intermediate virtual viewpoint\nimage is commonly synthesized using two pairs of transmitted texture and depth\nmaps from two neighboring captured viewpoints via depth-image-based rendering\n(DIBR). To maintain high quality of synthesized images, it is imperative to\ncontain the adverse effects of network packet losses that may arise during\ntexture and depth video transmission. Towards this end, we develop an\nintegrated approach that exploits the representation redundancy inherent in the\nmultiple streamed videos a voxel in the 3D scene visible to two captured views\nis sampled and coded twice in the two views. In particular, at the receiver we\nfirst develop an error concealment strategy that adaptively blends\ncorresponding pixels in the two captured views during DIBR, so that pixels from\nthe more reliable transmitted view are weighted more heavily. We then couple it\nwith a sender-side optimization of reference picture selection (RPS) during\nreal-time video coding, so that blocks containing samples of voxels that are\nvisible in both views are more error-resiliently coded in one view only, given\nadaptive blending will erase errors in the other view. Further, synthesized\nview distortion sensitivities to texture versus depth errors are analyzed, so\nthat relative importance of texture and depth code blocks can be computed for\nsystem-wide RPS optimization. Experimental results show that the proposed\nscheme can outperform the use of a traditional feedback channel by up to 0.82\ndB on average at 8% packet loss rate, and by as much as 3 dB for particular\nframes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 May 2013 18:06:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-24"}
