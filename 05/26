We employ the semiclassical Boltzmann equation with a collision\nintegral that includes contributions from electron-electron (e-e) and\nelectron-optical phonon interactions. Taking advantage of circular symmetry and\nemploying the massless Dirac Fermion (MDF) Hamiltonian, we are able to perform\nan essentially analytical study of the e-e contribution to the collision\nintegral. This allows us to take particular care of subtle collinear scattering\nprocesses - processes in which incoming and outgoing momenta of the scattering\nparticles lie on the same line - including carrier multiplication (CM) and\nAuger recombination (AR). These processes have a vanishing phase space for two\ndimensional MDF bare bands. However, we argue that electron-lifetime effects,\nseen in experiments based on angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, provide\na natural pathway to regularize this pathology, yielding a finite contribution\ndue to CM and AR to the Coulomb collision integral. Finally, we discuss in\ndetail the role of physics beyond the Fermi golden rule by including screening\nin the matrix element of the Coulomb interaction at the level of the Random\nPhase Approximation (RPA), focusing in particular on the consequences of\nvarious approximations including static RPA screening, which maximizes the\nimpact of CM and AR processes, and dynamical RPA screening, which completely\nsuppresses them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 May 2013 16:05:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-02"}

They have multiple slots to\nprovide deals with significant discounts to their visitors every day. The\ncurrent user traffic allocation mostly relies on human decisions. We study the\nproblem of automatically allocating the user traffic of a group-buying website\nto different deals to maximize the total revenue and refer to it as the\nGroup-buying Allocation Problem (\\GAP). The key challenge of \\GAP\\ is how to\nhandle the tipping point (lower bound) and the purchase limit (upper bound) of\neach deal. We formulate \\GAP\\ as a knapsack-like problem with variable-sized\nitems and majorization constraints. Our main results for \\GAP\\ can be\nsummarized as follows. (1) We first show that for a special case of \\GAP, in\nwhich the lower bound equals the upper bound for each deal, there is a simple\ndynamic programming-based algorithm that can find an optimal allocation in\npseudo-polynomial time. (2) The general case of \\GAP\\ is much more difficult\nthan the special case. To solve the problem, we first discover several\nstructural properties of the optimal allocation, and then design a two-layer\ndynamic programming-based algorithm leveraging those properties. This algorithm\ncan find an optimal allocation in pseudo-polynomial time. (3) We convert the\ntwo-layer dynamic programming based algorithm to a fully polynomial time\napproximation scheme (FPTAS), using the technique developed in\n\\cite{ibarra1975fast}, combined with some careful modifications of the dynamic\nprograms. Besides these results, we further investigate some natural\ngeneralizations of \\GAP, and propose effective algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 May 2013 16:22:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 Sep 2013 06:07:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 26 Nov 2013 12:11:41 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 17 Dec 2013 05:36:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-18"}

The assembly\nof all cell insides and cell walls are termed symplast and apoplast,\nrespectively. Water transport is pressure driven in both, where osmosis plays\nan essential role in membrane crossing. In this paper, a microscopic model of\nwater flow and transport of an osmotically active solute in a plant tissue is\nconsidered. The model is posed on the scale of a single cell and the tissue is\nassumed to be composed of periodically distributed cells. The flow in the\nsymplast can be regarded as a viscous Stokes flow, while Darcy's law applies in\nthe porous apoplast. Transmission conditions at the interface (semipermeable\nmembrane) are obtained by balancing the mass fluxes through the interface and\nby describing the protein mediated transport as a surface reaction. Applying\nhomogenization techniques, macroscopic equations for water and solute transport\nin a plant tissue are derived. The macroscopic problem is given by a Darcy law\nwith a force term proportional to the difference in concentrations of the\nosmotically active solute in the symplast and apoplast; i.e. the flow is also\ndriven by the local concentration difference and its direction can be different\nthan the one prescribed by the pressure gradient.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 May 2013 16:53:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-28"}

This\npaper investigates this problem under Markovian conditions, namely either the\nsources or the functions considered are Markovian. We propose using linear\nmappings over finite rings as encoders. If the function considered admits\ncertain polynomial structure, the linear encoders can make use of this\nstructure to establish \"implicit collaboration\" and boost the performance. In\nfact, this approach universally applies to any scenario (arbitrary function)\nbecause any discrete function admits a polynomial presentation of required\nformat.\n  There are several useful discoveries in the paper. The first says that linear\nencoder over non-field ring can be equally optimal for compressing data\ngenerated by an irreducible Markov source. Secondly, regarding the previous\nfunction-encoding problem, there are infinitely many circumstances where linear\nencoder over non-field ring strictly outperforms its field counterpart. To be\nmore precise, it is seen that the set of coding rates achieved by linear\nencoder over certain non-field rings is strictly larger than the one achieved\nby the field version, regardless which finite field is considered. Therefore,\nin this sense, linear coding over finite field is not optimal.

Two\ngeneralizations of UFL are capacitated facility location (CFL) and\nlower-bounded facility location (LBFL). In the former, every facility has a\ncapacity which is the maximum demand that can be assigned to it, while in the\nlatter, every open facility is required to serve a given minimum amount of\ndemand. Both CFL and LBFL are approximable within a constant factor but their\nrespective natural LP relaxations have an unbounded integrality gap. According\nto Shmoys and Williamson, the existence of a relaxation-based algorithm for CFL\nis one of the top 10 open problems in approximation algorithms.\n  In this paper we give the first results on this problem. We provide\nsubstantial evidence against the existence of a good LP relaxation for CFL by\nshowing unbounded integrality gaps for two families of strengthened\nformulations.\n  The first family we consider is the hierarchy of LPs resulting from repeated\napplications of the lift-and-project Lov\\'{a}sz-Schrijver procedure starting\nfrom the standard relaxation.

Following a brief sensing\nperiod, the SU can operate in either simultaneous transmit-and-sense (TS) mode\nor simultaneous transmit-and-receive (TR) mode.

We detected multiple imaging in the low\ngalactic latitude (b=-2 deg) quasar 2023+335 from the 15.4 GHz MOJAVE\nobservations when the source was undergoing an ESE.

However, in only few cases it has been studied by\nquantitative application of realistic and physically justified global models.\nHere we present a dynamical analysis of the photometry and three-dimensional\nkinematics of omega Cen, 47 Tuc, and M15, by means of a recently introduced\nfamily of self-consistent axisymmetric rotating models. The three clusters,\ncharacterized by different relaxation conditions, show evidence of differential\nrotation and deviations from sphericity. The combination of line-of-sight\nvelocities and proper motions allows us to determine their internal dynamics,\npredict their morphology, and estimate their dynamical distance. The\nwell-relaxed cluster 47 Tuc is very well interpreted by our model; internal\nrotation is found to explain the observed morphology. For M15, we provide a\nglobal model in good agreement with the data, including the central behavior of\nthe rotation profile and the shape of the ellipticity profile. For the\npartially relaxed cluster omega Cen, the selected model reproduces the complex\nthree-dimensional kinematics; in particular the observed anisotropy profile,\ncharacterized by a transition from isotropy, to weakly-radial anisotropy, and\nthen to tangential anisotropy in the outer parts. The discrepancy found for the\nsteep central gradient in the observed line-of-sight velocity dispersion\nprofile and for the ellipticity profile is ascribed to the condition of only\npartial relaxation of this cluster and the interplay between rotation and\nradial anisotropy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 May 2013 14:10:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

However, the link between contrast variations\nin successive images to the underlying plasma motions has to be quantitatively\nconfirmed. Radiation hydrodynamics simulations of solar granulation\n(e.g.,CO5BOLD) provide access to both the wavelength-integrated, emergent\ncontinuum intensity and the 3D velocity field at various heights in the solar\natmosphere. Thus, applying LCT to continuum images yields horizontal proper\nmotions, which are then compared to the velocity field of the simulated\n(non-magnetic) granulation. In this study, we evaluate the performance of an\nLCT algorithm previously developed for bulk-processing Hinode G-band images,\nestablish it as a quantitative tool for measuring horizontal proper motions,\nand clearly work out the limitations of LCT or similar techniques designed to\ntrack optical flows. Horizontal flow maps and frequency distributions of the\nflow speed were computed for a variety of LCT input parameters including the\nspatial resolution, the width of the sampling window, the time cadence of\nsuccessive images, and the averaging time used to determine persistent flow\nproperties. Smoothed velocity fields from the hydrodynamics simulation at three\natmospheric layers (log tau=-1,0,and +1) served as a point of reference for the\nLCT results. LCT recovers many of the granulation properties, e.g.,the shape of\nthe flow speed distributions, the relationship between mean flow speed and\naveraging time, and also--with significant smoothing of the simulated velocity\nfield--morphological features of the flow and divergence maps. However, the\nhorizontal proper motions are grossly underestimated by as much as a factor of\nthree.
