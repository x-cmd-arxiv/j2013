However, Li-ion batteries suffer from strong\nself-heating, which limits their life-time and creates reliability and\nenvironmental problems. Here we show that thermal management and the\nreliability of Li-ion batteries can be drastically improved using hybrid phase\nchange material with graphene fillers. Conventional thermal management of\nbatteries relies on the latent heat stored in the phase change material as its\nphase changes over a small temperature range, thereby reducing the temperature\nrise inside the battery. Incorporation of graphene to the hydrocarbon-based\nphase change material allows one to increase its thermal conductivity by more\nthan two orders of magnitude while preserving its latent heat storage ability.\nA combination of the sensible and latent heat storage together with the\nimproved heat conduction outside of the battery pack leads to a significant\ndecrease in the temperature rise inside a typical Li-ion battery pack. The\ndescribed combined heat storage - heat conduction approach can lead to a\ntransformative change in thermal management of Li-ion and other types of\nbatteries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 May 2013 17:46:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-12"}

For quantum\nradar, atmospheric absorption and diffraction rapidly degrades any actively\ntransmitted quantum states of light, such as N00N states, so that for this\nhigh-loss regime the optimal strategy is to transmit coherent states of light,\nwhich suffer no worse loss than the linear Beer's law for classical radar\nattenuation, and which provide sensitivity at the shot-noise limit in the\nreturned power. We show that coherent radar radiation sources, coupled with a\nquantum homodyne detection scheme, provide both longitudinal and angular\nsuper-resolution much below the Rayleigh diffraction limit, with sensitivity at\nshot-noise in terms of the detected photon power.

By \"pixel-dense\" we understand that each pixel displays individually\nmeasured distance information, neither interpolated from its neighbour pixels\nnor using lateral context information. Hence, for monomodal single-shot\nprinciples, the 3D data generated from one 2D raw image display a significantly\nlower space-bandwidth than the camera permits.

At the same time, we derive an upper bound by demanding that\nthe interstellar medium of the dSphs is in pressure equilibrium with the hot\ncorona. We consider two dwarfs (Sextans and Carina) with well-determined orbits\nand star formation histories. Our approach introduces several novel features:\nwe use the measured star formation histories of the dwarfs to derive the time\nat which they last lost their gas, and (via a modified version of the\nKennicutt-Schmidt relation) their internal gas density at that time; we use a\nlarge suite of 2D hydrodynamical simulations to model the gas stripping; and we\ninclude supernova feedback tied to the gas content.

It has been suggested that the baryonic\ncondensation of the intra-cluster medium (ICM) due to cooling may drag dark\nmatter to the cores and thus steepen the profile. In this work, we search for\nevidence of ongoing ICM cooling in the first large, well-defined sample of\nstrong lensing selected galaxy clusters in the range 0.1 < z < 0.6. Based on\nknown correlations between the ICM cooling rate and both optical emission line\nluminosity and star formation, we measure, for a sample of 89 strong lensing\nclusters, the fraction of clusters that have [OII]3727 emission in their\nbrightest cluster galaxy (BCG). We find that the fraction of line-emitting BCGs\nis constant as a function of redshift for z > 0.2 and shows no statistically\nsignificant deviation from the total cluster population. Specific star\nformation rates, as traced by the strength of the 4000 angstrom break, D_4000,\nare also consistent with the general cluster population. Finally, we use\noptical imaging of the SL clusters to measure the angular separation, R_arc,\nbetween the arc and the center of mass of each lensing cluster in our sample\nand test for evidence of changing [OII] emission and D_4000 as a function of\nR_arc, a proxy observable for SL cross-sections. D_4000 is constant with all\nvalues of R_arc, and the [OII] emission fractions show no dependence on R_arc\nfor R_arc > 10\" and only very marginal evidence of increased weak [OII]\nemission for systems with R_arc < 10\". These results argue against the ability\nof baryonic cooling associated with cool core activity in the cores of galaxy\nclusters to strongly modify the underlying dark matter potential, leading to an\nincrease in strong lensing cross-sections.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 May 2013 20:02:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-11"}

Many previous minimalistic models used to describe the\nquantum path interference driven by incoherent fields are based on the\napproximations including the second order perturbation for the weak coupling\nlimit, the ad-hoc choices of two-time correlation functions and $\\it{etc}$. On\nthe other hand, the similar model to study the non-adiabatic molecular\nelectronic excitation have been extensively developed and many efficient\nquantum molecular dynamics simulation schemes, such as the Ehrenfest scheme,\nhave been proposed.\n  In this paper, I aim to propose an unified model, extend the Ehrenfest scheme\nto study the interactions of system-light and system-phonon simultaneously and\ngain insight into and principles of the roles of quantum path interferences in\nthe realistic molecular systems. I discuss how to derive the time-dependent\nstochastic Schr$\\ddot{o}$dinger equation from the Ehrenfest scheme as a\nfoundation to discuss the detailed balance for the weak coupling limit and\ntherefore the quantum correction in the Ehrenfest scheme. Different from the\nmaster equation technique, the Ehrenfest scheme doesn't need any specific\nassumptions about spectral densities and two time correlation functions. With\nsimple open two-level and three-level quantum systems, I show the effect of the\nquantum path interference on the steady state populations. Currently I only\nfocus on the role of the phonon thermal reservoir. The electromagnetic field\n(solar light) will be modeled as a thermal reservoir and discussed in detail in\nthe future paper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 May 2013 21:49:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 Jun 2013 14:22:59 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 21 Oct 2013 01:13:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-22"}

The\ndetermination of the luminosity function of these stars, even if far from being\nconclusive, is extremely important to test the reliability of theoretical\nmodels. In particular, strong constraints on the mixing treatment and the\nmass-loss rate can be derived.\n  We present an updated Luminosity Function of Galactic Carbon Stars obtained\nfrom a re-analysis of available data already published in previous papers.\nStarting from available near- and mid-infrared photometric data, we\nre-determine the selection criteria. Moreover, we take advantage from updated\ndistance estimates and Period-Luminosity relations and we adopt a new\nformulation for the computation of Bolometric Corrections. This leads us to\ncollect an improved sample of carbon-rich sources from which we construct an\nupdated Luminosity Function.\n  The Luminosity Function of Galactic Carbon Stars peaks at magnitudes around\n-4.9, confirming the results obtained in a previous work. Nevertheless, the\nLuminosity Function presents two symmetrical tails instead of the larger high\nluminosity tail characterizing the former Luminosity Function. The derived\nLuminosity Function of Galactic Carbon Stars matches the indications coming\nfrom recent theoretical evolutionary Asymptotic Giant Branch models, thus\nconfirming the validity of the choices of mixing treatment and mass-loss\nhistory. Moreover, we compare our new Luminosity Function with its counterpart\nin the Large Magellanic Cloud finding that the two distributions are very\nsimilar for dust-enshrouded sources, as expected from stellar evolutionary\nmodels.

G. Simpson hypothesized that\nclades of species evolve in adaptive zones, defined as collections of niches\noccupied by species with similar traits and patterns of habitat use. Simpson\nhypothesized that species enter new adaptive zones in one of three ways:\nextinction of competitor species, dispersal to a new geographic region, or the\nevolution of a key trait that allows species to exploit resources in a new way.\nHowever, direct tests of Simpson's hypotheses for the entry into new adaptive\nzones remain elusive. Here we evaluate the fit of a Simpsonian model of jumps\nbetween adaptive zones to phylogenetic comparative data. We use a novel\nstatistical approach to show that anoles, a well-studied adaptive radiation of\nCaribbean lizards, have evolved by a series of evolutionary jumps in trait\nevolution. Furthermore, as Simpson predicted, trait axes strongly tied to\nhabitat specialization show jumps that correspond with the evolution of key\ntraits and/or dispersal between islands in the Greater Antilles. We conclude\nthat jumps are commonly associated with major adaptive shifts in the\nevolutionary radiation of anoles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 May 2013 01:53:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-21"}

The\nsecond issue is how D2D users should choose between communicating directly or\nvia the base station, a choice that depends on distance between the potential\nD2D transmitter and receiver. We propose a tractable hybrid network model where\nthe positions of mobiles are modeled by random spatial Poisson point process,\nwith which we present a general analytical approach that allows a unified\nperformance evaluation for these questions.

Further,\nfrom a coverage perspective, we reveal a tradeoff between the spectrum access\nfactor and the D2D mode selection threshold in the underlay: as more D2D links\nare allowed (due to a more relaxed mode selection threshold), the network\nshould actually make less spectrum available to them to limit their\ninterference.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 May 2013 02:59:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 22 Jun 2013 17:34:28 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 26 Nov 2013 15:02:58 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 6 Mar 2014 22:59:36 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 23 Sep 2014 21:25:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

By comparing the photoluminescence and electroluminescence\nof a MoS2 diode, direct-exciton and bound-exciton related recombination\nprocesses can be identified. Auger recombination of the exciton-exciton\nannihilation of bound exciton emission is observed under a high electron-hole\npair injection rate at room temperature. We expect the direct exciton-exciton\nannihilation lifetime to exceed the carrier lifetime, due to the absence of any\nnoticeable direct exciton saturation.

The optimal single RS scheme in minimizing the symbol error rate\n(SER) is revised by incorporating the outdated channels. The analytical\nexpressions of end-to-end signal to noise ratio (SNR) and symbol error rate\n(SER) are derived in a closed-form, along with the asymptotic SER expression in\nhigh SNR.

Thus the curved\nlength of closest approach between two centers of mass of hard discs on this\ncircumference is $\\sigma=2R_0\\sin^{-1}(R/R_0)$, the length of the circular\narcs. From the density functional of circular arcs, and by applying a\ndimensional expansion procedure to the spatial dimension orthogonal to the\nplane of the circumference, we finally obtain the density functional of curved\nrectangles of edge-lengths $\\sigma$ and $L$. The DF for curved rectangles can\nalso be obtained by fixing the centers of mass of parallel hard cylinders of\nradius $R$ and length $L$ on a cylindrical surface of radius $R_0$.

Telomeres at\nthe end of each chromosome are shortened at cell division and, when they reach\na critical length, the cell will enter permanent cell cycle arrest - a state\nknown as senescence. This mechanism is thought to be tumor suppressing, as it\nhelps prevent precancerous cells from dividing uncontrollably.\n  Stem cells express the enzyme telomerase, which elongates the telomeres,\nthereby postponing senescence. However, unlike germ cells and most types of\ncancer cells, stem cells only express telomerase at levels insufficient to\nfully maintain the length of their telomeres leading to a slow decline in\nproliferation potential. It is not yet fully understood how this decline\ninfluences the risk of cancer and the longevity of the organism. We here\ndevelop a stochastic model to explore the role of telomere dynamics in relation\nto both senescence and cancer. The model describes the accumulation of\ncancerous mutations in a multicellular organism and creates a coherent\ntheoretical framework for interpreting the results of several recent\nexperiments on telomerase regulation. We demonstrate that the longest average\ncancer free life span before cancer onset is obtained when stem cells start\nwith relatively long telomeres that are shortened at a steady rate at cell\ndivision. Furthermore, the risk of cancer early in life can be reduced by\nhaving a short initial telomere length. Finally, our model suggests that\nevolution will favour a shorter than optimal average cancer free life span in\norder to postpone cancer onset until late in life.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 May 2013 13:23:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}
