We treat the general case of different surfaces (different\ncarrier densities, uncorrelated disorder, arbitrary dielectric environment,\netc.). In order to access the low-energy behavior of the system we renormalize\nthe interacting diffusive sigma model in the one loop approximation. It is\nshown that intersurface interaction is relevant in the renormalization group\n(RG) sense and the case of decoupled surfaces is therefore unstable. An\nanalysis of the emerging RG flow yields a rather rich behavior. We discuss\nrealistic experimental scenarios and predict a characteristic non-monotonic\ntemperature dependence of the conductivity. In the infrared (low-temperature)\nlimit, the systems flows into a metallic fixed point. At this point, even\ninitially different surfaces have the same transport properties. Investigating\ntopological effects, we present a local expression of the $\\mathbb Z_2$ theta\nterm in the sigma model by first deriving the Wess-Zumino-Witten theory for\nclass DIII by means of non-abelian bosonization and then breaking the symmetry\ndown to AII. This allows us to study a response of the system to an external\nelectromagnetic field. Further, we discuss the difference between the system of\nDirac fermions on the top and bottom surfaces of a topological insulator slab\nand its non-topological counterpart in a double-well structure with strong\nspin-orbit interaction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 May 2013 16:00:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 Aug 2013 15:11:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-06"}

In the present paper, the VSST taking\nplace in (Pr0.7Sm0.3)0.7Ca0.3CoO3 at T* = about 90 K is investigated by\nmagnetization and heat capacity measurements. First, we quantitatively\ncharacterized the jumps in magnetic susceptibility (khi) and entropy (S) around\nT*. Then, these values were compared to those calculated as a function of the\nvariations in the population of the different cationic species involved in the\nVSST. X-ray absorption spectroscopy experiments recently showed that the higher\nspin state above T* should be regarded as an inhomogeneous mixture between\nlow-spin (LS) and high-spin (HS) states. In the frame of this description, we\ndemonstrate that the jumps in both khi and S can be associated to the same\nchange in the Co3+ HS content around T*. This result lends further support to\nthe relevance of the LS/HS picture for the VSST, challenging the currently\ndominant interpretation based on the occurrence of an intermediate-spin (IS)\nstate of Co3+ above T*.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 May 2013 16:19:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

The system is famous for\nshowing the dust properties of a debris disk, but the gas properties of a\nlow-mass protoplanetary disk. The data were acquired with the Herschel Space\nObservatory PACS and SPIRE instruments, largely as part of the \"Gas in\nProtoplanetary Systems\" (GASPS) Open Time Key Programme. Disk dust emission is\ndetected in images at 70, 160, 250, 350, and 500 \\mu m; 49 Cet is significantly\nextended in the 70 \\mu m image, spatially resolving the outer dust disk for the\nfirst time.

The CII line was detected at the 5\\sigma\\ level - the first\ndetection of atomic emission from the disk.

Our calculations\nreveal that changes in the charge state of O2 dimers controls the defect\nchemistry and conductivity of Li2O2. Negative lithium vacancies (missing Li+)\nand small hole polarons are identified as the dominant charge carriers. The\nelectronic conductivity associated with polaron hopping (5 x 10-20 S/cm) is\ncomparable to the ionic conductivity arising from the migration of Li-ions (4 x\n10-19 S/cm), suggesting that charge transport in Li2O2 occurs through a mixture\nof ionic and polaronic contributions. These data indicate that the bulk regions\nof crystalline Li2O2 are insulating, with appreciable charge transport\noccurring only at moderately high charging potentials that drive partial\ndelithiation.

First, haloes are extended, non-overlapping objects, i.e., their\ncorrelation function needs to go to -1 on small scales. This leads to a\nnegative correction to the stochasticity relative to the Poisson value at low\nwavenumber k, decreasing to zero for wavenumbers large compared to the inverse\nexclusion scale. Second, haloes show a non-linear enhancement of clustering\noutside the exclusion scale, leading to a positive stochasticity correction.\nBoth of these effects go to zero for high-k, making the stochasticity scale\ndependent even for k<0.1 h/Mpc. We show that the corrections in the low-k\nregime are the same in Eulerian and Lagrangian space, but that the transition\nscale is pushed to smaller scales for haloes observed at present time, relative\nto the initial conditions. These corrections vary with halo mass and redshift.\nWe also discuss simple applications of these effects to the galaxy samples with\nnon-vanishing satellite fraction, where the stochasticity can again deviate\nstrongly from the fiducial Poisson expectation. Overall these effects affect\nthe clustering of galaxies at a level of a few percent even on very large\nscales and need to be modelled properly if we want to extract high precision\ncosmological information from the upcoming galaxy surveys.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 May 2013 20:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-30"}

The new evidence for AGN photoionization, combined with\npreviously detected CIV and luminous, warm infrared emission, suggest that B1\nis the site of a hidden quasar. This is confirmed by the fact that [OII] is\nrelatively weak compared to [OIII] (extinction-corrected [OIII]/[OII] of about\n3.8), which is indicative of a high, Seyfert-like ionization parameter.

First,\nthe amplitude of scalar curvature perturbations is not directly tied to the\nshape of the inflationary potential. This allows the theory to violate na\\\"ive\nformulations of the Lyth bound. Second, the tensor sector of the theory is\nsignificantly altered from the usual case: the non-Abelian gauge field\nperturbations have a tensor degree of freedom.

In order to investigate\nfundamental kinematic properties we concentrate on non-interacting spiral\ngalaxies. We employ a simple parameterized form for the rotation curve in order\nto derive the three parameters: the maximum rotational velocity, the turnover\nradius and a measure of the slope of the rotation curve beyond the turnover\nradius. Our approach uses the statistical Hierarchical Clustering method to\nguide our division of the resultant 3D distribution of galaxies into five\nclasses. Comparing the kinematic classes in this preliminary classification\nscheme to a number of galaxy properties we find that our class containing\ngalaxies with the largest rotational velocities has a mean morphological type\nof Sb/Sbc while the other classes tend to later types. Other trends also\ngenerally agree with those described by previous researchers.

Our main\nconclusions are the following: the data reductions with the logarithmic laws\nshow strong dependence on the unknown energy scale involved, which is treated\nhere either as a free parameter or fixed at the energy threshold; the fit\nresults with the P law, the L2 law (free scale) and the Lgamma law (fixed scale\nand exponent gamma above 2) are all consistent within their uncertainties and\nwith the experimental data up to 7 TeV, but they partially underestimate the\nhigh-precision TOTEM measurement at 8 TeV; once compared with these results,\nthe L2 law with fixed scale is less consistent with the data and, in the case\nof a free scale, this pomeron contribution decreases as the energy increases\nbelow the scale factor (which lies above the energy cutoff); in all cases\ninvestigated, the predictions for the asymptotic ratio between the elastic and\ntotal cross-sections, within the uncertainties, do not exceed the value 0.430\n(therefore, below the black-disc limit) and the results favor rational limits\nbetween 1/3 and 2/5. We are led to conclude that the rise of the hadronic\ncross-sections at the highest energies still constitutes an open problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 May 2013 20:34:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 Sep 2013 19:51:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 29 Oct 2013 11:58:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-30"}

Using\nspherically symmetric simulations, we investigate how large-scale cooling flows\nare accreted by central supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in eight well-observed\nsystems and find an interesting dichotomy. In massive clusters, the gas\ndevelops a central cooling catastrophe within about the cooling time (typically\n~ 100 - 300 Myr), resulting in a cold-mode accretion onto SMBHs.

In our\nscheme, cooling occurs at the interface between the disc and the corona and it\nis triggered by positive supernova feedback. We combine hydrodynamical\nsimulations with a dynamical 3D model of the galactic fountain to predict the\nall-sky distribution of this cooling material, and we compare it with the\nobserved distribution of detections for different `warm' (SiIII, SiIV, CII,\nCIV) and `hot' (OVI) ionised species. The model reproduces the\nposition-velocity distribution and the column densities of the vast majority of\nwarm absorbers and about half of OVI absorbers. We conclude that the warm-hot\ngas responsible for most of the detections lies within a few kiloparsecs from\nthe Galactic plane, where high-metallicity material from the disc mixes\nefficiently with the hot corona. This process provides an accretion of a few\nMo/yr of fresh gas that can easily feed the star formation in the disc of the\nGalaxy.

We\nexamine this question, existing approaches, and present two novel families of\nsolutions, applicable in different settings. In particular, it is demonstrated\nthat a simple biologically plausible formula gives rise to an an unbiased (but\nnoisy) estimator of the gradient with respect to a binary stochastic neuron\nfiring probability. Unlike other estimators which view the noise as a small\nperturbation in order to estimate gradients by finite differences, this\nestimator is unbiased even without assuming that the stochastic perturbation is\nsmall. This estimator is also interesting because it can be applied in very\ngeneral settings which do not allow gradient back-propagation, including the\nestimation of the gradient with respect to future rewards, as required in\nreinforcement learning setups. We also propose an approach to approximating\nthis unbiased but high-variance estimator by learning to predict it using a\nbiased estimator. The second approach we propose assumes that an estimator of\nthe gradient can be back-propagated and it provides an unbiased estimator of\nthe gradient, but can only work with non-linearities unlike the hard threshold,\nbut like the rectifier, that are not flat for all of their range. This is\nsimilar to traditional sigmoidal units but has the advantage that for many\ninputs, a hard decision (e.g., a 0 output) can be produced, which would be\nconvenient for conditional computation and achieving sparse representations and\nsparse gradients.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 May 2013 00:29:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-15"}

Yet, advertisers are concerned\nabout the efficiency of their online advertising campaigns and consequently,\nwould like to restrict their ad impressions to certain websites and/or certain\ngroups of audience. These restrictions, known as targeting criteria, limit the\nreachability for better performance. This trade-off between reachability and\nperformance illustrates a need for a forecasting system that can quickly\npredict/estimate (with good accuracy) this trade-off. Designing such a system\nis challenging due to (a) the huge amount of data to process, and, (b) the need\nfor fast and accurate estimates.

The achievability is shown by a scheme that uses\nbeamforming to establish network coding on-the-fly at the relay in the uplink,\nand zero-forcing pre-coding in the downlink.

[Vibroacoustics of the piano soundboard:\n(Non)linearity and modal properties in the low- and mid- frequency ranges,\nJournal of Sound and Vibration 332 (5) (2013) 1288-1305]. The apparent modal\ndensity of the soundboard of an upright piano in playing condition, as seen\nfrom various points of the structure, exhibits two well-separated regimes,\nbelow and above a frequency flim that is determined by the wood characteristics\nand by the distance between ribs. Above flim, most modes appear to be\nlocalised, presumably due to the irregularity of the spacing and height of the\nribs. The low-frequency regime is predicted by a model which consists of\ncoupled sub-structures: the two ribbed areas split by the main bridge and, in\nmost cases, one or two so-called cut-off corners. In order to assess the\ndynamical properties of each of the subplates (considered here as homogeneous\nplates), we propose a derivation of the (low-frequency) modal density of an\northotropic homogeneous plate which accounts for the boundary conditions on an\narbitrary geometry. Above flim, the soundboard, as seen from a given excitation\npoint, is modelled as a set of three structural wave-guides, namely the three\ninter-rib spacings surrounding the excitation point. Based on these low- and\nhigh-frequency models, computations of the point-mobility and of the apparent\nmodal densities seen at several excitation points match published measurements.\nThe dispersion curve of the wave-guide model displays an acoustical radiation\nscheme which differs significantly from that of a thin homogeneous plate. It\nappears that piano dimensioning is such that the subsonic regime of acoustical\nradiation extends over a much wider frequency range than it would be for a\nhomogeneous plate with the same low-frequency vibration. One problem in piano\nmanufacturing is examined in relationship with the possible radiation schemes\ninduced by the models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 May 2013 08:29:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-04"}

These methods rely heavily on the downward-closure property (DCP) of\nthe support measure to ensure an efficient pruning of the candidate patterns.\nWhen switching to the emerging scenario of single-graph databases such as\nGoogle Knowledge Graph and Facebook social graph, the traditional support\nmeasure turns out to be trivial (either 0 or 1). However, to the best of our\nknowledge, all attempts to redefine a single-graph support resulted in measures\nthat either lose DCP, or are no longer semantically intuitive.\n  This paper targets mining patterns in the single-graph setting. We resolve\nthe \"DCP-intuitiveness\" dilemma by shifting the mining target from frequent\nsubgraphs to frequent neighborhoods. A neighborhood is a specific topological\npattern where a vertex is embedded, and the pattern is frequent if it is shared\nby a large portion (above a given threshold) of vertices. We show that the new\npatterns not only maintain DCP, but also have equally significant semantics as\nsubgraph patterns.

We show that, under certain conditions, for a specific\nsubset of the former solutions, the formation of trapped surfaces is prevented\nand thus the resulted singularity could be naked. The curvature singularity\nthat forms could be gravitationally strong in the sense of Tipler. Our\nnumerical analysis for the latter solutions shows that the collapsing dynamical\nprocess experiences four phases, so that two of which occur at the pre-bounce\nand the other two at post-bounce regimes.

This level is consistent with what has been measured previously\nfor this source in quiescence. However, on March 17 the source was found to\nhave an order of magnitude larger count rate.

This event was very likely due to a brief episode of low-level\naccretion onto the neutron star and provides further evidence that the\nquiescent state of neutron-star X-ray transients might not be as quiet as is\ngenerally assumed.

We produce a unified model\nthat can accurately match both observed effects using a single set of\nthermophysical properties derived from ground-based observations, and we\ndetermine Apollo's long term evolution. We use light-curve shape inversion\ntechniques and the ATPM on published light-curve, thermal-infrared, and radar\nobservations to constrain Apollo's thermophysical properties. The derived\nproperties are used to make detailed predictions of Apollo's Yarkovsky and YORP\neffects, which are then compared with published measurements of orbital drift\nand rotational acceleration. The ATPM explicitly incorporates 1D heat\nconduction, shadowing, multiple scattering of sunlight, global self-heating,\nand rough surface thermal-infrared beaming in the model predictions. We find\nthat ATPM can accurately reproduce the light-curve, thermal-infrared, and radar\nobservations of Apollo, and simultaneously match the observed orbital drift and\nrotational acceleration using: a shape model with axis ratios of\n1.94:1.65:1.00, an effective diameter of 1.55 +/- 0.07 km, a geometric albedo\nof 0.20 +/- 0.02, a thermal inertia of 140 +140/-100 J m-2 K-1 s-1/2, a highly\nrough surface, and a bulk density of 2850 +480/-680 kg m-3.

The inferred bulk\ndensity is consistent with those determined for other S-type asteroids, and\nsuggests that Apollo has a fractured interior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 May 2013 11:04:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

The main reason is that in case of constriction the current density is\nincreased over whole length and width of the constriction while in case of the\nturn the current density is enhanced only near the inner corner of the turn. It\nresults in inhomogeneous Joule heating near the turn and worsens the conditions\nfor appearance of the normal domain at relatively small currents when the\n\"high\" energy photons already could create normal domain in straight part of\nthe wire.

Edge-on spiral galaxies with prominent dust lanes provide us with an\nexcellent opportunity to study the distribution and properties of the dust\nwithin them. The HEROES project was set up to observe a sample of seven large\nedge-on galaxies across various wavelengths for this investigation.\n  Aims. Within this first paper, we present the Herschel observations and\nperform a qualitative and quantitative analysis on them, and we derive some\nglobal properties of the far infrared and submillimetre emission.\n  Methods. We determine horizontal and vertical profiles from the Herschel\nobservations of the galaxies in the sample and describe the morphology.\nModified black-body fits to the global fluxes, measured using aperture\nphotometry, result in dust temperatures and dust masses. The latter values are\ncompared to those that are derived from radiative transfer models taken from\nthe literature.\n  Results. On the whole, our Herschel flux measurements agree well with\narchival values. We find that the exponential horizontal dust distribution\nmodel often used in the literature generally provides a good description of the\nobserved horizontal profiles. Three out of the seven galaxies show signatures\nof extended vertical emission at 100 and 160 {\\mu}m at the 5{\\sigma} level, but\nin two of these it is probably due to deviations from an exactly edge-on\norientation. Only for NGC 4013, a galaxy in which vertically extended dust has\nalready been detected in optical images, we can detect vertically extended\ndust, and the derived scaleheight agrees with the value estimated through\nradiative transfer modelling. Our analysis hints at a correlation between the\ndust scaleheight and its degree of clumpiness, which we infer from the\ndifference between the dust masses as calculated from modelling of optical data\nand from fitting the spectral energy distribution of Herschel datapoints.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 May 2013 12:25:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

In the sliding motion of these surfaces the transition\nfrom stick-slip to continuous sliding is attained, whereby non-equilibrium\nphonon generation through sudden processes is suppressed. The adhesion and\ncorrugation strength continues to decrease upon insertion of the third graphene\nlayer and eventually saturates at a constant value with increasing number of\ngraphene layers.

We focus our attention on four\nkey Herbig Ae/Be stars to understand the structural properties responsible for\nthe absence of silicate feature emission. *Methods We investigate Q- and N-band\nimages taken with Subaru/COMICS, Gemini South/T-ReCS and VLT/VISIR. Our\nradiative transfer modeling solutions require a separation of inner- and outer-\ndisks by a large gap. From this we characterize the radial density structure of\ndust and PAHs in the disk. *Results The inner edge of the outer disk has a high\nsurface brightness and a typical temperature between ~100-150 K and therefore\ndominates the emission in the Q-band. We derive radii of the inner edge of the\nouter disk of 34, 23, 30 and 63 AU for HD97048, HD169142, HD135344B and Oph IRS\n48 respectively. For HD97048 this is the first detection of a disk gap. The\ncontinuum emission in the N-band is not due to emission in the wings of PAHs.\nThis continuum emission can be due to VSGs or to thermal emission from the\ninner disk. We find that PAH emission is not always dominated by PAHs on the\nsurface of the outer disk. *Conclusions. The absence of silicate emission\nfeatures is due to the presence of large gaps in the critical temperature\nregime. Many, if not all Herbig disks with Spectral Energy Distribution (SED)\nclassification `group I' are disks with large gaps and can be characterized as\n(pre-) transitional. An evolutionary path from the observed group I to the\nobserved group II sources seems no longer likely.

With minimal assumptions, we\nfind that UV behaviour leading to 2 spectral dimensions results in an exactly\nscale-invariant spectrum of vacuum scalar and tensor fluctuations, regardless\nof the equation of state. The fluctuation production mechanism is analogous to\nthe one known for varying speed of sound/light models and, unlike in inflation,\nthe spectrum is already scale-invariant before leaving the horizon, remaining\nso after freeze-in. In the light of Planck's recent results we also discuss\nscenarios that break exact scale-invariance, such as the possibility that the\nspectral dimension runs down to a value slightly higher than 2, or runs down to\n2 but with an extremely slow transient. We further show that the tensor to\nscalar ratio is fixed by the UV ratio between the speed of gravity and the\nspeed of light.

Many of the hallmarks of\ndynamic languages such as closures, continuations, various forms of reflection,\nand a lack of static types make many programmers rejoice, while compiler\nwriters, tool developers, and verification engineers lament. The dynamism of\nthese features simply confounds statically reasoning about programs that use\nthem. Consequently, static analyses for dynamic languages are few, far between,\nand seldom sound.\n  The \"abstracting abstract machines\" (AAM) approach to constructing static\nanalyses has recently been proposed as a method to ameliorate the difficulty of\ndesigning analyses for such language features. The approach, so called because\nit derives a function for the sound and computable approximation of program\nbehavior starting from the abstract machine semantics of a language, provides a\nviable approach to dynamic language analysis since all that is required is a\nmachine description of the interpreter.\n  The original AAM recipe produces finite state abstractions, which cannot\nfaithfully represent an interpreter's control stack. Recent advances have shown\nthat higher-order programs can be approximated with pushdown systems. However,\nthese automata theoretic models either break down on features that inspect or\nmodify the control stack.\n  In this paper, we tackle the problem of bringing pushdown flow analysis to\nthe domain of dynamic language features. We revise the abstracting abstract\nmachines technique to target the stronger computational model of pushdown\nsystems. In place of automata theory, we use only abstract machines and\nmemoization. As case studies, we show the technique applies to a language with\nclosures, garbage collection, stack-inspection, and first-class composable\ncontinuations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 May 2013 14:19:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 24 May 2013 12:36:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 29 Sep 2013 18:10:34 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 16 Oct 2013 18:47:21 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 27 Mar 2014 22:39:04 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Tue, 10 Jun 2014 16:10:10 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Wed, 6 Aug 2014 14:45:24 GMT"},{"version":"v8","created":"Thu, 14 Aug 2014 21:13:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-18"}

Thus, an\nunambiguous procedure should remove the equilibrium contributions, thereby\nrendering the nonequilibrium ones which are measurable and satisfy the\ngauge-invariant condition according to which expectation values of physical\nquantities should not change when electric potential everywhere is shifted by a\nconstant amount. Using the framework of nonequilibrium Green functions, we\ndelineate such procedure which yields the proper gauge-invariant nonequilibrium\ndensity matrix in the linear-response and elastic transport regime for\ncurrent-carrying steady state of an open quantum system connected to two\nmacroscopic reservoirs.
