Though existing techniques are\nquite effective for finding the shortest path on large but sparse road\nnetworks, social graphs have quite different characteristics: they are\ngenerally non-spatial, non-weighted, scale-free, and they exhibit small-world\nproperties in addition to their massive size. In particular, the existence of\nhubs, those vertices with a large number of connections, explodes the search\nspace, making the shortest path computation surprisingly challenging. In this\npaper, we introduce a set of novel techniques centered around hubs,\ncollectively referred to as the Hub-Accelerator framework, to compute the\nk-degree shortest path (finding the shortest path between two vertices if their\ndistance is within k). These techniques enable us to significantly reduce the\nsearch space by either greatly limiting the expansion scope of hubs (using the\nnovel distance- preserving Hub-Network concept) or completely pruning away the\nhubs in the online search (using the Hub2-Labeling approach).

At its\nsimplest, a growing tumor with increased proliferation capacity must compete\nfor space as a limited resource. Hypercellularity leads to a contact-inhibited\ncore with a competitive proliferating rim. Evolution and selection occurs, and\nan individual cell's capacity to survive and propagate is determined by its\ncombination of traits and interaction with the environment. With heterogeneity\nin phenotypes, the clone that will dominate is not always obvious as there are\nboth local interactions and global pressures. Several combinations of\nphenotypes can coexist, changing the fitness of the whole.\n  To understand some aspects of heterogeneity in a growing tumor we build an\noff-lattice agent based model consisting of individual cells with assigned\ntrait values for proliferation and migration rates. We represent heterogeneity\nin these traits with frequency distributions and combinations of traits with\ndensity maps. How the distributions change over time is dependent on how traits\nare passed on to progeny cells, which is our main inquiry.

Rather than solving the problem in\nparticular special cases, our work aims to provide universal lower bounds on\nthe revenue-to-welfare ratio that hold under the most general hypotheses that\nallow for non-trivial such bounds.\n  Our results can be summarized as follows. For general feasibility\nconstraints, the revenue-to-welfare ratio is at least a constant times the\ninverse-square-root of the number of agents, and this is tight up to constant\nfactors. For downward-closed feasibility constraints, the revenue-to-welfare\nratio is bounded below by a constant. Both results require the bidders'\ndistributions to satisfy hypotheses somewhat stronger than regularity; we show\nthat the latter result cannot avoid this requirement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 May 2013 18:54:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-03"}

We have\nacquired high-contrast imaging observations of this star using NIRC2 at Keck\nand report the direct detection of the body responsible for causing the\n\"trend\". HD 114174 B has a projected separation of 692+/-9 mas (18.1 AU) and is\n10.75+/-0.12 magnitudes (contrast of 5x10{-5}) fainter than its host in the\nK-band, requiring aggressive point-spread function subtraction to identify. Our\nastrometric time baseline of 1.4 years demonstrates physical association\nthrough common proper motion. We find that the companion has absolute\nmagnitude, M_J=13.97+/-0.11, and colors, J-K= 0.12+/-0.16 mag. These\ncharacteristics are consistent with an ~T3 dwarf, initially leading us to\nbelieve that HD 114174 B was a substellar object. However, a dynamical analysis\nthat combines radial velocity measurements with available imaging data\nindicates a minimum mass of m=0.260+/-0.010Msun. We conclude that HD 114174 B\nmust be a white dwarf. Assuming a hydrogen-rich composition, atmospheric and\nevolutionary model fits yield an effective temperature Teff = 8160+/-4000 K,\nsurface gravity log g=8.90+/-0.02, and cooling age of t_c=3.4 Gyr, which is\nconsistent with the 4.7+/-2.4 Gyr host star isochronal age estimate. HD 114174\nB is a benchmark object located only d=26.1 pc from the Sun. It may be studied\nat a level of detail comparable to Sirius and Procyon, and used to understand\nthe link between the mass of white dwarf remnants with that of their\nprogenitors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 May 2013 20:18:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Aug 2013 15:38:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

Most of these stars are fainter than 14th magnitude, in\ncontrast to other spectroscopic follow-up studies. This sample includes many\nhigh-priority Earth-sized candidate planets. A set of model spectra are fitted\nto R~3000 optical spectra of 268 stars to improve estimates of Teff, log(g),\nand [Fe/H] for the dwarfs in the range 4750K<Teff<7200K. These stellar\nproperties are used to find new stellar radii and, in turn, new radius\nestimates for the candidate planets. The result of improved stellar\ncharacteristics is a more accurate representation of this Kepler exoplanet\nsample and identification of promising candidates for more detailed study. This\nstellar sample, particularly among stars with Teff>5200K, includes a greater\nnumber of relatively evolved stars with larger radii than assumed by the\nmission on the basis of multi-color broadband photometry. About 26% of the\nmodelled stars require radii to be revised upwards by a factor of 1.35 or\ngreater, and modelling of 87% of the stars suggest some increase in radius. The\nsample presented here also exhibits a change in the incidence of planets larger\nthan 3-4 Earth radii as a function of metallicity. Once [Fe/H] increases to\n>=-0.05, large planets suddenly appear in the sample while smaller planets are\nfound orbiting stars with a wider range of metallicity. The modelled stellar\nspectra, as well as an additional 84 stars of mostly lower effective\ntemperatures, are made available to the community.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 May 2013 21:06:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

The coil power of the ICP system is\nused to tune the a-Si etch rate from 20 to 125 nm/min. The etch rates of a-Si,\nSiO2 and electroresist are measured depending on the SF6 ratio, platen power\nand chamber pressure and used to optimize the a-Si:SiO2 etch selectivity. The\nresults on nanostructures show that the presence of an insulating etch-stop\nlayer affects the passivation ratio required to achieve vertical sidewalls. A\nlow pressure is also necessary in order to etch the silicon nanostructure\nembedded into the oxide nanotrenches to form a highly conformable a-Si\nnanowire. We argue that both of these behaviors could be explained by surface\ncharging effects. Finally, etching of 20 nm a-Si nanowires that cross 15 nm\ntrenches in oxide with vertical sidewalls and a 4.3:1 a-Si:SiO2 etch\nselectivity is demonstrated.

The mechanism wishes to choose which agents to serve in order to maximize\nsocial efficiency, but is not willing to suffer an expected loss: the agents'\npayments should cover the cost of service in expectation.\n  We develop a general method for converting arbitrary approximation algorithms\nfor the underlying optimization problem into Bayesian incentive compatible\nmechanisms that are cost-recovering in expectation.

We\nquantify the morphology of the galaxies using the effective radius, reff, and\nS\\'ersic index, n. In both the cluster and field, approximately half of the\nbulge-dominated galaxies (n > 2) reside on the red sequence of the\ncolor-magnitude diagram, and most disk-dominated galaxies (n < 2) have colors\nexpected for star-forming galaxies. There is weak evidence that cluster\ngalaxies have redder rest-frame U - B colors and higher stellar masses compared\nto the field. Star-forming galaxies in both the cluster and field show no\nsignificant differences in their morphologies. In contrast, there is evidence\nthat quiescent galaxies in the cluster have larger median effective radii and\nsmaller S\\'ersic indices compared to the field with a significance of 2?. These\ndifferences are most pronounced for galaxies at clustercentric distances 1 Mpc\n< Rproj < 1.5 Mpc, which have low S\\'ersic indices and possibly larger\neffective radii, more consistent with star-forming galaxies at this epoch and\nin contrast to other quiescent galaxies. We argue that star-forming galaxies\nare processed under the influence of the cluster environment at distances\ngreater than the cluster-halo virial radius. Our results are consistent with\nmodels where gas accretion onto these galaxies is suppressed from processes\nassociated with the cluster environment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 May 2013 01:37:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

The central issue\nexamined is how the evolution of the ice area is treated when modeling a\npartial ice cover using a two-category-thickness scheme; thin sea ice and open\nwater in one category and \"thick\" sea ice in the second. The problem with the\nscheme is that the area-evolution is handled in a manner that violates the\nbasic rules of calculus, which leads to a neglected area-evolution term that is\nequivalent to neglecting a leading-order latent heat flux. We demonstrate the\nconsequences by constructing energy balance models with a fractional ice cover\nand studying them under the influence of increased radiative forcing. It is\nshown that the neglected flux is particularly important in a decaying ice cover\napproaching the transitions to seasonal or ice-free conditions. Clearly, a\nmishandling of the evolution of the ice area has leading-order effects on the\nice-albedo feedback.

This results in sparse system matrices and makes it computationally\nmore efficient than using the linear multistep version of CQ for TDBIE\ntime-stepping. We use a Volterra integral equation (VIE) to illustrate the\nderivation of this new approach: at time step $t_n = n h$ the VIE solution is\napproximated in a backwards-in-time manner in terms of basis functions $\\phi_j$\nby $u(t_n-t) \\approx \\sum_{j=0}^n u_{n-j}\\,\\phi_j(t/h)$ for $t \\in [0,t_n]$.

Our value for \\mu is five times more accurate and\nis 22% smaller than the best previous value \\mu=0.46(4) \\mu_B [S. Gerstenkorn\net al., J. Phys. (Paris) 35, 483 (1974)], while our value for Q is the same,\nbut 2.5 times more accurate than the 2011 result. A systematic study of\nhyperfine structure in eight other monovalent atoms supports our claim of 2%\nlevel uncertainty for $\\mu$ and Q in 229Th+3.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 May 2013 10:43:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

During each T1 cascade, the connected set of cells with\ndecreasing $Q$, called the \\textit{stress release domain}, is network-like and\nhighly non-local. Geometrically, the network-like nature of the stress release\ndomains is corroborated through morphological analysis using the Euler\ncharacteristic. The stress release domain is distinctly different from the set\nof cells that change topology during a T1 cascade. Our results highlight the\nunique rheological behavior of foams, where complex large-scale cooperative\nrearrangements of foam cells are observed as a consequence of distinctly local\nevents.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 May 2013 12:36:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

With known results on asymptotic zero\ndistribution of these polynomials and general theory on multiple orthogonal\npolynomial ensembles, it is then easy to obtain an explicit expression for the\ndistribution of squared singular values for the product of two complex random\nGaussian matrices in the limit of large matrix dimensions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 May 2013 14:43:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 Aug 2013 15:49:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

It is, for the understanding of\nuniverse, a simpler and more powerful tool than the big bang which requires\nquestionable supplements (dark matter, MOND, etc..). The Impulsive Stimulated\nRaman Scattering (ISRS) redshifts gradually light pulses which cross excited\natomic hydrogen H*, so that the redshift is a measure of the column density of\nH*. Thus, the distance of the hot stars, surrounded by much H*, is exaggerated\nby the use of Hubble's law. Local exaggerated distances create voids in the\nmaps of galaxies which become spongy. The interpretation of spectra of quasars,\nthe periodicity of galaxy redshifts introduce an experimental \"Karlsson's\nconstant\" exactly computed by ISRS. The need for dark matter comes from the\nexaggeration of the distance, therefore the size of galaxies. Without dark\nmatter, celestial mechanics provides a reliable distance of spiral galaxies.\nCoherence also introduces superradiance and mode competition that explain that\nonly the limbs of Str\\\"omgren spheres are visible as circles maybe punctuated\nby an even number of dots: Too numerous, the figures assigned to gravitational\nlenses can be such limbs.
