The present contribution\nthus aims at studying jointly selfsimilarity and anisotropy by focusing on a\nspecific classical class of Gaussian anisotropic selfsimilar processes. It will\nfirst be shown that accurate joint estimates of the anisotropy and\nselfsimilarity parameters are performed by replacing the standard 2D-discrete\nwavelet transform by the hyperbolic wavelet transform, which permits the use of\ndifferent dilation factors along the horizontal and vertical axis. Defining\nanisotropy requires a reference direction that needs not a priori match the\nhorizontal and vertical axes according to which the images are digitized, this\ndiscrepancy defines a rotation angle. Second, we show that this rotation angle\ncan be jointly estimated. Third, a non parametric bootstrap based procedure is\ndescribed, that provides confidence interval in addition to the estimates\nthemselves and enables to construct an isotropy test procedure, that can be\napplied to a single texture image. Fourth, the robustness and versatility of\nthe proposed analysis is illustrated by being applied to a large variety of\ndifferent isotropic and anisotropic self-similar fields. As an illustration, we\nshow that a true anisotropy built-in self-similarity can be disentangled from\nan isotropic self-similarity to which an anisotropic trend has been\nsuperimposed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 May 2013 17:56:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

However, inferring high quality customer social networks is a great\nchallenge while there are no explicit customer relations in many traditional\nOLTP environments. In this paper, we study this issue in the field of passenger\ntransport and introduce a new member to the family of social networks, which is\nnamed Co-Travel Networks, consisting of passengers connected by their co-travel\nbehaviors. We propose a novel method to infer high quality co-travel networks\nof civil aviation passengers from their co-booking behaviors derived from the\nPNRs (Passenger Naming Records).

The experimental results show the\neffectiveness of our inferring method, as well as some special characteristics\nof co-travel networks, such as the sparsity and high aggregation, compared with\nother kinds of social networks. It can be expected that such co-travel networks\nwill greatly help the industry to better understand their passengers so as to\nimprove their services.

Collective classification approaches exploit the dependencies of a\ngroup of linked objects whose class labels are correlated and need to be\npredicted simultaneously. In this paper, we focus on studying the collective\nclassification problem in heterogeneous networks, which involves multiple types\nof data objects interconnected by multiple types of links. Intuitively, two\nobjects are correlated if they are linked by many paths in the network.\nHowever, most existing approaches measure the dependencies among objects\nthrough directly links or indirect links without considering the different\nsemantic meanings behind different paths. In this paper, we study the\ncollective classification problem taht is defined among the same type of\nobjects in heterogenous networks. Moreover, by considering different linkage\npaths in the network, one can capture the subtlety of different types of\ndependencies among objects. We introduce the concept of meta-path based\ndependencies among objects, where a meta path is a path consisting a certain\nsequence of linke types. We show that the quality of collective classification\nresults strongly depends upon the meta paths used. To accommodate the large\nnetwork size, a novel solution, called HCC (meta-path based Heterogenous\nCollective Classification), is developed to effectively assign labels to a\ngroup of instances that are interconnected through different meta-paths. The\nproposed HCC model can capture different types of dependencies among objects\nwith respect to different meta paths. Empirical studies on real-world networks\ndemonstrate that effectiveness of the proposed meta path-based collective\nclassification approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 May 2013 04:05:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-21"}

Even\nthe correspondence between theory and reality is at stake here, since numerous\nreal materials show SSB in their ground states (or equilibrium states at low\ntemperature), although they are finite. Thus against what is sometimes called\n`Earman's Principle', a genuine physical effect (viz. SSB) seems theoretically\nrecovered only in some idealization (namely the thermodynamic limit),\ndisappearing as soon as the the idealization is removed. We review the\nwell-known arguments that (at first sight) no finite system can exhibit SSB,\nusing the formalism of algebraic quantum theory in order to control the\nthermodynamic limit and unify the description of finite- and infinite-volume\nsystems. Using the striking mathematical analogy between the thermodynamic\nlimit and the classical limit, we show that a similar situation obtains in\nquantum mechanics (which typically forbids SSB) versus classical mechanics\n(which allows it). This discrepancy between formalism and reality is quite\nsimilar to the measurement problem, and hence we address it in the same way,\nadapting an argument of the author and Reuvers (2013) that was originally\nintended to explain the collapse of the wave-function within conventional\nquantum mechanics. Namely, exponential sensitivity to (asymmetric)\nperturbations of the (symmetric) dynamics as the system size increases causes\nsymmetry breaking already in finite but very large quantum systems. This\nprovides continuity between finite- and infinite-volume descriptions of quantum\nsystems featuring SSB and hence restores Earman's Principle (at least in this\nparticularly threatening case).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 May 2013 09:35:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 2 Aug 2013 09:58:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-05"}

This allows to predict self-consistently: (i) the effective temperature,\nand more generally the convective envelope and atmosphere structures, correctly\ncoupled to the changes in the surface chemical abundances and gas opacities;\n(ii) sphericity effects in the atmospheres; (iii) the core mass-luminosity\nrelation and its break-down due to hot bottom burning (HBB) in the most massive\nAGB stars, (iv) the HBB nucleosynthesis via the solution of a complete nuclear\nnetwork (pp chains, and the CNO, NeNa, MgAl cycles), including also the\nproduction of 7Li via the Cameron-Fowler beryllium transport mechanism; (v) the\nchemical composition of the pulse-driven convective zone; (vi) the onset and\nquenching of the third dredge-up, with a suitable temperature criterion.

The observed abundance pattern in the ejecta components\nis in good agreement with that predicted by a standard model of Type Ia\nsupernovae (SNe). The spatially resolved analysis reveals that the distribution\nof the O-burning and incomplete Si-burning products (Si, S, and Ar) is\nasymmetric, while that of the C-burning products (O, Ne, and Mg) is relatively\nuniform in the SNR interior. The peak position of the former is clearly shifted\nby 5' (~3.2 pc at a distance of 2.2 kpc) to the southeast from the SNR's\ngeometric center.

The difference is mainly due to the background evolution, driven\nmostly by the normalization of the power spectrum today. The dark energy\nperturbations make only a small contribution on the largest scales, and a\nnegligible contribution on smaller scales.

The analysis focused on the stability of selection\nbecause, although it is necessary for determining the significance of results,\nit is often ignored in similar studies.\n  The comparison of post-selection accuracy in the validation of Random Forest\nclassifiers revealed that all investigated methods were equivalent in this\ncontext.
