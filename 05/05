This additional\ngain is shown to be much larger than the one from the same populations when\nobserved over different areas of the sky (with twice the combined area). The\ntotal improvement of ~5 implies that a photometric survey such as the Dark\nEnergy Survey should be able to recover \\gamma at the 5-10% from the angular\nclustering in linear scales of two different tracers. It can also constrain the\nevolution of f(z)x\\sigma_8(z) in few bins beyond z~0.8-0.9 at the 10-15% level\nper-bin, compatible with recent constrains from lower-z spectroscopic surveys.\nWe also show how further improvement can be achieved by reducing the\nphotometric redshift error.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 May 2013 16:40:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 May 2013 08:37:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 7 Nov 2014 01:25:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-10"}

How much dependence is there in the\ndecomposition into cycles of a random permutation of n points? What is the\nrelation between the Poisson-Dirichlet process and the scale invariant Poisson\nprocess? These three questions have essentially the same answers, with respect\nto total variation distance, considering only small components, and with\nrespect to a Wasserstein distance, considering all components. The Wasserstein\ndistance is the expected number of changes -- insertions and deletions --\nneeded to change the dependent system into an independent system.\n  In particular we show that for primes, roughly speaking, 2+o(1) changes are\nnecessary and sufficient to convert a uniformly distributed random integer from\n1 to n into a random integer prod_{p leq n} p^{Z_p} in which the multiplicity\nZ_p of the factor p is geometrically distributed, with all Z_p independent. The\nchanges are, with probability tending to 1, one deletion, together with a\nrandom number of insertions, having expectation 1+o(1).\n  The crucial tool for showing that 2+epsilon suffices is a coupling of the\ninfinite independent model of prime multiplicities, with the scale invariant\nPoisson process on (0,infty). A corollary of this construction is the first\nmetric bound on the distance to the Poisson-Dirichlet in Billingsley's 1972\nweak convergence result. Our bound takes the form: there are couplings in which\n  E sum |log P_i(n) - (log n) V_i | = O(\\log \\log n), where P_i denotes the\ni-th largest prime factor and V_i denotes the i-th component of the\nPoisson-Dirichlet process.

One reason for the high cost of backhaul\nis that capacity is often purchased on leased lines with guaranteed rates\nprovisioned to peak loads. In this paper, we present an alternate\n\\emph{opportunistic backhaul} model where third parties provide base stations\nand backhaul connections and lease out excess capacity in their networks to the\ncellular provider when available, presumably at significantly lower costs than\nguaranteed connections. We describe a scalable architecture for such\ndeployments using open access femtocells, which are small plug-and-play base\nstations that operate in the carrier's spectrum but can connect directly into\nthe third party provider's wired network. Within the proposed architecture, we\npresent a general user association optimization algorithm that enables the\ncellular provider to dynamically determine which mobiles should be assigned to\nthe third-party femtocells based on the traffic demands, interference and\nchannel conditions and third-party access pricing. Although the optimization is\nnon-convex, the algorithm uses a computationally efficient method for finding\napproximate solutions via dual decomposition. Simulations of the deployment\nmodel based on actual base station locations are presented that show that large\ncapacity gains are achievable if adoption of third-party, open access\nfemtocells can reach even a small fraction of the current market penetration of\nWiFi access points.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 May 2013 20:51:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-07"}

Decoherence dynamics can be put in evidence by means of\nrefocusing experiments of the dipolar interactions. The experimental technique\nused in this work is based on the MREV8 pulse sequence. The aim of the work is\nto detect the main features of the Irreversible Quantum Decoherence (IQD) in\nLC, on the basis of the theory presented by the authors recently. The focus is\nlaid on experimentally probing the eigen-selection process in the intermediate\ntime scale, between quantum interference of a closed system and thermalization,\nas a signature of the IQD of the open quantum system, as well as on quantifying\nthe effects of non-idealities as possible sources of signal decays which could\nmask the intrinsic IQD. In order to contrast experiment and theory, the theory\nwas adapted to obtain the IQD function corresponding to the MREV8 reversion\nexperiments. Non-idealities of the experimental setting are analysed in detail\nwithin this framework and their effects on the observed signal decay are\nnumerically estimated. It is found that, though these non-idealities could in\nprinciple affect the evolution of the spin dynamics, their influence can be\nmitigated and they do not present the characteristic behavior of the IQD. As\nunique characteristic of the IQD, the experimental results clearly show the\noccurrence of eigen-selectivity in the intermediate timescale, in complete\nagreement with the theoretical predictions. We conclude that the\neigen-selection effect is the fingerprint of IQD associated with a quantum open\nspin system in LC. Besides, these features of the results account for the\nquasi-equilibrium states of the spin system, which were observed previously in\nthese mesophases, and lead to conclude that the quasi-equilibrium is a definite\nstage of the spin dynamics during its evolution towards equilibrium\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 May 2013 00:40:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Sep 2013 04:55:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-24"}

Crack initiation and subsequent propagation -- the dynamic\nprocess of fracture -- couples a wide range of time and length scales. Crack\ndynamics challenge our understanding of the fundamental physics processes that\ntake place in the extreme conditions within the nearly singular region where\nmaterial failure occurs. Here, we first briefly review the classic approach to\ndynamic fracture, \"Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics\" (LEFM), and discuss its\nsuccesses and limitations. We show how, on the one hand, recent experiments\nperformed on straight cracks propagating in soft brittle materials have\nquantitatively confirmed the predictions of this theory to an unprecedented\ndegree. On the other hand, these experiments show how LEFM breaks down as the\nsingular region at the tip of a crack is approached. This breakdown naturally\nleads to a new theoretical framework coined \"Weakly Nonlinear Fracture\nMechanics\", where weak elastic nonlinearities are incorporated. The stronger\nsingularity predicted by this theory gives rise to a new and intrinsic length\nscale, $\\ell_{nl}$. These predictions are verified in detail through direct\nmeasurements. We then theoretically and experimentally review how the emergence\nof $\\ell_{nl}$ is linked to a new equation for crack motion, which predicts the\nexistence of a high-speed oscillatory crack instability whose wave-length is\ndetermined by $\\ell_{nl}$.

The effective\nmedium in the present version of the CPA is not a lattice but a homogeneous and\nisotropic medium, representing an amorphous material on a mesoscopic scale. The\ntransition from a frequency-independent to a frequency-dependent diffusivity\n(conductivity) is shown to correspond to the boson peak in the vibrational\nmodel. The anomalous regimes above the crossover are governed by a complex,\nfrequency-dependent self energy. The boson peak is shown to be stronger for\nnon-Gaussian disorder than for Gaussian disorder.

We have performed global two-dimensional\nradiaion-magnetohydrodynamic simulations of supercritical accretion flow onto a\nblack hole with 10 or 10^8 solar masses in a large simulation box of 514 r_S x\n514 r_S (with r_S being the Schwarzschild radius). We confirm that uncollimated\noutflows with velocities of 10 percents of the speed of light emerge from the\ninnermost part of the accretion flow over wide angles of 10 - 50 degree from\nthe disk rotation axis. Importantly, the outflows exhibit clumpy structure\nabove heights of ~ 250 r_S. The typical size of the clumps is ~ 10 r_S, which\ncorresponds to one optical depth, and their shapes are slightly elongated along\nthe outflow direction. Since clumps start to form in the layer above which\n(upward) radiation force overcomes (downward) gravity force, Rayleigh-Taylor\ninstability seems to be of primary cause. In addition, a radiation hydrodynamic\ninstability, which arises when radiation funnels through radiation-pressure\nsupported atmosphere, may also help forming clumps of one optical depth.\nMagnetic photon bubble instability seems not to be essential, since similar\nclumpy outflow structure is obtained in non-magnetic radiation-hydrodynamic\nsimulations. Since the spatial covering factor of the clumps is estimated to be\n~ 0.3 and since they are marginally optically thick, they will explain at least\nsome of rapid light variations of active galactic nuclei.
