Initially, the LQG flux-holonomy variables\nare treated as classical, commuting functions rather than quantized operators,\nin a limit where variation from vertex to vertex are small and fields are weak.\nDespite the weakness of the fields, the field equations are not linear. Also,\nthe theory can be quantized, and the expectation values of the quantum\noperators behave like their classical analogs. Exact LQG theories may be either\nlocal or non-local. The present paper argues that a wide class of non-local\ntheories share non-local features which survive to the semiclassical limit, and\nthese non-local features are included in the classical limit studied here. An\nappendix computes the surface term required when the propagation direction is\nthe real line rather than $\\mathrm{S}_1$. Paper II introduces coherent states,\nconstructs a damped sine wave solution to the constraints, and solves for the\nbehavior of the holonomies in the presence of the wave.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 May 2013 16:01:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Nov 2014 22:07:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-12"}

Using 130 time-resolved\ncircular polarisation spectra, obtained with the MuSiCoS spectropolarimeter at\nthe 2m TBL from 1998 until 2005, we applied the least-squares deconvolution\nmethod on the Stokes V spectra and derived the longitudinal component of the\nintegrated magnetic field over the visible hemisphere of the star. We performed\na period analysis on the magnetic data and on EW measurements of UV wind lines\nobtained over 17 years. We also analysed the short- and long-term radial\nvelocity variations, which are due to the pulsations and the 90-year binary\nmotion. beta Cep hosts a sinusoidally varying magnetic field with an amplitude\n97(4) G and an average value -6(3) G. From the UV wind line variability, we\nderive a period of 12.00075(11) days, which is the rotation period of the star,\nand is compatible with the observed magnetic modulation. Phases of maximum and\nminimum field match those of maximum emission in the UV wind lines, strongly\nsupporting an oblique magnetic-rotator model.

It involves strong field ionization of the molecule by\nthe IR laser field followed by time-delayed recombination of the removed\nelectron with the molecular ion. The time-delay is controlled on the attosecond\ntime scale by the oscillation of the IR field and is mapped into the harmonic\nnumber, providing a movie of molecular dynamics between ionization and\nrecombination. One of the challenges in the analysis of high harmonic signal\nstems from the fact that the complex dynamics of both ionization and\nrecombination with their multiple observables are entangled in the harmonic\nsignal. Disentangling this information requires multidimensional approach,\ncapable of mapping ionization and recombination dynamics into different\nindependent parameters. We suggest multidimensional high harmonic spectroscopy\nas a tool for characterizing of ionization and recombination processes\nseparately allowing for simultaneous detection of both the ionization delays\nand sub-cycle ionization rates. Our method extends the capability of the two\ndimensional (2D) set-up suggested recently by Shafir et al on reconstructing\nionization delays, while keeping the reconstruction procedure as simple as in\nthe original proposal. The scheme is based on the optimization of the high\nharmonic signal in orthogonally polarized strong fundamental and relatively\nweak multicolour control fields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 May 2013 18:09:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 25 Jun 2013 07:48:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-08"}

In this picture, unlike the Standard Model, the\nsymmetry is not only left-right symmetric, but each left handed fermion\nmultiplet is accompanied by new right handed fermion multiplet of opposite\nchirality. In this work, we consider a gauge symmetry, $SU(3)_c \\otimes\nSU(2)_L\\otimes SU(2)_R \\otimes U(1)_{Y^\\prime}$ supplemented by a discrete\n$Z_2$ symmetry. Instead of having right handed multiplets for each left handed\nmultiplets of the same fermions as in the usual left-right model, the mirror\nmodel include right handed doublets involving new fermions (called mirrors),\nand similarly for each right handed singlet, there are corresponding mirror\nsinglets. Thus the gauge anomaly is naturally absent in this model, and the\nmodel also provide a solution for the strong CP problem because of parity\nconservation. The first stage of symmetry breaking is achieved by a doublet\nmirror Higgs with a vacuum expectation value $\\simeq 10^7$ GeV, needed to\nexplain the neutrino mass $\\simeq 10^{-11}$ GeV.

In contrast, the\nmethod proposed in this paper is aimed at stabilizing the origin of an error\nsystem characterized by the difference between the inner loop state and the\nstate specified by a full-order reference model. This makes the method\napplicable to systems with reduced levels of time scale separation.

The effectiveness of the proposed reference\nmodel-based strategy is shown through simulation on an existing stirred tank\nreactor problem, where we demonstrate that the MPC optimization problem remains\nfeasible and that the system remains stable and continues to perform well when\ntime scale separation between the inner and outer loops is reduced.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 May 2013 00:47:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 Jul 2013 04:15:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 23 Sep 2013 02:01:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-24"}

We study\nthe static behavior of an anisotropic trap, where anisotropy results\nessentially from the use of two different laser frequencies for the arms of the\ntrap. Such a trap has very surprising behaviors, in particular the cloud\ndisappears for some laser frequencies, while it exists for smaller and larger\nfrequencies. A model is build to explain these behaviors. We show in particular\nthat, to reproduce the experimental observations, the model has to take into\naccount the cross saturation effects.

The latter's approach to the\nthree-body-problem has often been celebrated as a starting point of chaos\ntheory in relation to the investigation of dynamical systems. Yet, the novelty\nof Poincar\\'e's strategy can also be analyzed as having been cast out some\nspecific algebraic practices for manipulating systems of linear equations. As\nthe structure of a cast-iron building may be less noticeable than its creative\nfa\\c{c}ade, the algebraic cast of Poincar\\'e's strategy was broken out of the\nmold in generating the new methods of celestial mechanics. But as the various\ncomponents that are mixed in some casting process can still be detected in the\nresulting alloy, this algebraic cast points to some collective dimensions of\nthe M\\'ethodes nouvelles. It thus allow to analyze Poincar\\'e's individual\ncreativity in regard with the collective dimensions of some algebraic cultures.\nAt a global scale, Poincar\\'e's strategy is a testimony of the pervading\ninfluence of what used to play the role of a shared algebraic culture in the\n19th century, i.e., much before the development of linear algebra as a specific\ndiscipline. This shared culture was usually identified by references to the\n''equation to the secular inequalities in planetary theory.'' This form of\nidentification highlights the long shadow of the great treatises of mechanics\npublished at the end of the 18th century. At a more local scale, Poincar\\'e's\napproach can be analyzed in regard with the specific evolution that Hermite's\nalgebraic theory of forms impulsed to the culture of the secular equation.\nMoreover, this papers shows that some specific aspects of Poincar\\'e's own\ncreativity result from a process of acculturation of the latter to Jordan's\npractices of reductions of linear substitutions within the local algebraic\nculture anchored in Hermite's legacy .\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 May 2013 07:15:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-14"}

A huge quantity of information is pouring\nin from various sources. The revolutionary advancement of Information and\nCommunication technologies bring the world close together. A pile of\ninformation in different formats is just a click away. Which motivate the\norganizations to get more internet bandwidth to consume and publish the\ninformation over exploding cloud of Internet. The standard router redundancy\nprotocol is used to handle backup links however it cannot aggregate them.\nWhereas the link standard aggregation protocol can aggregate the link but it\nsupport only Ethernet technology. In this research paper a concept of Redundant\nLink Aggregation (RLA) is proposed. RLA can aggregate and handle backup links\nwith main links regardless of carrier technology. Furthermore a data forwarding\nmechanism Odd Load Balancing (OLB) is also proposed for RLA scheme. For the\nsake of performance evaluation, Redundant Link Aggregation (RLA) is compared\nwith Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP). The simulation result reveals\nthat Redundant Link Aggregation (RLA) can cover the bandwidth demand of the\nnetwork in peak hours by consuming backup links as well which with Virtual\nRouter Redundancy Protocol (VRRP) cannot. It is further noted that Odd Load\nBalancing (OLB) feature can be used to save the cost in terms of money per\nannum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 May 2013 08:53:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-14"}

In this paper, we focus on the \"structured denoising\nproblem\", where the signal $x_0$ possesses a certain structure and $z$ has\nindependent normally distributed entries with mean zero and variance\n$\\sigma^2$. We employ a structure-inducing convex function $f(\\cdot)$ and solve\n$\\min_x\\{\\frac{1}{2}\\|y-x\\|_2^2+\\sigma\\lambda f(x)\\}$ to estimate $x_0$, for\nsome $\\lambda>0$. Common choices for $f(\\cdot)$ include the $\\ell_1$ norm for\nsparse vectors, the $\\ell_1-\\ell_2$ norm for block-sparse signals and the\nnuclear norm for low-rank matrices. The metric we use to evaluate the\nperformance of an estimate $x^*$ is the normalized mean-squared-error\n$\\text{NMSE}(\\sigma)=\\frac{\\mathbb{E}\\|x^*-x_0\\|_2^2}{\\sigma^2}$. We show that\nNMSE is maximized as $\\sigma\\rightarrow 0$ and we find the \\emph{exact} worst\ncase NMSE, which has a simple geometric interpretation: the\nmean-squared-distance of a standard normal vector to the $\\lambda$-scaled\nsubdifferential $\\lambda\\partial f(x_0)$. When $\\lambda$ is optimally tuned to\nminimize the worst-case NMSE, our results can be related to the constrained\ndenoising problem $\\min_{f(x)\\leq f(x_0)}\\{\\|y-x\\|_2\\}$. The paper also\nconnects these results to the generalized LASSO problem, in which, one solves\n$\\min_{f(x)\\leq f(x_0)}\\{\\|y-Ax\\|_2\\}$ to estimate $x_0$ from noisy linear\nobservations $y=Ax_0+z$. We show that certain properties of the LASSO problem\nare closely related to the denoising problem.

The\nmulti-component fluid theory is used to describe the IA wave susceptibility for\nexcitation in inhomogeneous plasmas and its coupling with electromagnetic\nwaves.

The basic algebraic\nenvironment we work in is the a semifield of fractions H(x1,...,xn) of the\npolynomial semidomain H[x1,...,xn], where H is taken to be an idempotent\nsemifield, while for the geometric environment we have the space H^n. We show\nthat taking H to be idempotent makes both H(x1,...,xn) and Hn idempotent which\nturn out to satisfy many desired properties that we utilize for our\nconstruction. The fundamental algebraic and geometric objects having\ninterrelations are called kernels, encapsulating congruences over semifields\nand skeletons which serve as the analog for zero-sets of algebraic geometry. As\nan analog for the celebrated Nullstellenzats theorem, we develop a\ncorrespondence between skeletons and a family of kernels called polars\noriginally developed in the theory of lattice-ordered groups. For a special\nkind of skeletons, called principal skeletons, we have simplified the\ncorrespondence by restricting our algebraic environment to a certain kernel of\nH(x1,...,xn). After establishing the linkage between kernels and skeletons we\nproceed to construct a second linkage, this time between a family of skeletons\nand what we call \"corner-loci\".

A skeleton and a corner-locus define\nthe exact same subset of H^n in different ways: while a corner locus is defined\nby corner roots of tropical polynomials, the skeleton is defined by equating\nfractions from H(x1,...,xn) to 1.

For both\ngeometries, the permittivity components differ from each other in the radial\nand tangential directions. We show that choosing the ratio between these\ncomponents in a certain way, these rather simple structures can be used in\ncloaking dielectric inclusions with arbitrary permittivity and shape in the\nquasi-static limit. For an ideal cloak, the contrast between the permittivity\ncomponents has to tend to infinity. However, only positive permittivity values\nare required and a notable cloaking effect can already be observed with\nrelatively moderate permittivity contrasts. Furthermore, we show that the\npolarly anisotropic cylindrical shell has a complementary capability of\nmagnifying the response of an inner cylinder.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 May 2013 07:09:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 Jun 2013 06:41:04 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 5 Aug 2013 10:40:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-06"}

Part II: Synthetic master events","comments":null,"journal-ref":null,"doi":null,"report-no":null,"categories":"physics.geo-ph physics.soc-ph","license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","abstract":"  Waveform cross correlation is an efficient tool for detection and\ncharacterization of seismic signals. The efficiency critically depends on the\navailability of master events. For the purposes of the Comprehensive\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, cross correlation can globally reduce the threshold\nmonitoring by 0.3 to 0.4 magnitude units. In seismically active regions, the\noptimal choice of master events is straightforward. There are two approaches to\npopulate the global grid in aseismic areas: the replication of real masters and\nsynthetic seismograms calculated for seismic arrays of the International\nMonitoring System. Synthetic templates depend on the accuracy of shape and\namplitude predictions controlled by focal depth and mechanism, source function,\nvelocity structure and attenuation along the master/station path. As in Part I,\nwe test three focal mechanisms (explosion, thrust fault, and actual Harvard CMT\nsolution for one of the April 11, 2012 Sumatera aftershocks) and two velocity\nstructures (ak135 and CRUST 2.0). Sixteen synthetic master events were\ndistributed over a 1ox1o grid. We built five cross correlation standard event\nlists (XSEL) and compared detections and events with those built using the real\nand grand master events as well as with the Reviewed Event Bulletin of the\nInternational Data Centre. The XSELs built using the source of explosion and\nak135 and the reverse fault with isotropic radiation pattern demonstrate the\nperformance similar to that of the real and grand masters. Therefore, it is\npossible to cover all aseismic areas with synthetic masters without significant\nloss in seismic monitoring capabilities based on cross correlation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 May 2013 19:06:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-15"}

In other words, a small von Neumann Jordan constant E + 1 for\nX yields a small Banach-Mazur distance with R^n, d(X, R^n) < 1 + B_n E +\nO(E^2).

An example for a\npattern is a time-series representing a heart rate during a specific\ntime-range, wherein the time-series is a sequence of data points that represent\nthe changes in the heart rate values. A bio-medical simulator system was\ndeveloped to acquire a collection of 7,871 price patterns of financial\ninstruments. The financial instruments traded in real-time on three American\nstock exchanges, NASDAQ, NYSE, and AMEX, simulate bio-medical measurements. The\nsystem simulates a human in which each price pattern represents one bio-medical\nsensor. Data provided during trading hours from the stock exchanges allowed\nreal-time classification. Classification is based on new machine learning\ntechniques: self-labeling, which allows the application of supervised learning\nmethods on unlabeled time-series and similarity ranking, which applied on a\ndecision tree learning algorithm to classify time-series regardless of type and\nquantity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 May 2013 22:00:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-04"}
