The problem is often formulated using Bayes theorem and\nthe multinomial distribution, along with a constant prior for the values of the\np_i, leading to a Dirichlet distribution for the {p_i}.

It was recently discovered that the symmetry of such a system allows\nfor interesting Rashba spin-orbit effects. A perpendicular electric field is\nable to couple to the sublattice pseudospin, making it possible to electrically\ntune and close the band gap. Therefore, external electric fields may generate a\ntopological phase transition from a topological insulator to a normal insulator\n(or semimetal) and vice versa. The contribution of the present article to the\nstudy of silicene is twofold: First, we perform a group theoretical analysis to\nsystematically construct the Hamiltonian in the vicinity of the $K$ points of\nthe Brillouin zone and discover a new, but symmetry allowed term. Subsequently,\nwe identify a tight binding model that corresponds to the group theoretically\nderived Hamiltonian near the $K$ points. Second, we start from this tight\nbinding model to analyze the topological phase diagram of silicene by an\nexplicit calculation of the $Z_2$ topological invariant of the band structure.\nTo this end, we calculate the $Z_2$ topological invariant of the honeycomb\nlattice in a manifestly gauge invariant way which allows us to include $S_z$\nsymmetry breaking terms -- like Rashba spin orbit interaction -- into the\ntopological analysis. Interestingly, we find that the interplay of two Rashba\nterms can generate a non-trivial quantum spin Hall phase in silicene. This is\nin sharp contrast to the more extensively studied honeycomb system graphene\nwhere Rashba spin orbit interaction is known to compete with the quantum spin\nHall effect in a potentially detrimental way.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 May 2013 16:28:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 2 Sep 2013 07:33:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

We accomplish this in a 1+1D simulation by calculating\nmagnetic diffusivities and utilizing turbulence activity criteria to determine\nthermal structure and accretion rate without resorting to a 3-D\nmagnetohydrodynamical (MHD) simulation. Our major findings are as follows.\nFirst, even for modest surface densities of just a few times the minimum-mass\nsolar nebula, the dead zone encompasses the giant planet-forming region,\npreserving any compositional gradients. Second, the surface density of the\nactive layer is nearly constant in time at roughly 10 g/cm2, which we use to\nderive a simple prescription for viscous heating in MRI-active disks for those\nwho wish to avoid detailed MHD computations. Furthermore, unlike a standard\ndisk with constant-alpha viscosity, the disk midplane does not cool off over\ntime, though the surface cools as the star evolves along the Hayashi track. The\nice line is firmly in the terrestrial planet-forming region throughout disk\nevolution and can move either inward or outward with time, depending on whether\npileups form near the star. Finally, steady-state mass transport is a poor\ndescription of flow through an MRI-active disk.

These\nrequirements and their justification are fully discussed. In the second\nquantisation approach used, both the system and the sub-systems are modes (or\nsets of modes) rather than particles, particles being associated with different\noccupancies of the modes. The definition of entangled states is based on first\ndefining the non-entangled states - after specifying which modes constitute the\nsub-systems. This paper mainly focuses on two mode entanglement for massive\nbosons. Several inequalities involving variances and mean values of operators\ninvolving mode annihilation, creation operators have been proposed as tests for\ntwo mode entangled states, including the inequalities that define spin\nsqueezing. Spin squeezing criteria in two mode systems are examined, and spin\nsqueezing is best considered for principle spin operator components where the\ncovariance matrix is diagonal. It is shown that the presence of spin squeezing\nin at least one of the spin components requires entanglement of the relevant\npair of modes. Several of the other proposed tests for entanglement, including\nones based on the sum of the variances for two spin components are considered.\nAll of the tests are still valid when the present concept of entanglement based\non the symmetrisation and super-selection rule criteria is applied, but further\ntests have been obtained here.

However, the LHC experiments have\nfound no scalar-quarks or gluinos in such mass range, and moreover, the Higgs\nboson mass of 126 GeV requires, within the MSSM framework, the scalar-top mass\nof order 1-10 TeV. This current status forces us to abandon the simplest\nsupersymmetry-breaking frameworks of the CMSSM and the GMSB scenarios.\n  The V-MSSM is investigated in this dissertation, which is proposed as an\nextension of the MSSM with a (10 + 10bar) pair of the SU(5) decuplets. In the\nframework the Higgs mass is increased by effect from the extra matters, and\nthus the 126 GeV is achieved with the scalar-top having a lighter mass. This\nfact resurrects the CMSSM and the GMSB scenarios. This dissertation examines\nthe GMSB scenario under the V-MSSM; it is called V-GMSB scenario.\n  It is shown that the V-GMSB has a potential to realize the 126 GeV mass of\nthe Higgs boson with holding the explanation of the muon magnetic moment\ndiscrepancy, if the masses of the extra quarks are approximately less than 1.2\nTeV. Constraints on the V-GMSB from the LHC experiments are discussed then; it\nis concluded that the gluino mass must be approximately heavier than 1.1 TeV,\nand that the extra quarks be heavier than 300-650 GeV depending on the decay\nbranches of them.\n  LHC prospects are briefly discussed. As the extra quarks are expected to be\napproximately less than 1.2 TeV, searches for the particles are of great\ninterest at the 14 TeV LHC; constraints from the supersymmetry search,\nespecially on the gluino mass, are expected to be much improved there.\nTherefore, it is expected that the fate of the V-GMSB is adjudicated at the\ncourt of the 14 TeV LHC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 May 2013 18:11:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-06"}

We investigate how the\nfollowing factors affect the resulting $n_{\\rm eff}$ of the survey with\ndetailed simulations: (1) survey time, (2) shear measurement algorithm, (3)\nalgorithm for combining multiple exposures, (4) inclusion of data from multiple\nfilter bands, (5) redshift distribution of the galaxies, and (6) masking and\nblending. For the first time, we quantify in a general weak lensing analysis\npipeline the sensitivity of $n_{\\rm eff}$ to the above factors.\n  We find that with current weak lensing algorithms, expected distributions of\nobserving parameters, and all lensing data ($r$- and $i$-band, covering 18,000\ndegree$^{2}$ of sky) for LSST, $n_{\\rm eff} \\approx37$ arcmin$^{-2}$ before\nconsidering blending and masking, $n_{\\rm eff} \\approx31$ arcmin$^{-2}$ when\nrejecting seriously blended galaxies and $n_{\\rm eff} \\approx26$ arcmin$^{-2}$\nwhen considering an additional 15% loss of galaxies due to masking. With future\nimprovements in weak lensing algorithms, these values could be expected to\nincrease by up to 20%. Throughout the paper, we also stress the ways in which\n$n_{\\rm eff}$ depends on our ability to understand and control systematic\neffects in the measurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 May 2013 18:24:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 16 Jun 2013 16:33:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 30 Oct 2014 08:13:07 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 3 Dec 2017 23:06:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-05"}

In some cases, sets of coronal events are evidently causally related,\nwhile in many other instances indirect evidence can be found. We present case\nstudies to highlight a variety of coupling processes involved in coronal\nevents. We find that physical linkages between events do occur, but concur with\nearlier studies that these couplings appear to be crucial to understanding the\ninitiation of major eruptive or explosive phenomena relatively infrequently. We\nnote that the post-eruption reconfiguration time scale of the large-scale\ncorona, estimated from the EUV afterglow, is on average longer than the mean\ntime between CMEs, so that many CMEs originate from a corona that is still\nadjusting from a previous event. We argue that the coronal field is\nintrinsically global: current systems build up over days to months, the\nrelaxation after eruptions continues over many hours, and evolving connections\neasily span much of a hemisphere. This needs to be reflected in our modeling of\nthe connections from the solar surface into the heliosphere to properly model\nthe solar wind, its perturbations, and the generation and propagation of solar\nenergetic particles. However, the large-scale field cannot be constructed\nreliably by currently available observational resources.

The distributions of optically-excited hot carriers are\ndramatically different in metal nanocrystals with large and small sizes. In\nlarge nanocrystals, most carriers have very small energies and the hot carrier\ndistribution resembles the case of a plasmon wave in bulk. In nanocrystals\nsmaller than 20nm, the carrier distribution extends to larger energies and\noccupies the whole region E_{F}<E<omega. The physical reason for the above\nbehaviors is non-conservation of momentum in a nanocrystal. Because of the\nabove properties, nanocrystals of small sizes are most suitable for designing\nof opto-electronic and photosynthetic devices based on injection of plasmonic\nelectrons and holes. The central parameter of the problem is\nDeltaN=omega/q_{L}*v_{F}, where q_{L} is the momentum transfer and v_{F} is the\nFermi velocity. In gold nanocrystals, when DeltaN<7, the high-energy\nhot-electron generation is efficient. For larger parameters DeltaN, the number\nof high-energy electrons is greatly reduced. Another important factor is the\npolarization of the exciting light. For efficient excitation of carriers with\nhigh energies, the electric-field polarization vector should be perpendicular\nto a prism-like nanoantenna (slab or platelet) with a small width ~ 10-20 nm.\nWe also show the relation between our theory for injection in plasmonic\nnanocrystals and the Fowler theory of injection from a bulk metal.

The present study provides an overview of semi-sinusoidal light\ncurves observed by the CoRoT exo-field CCDs. We selected a sample of 4,206\nlight curves presenting well-defined semi-sinusoidal signatures. The\nvariability periods were computed based on Lomb-Scargle periodograms, harmonic\nfits, and visual inspection. Color-period diagrams for the present sample show\nthe trend of an increase of the variability periods as long as the stars\nevolve. This evolutionary behavior is also noticed when comparing the period\ndistribution in the Galactic center and anti-center directions. These aspects\nindicate a compatibility with stellar rotation, although more information is\nneeded to confirm their root-causes. Considering this possibility, we\nidentified a subset of three Sun-like candidates by their photometric period.\nFinally, the variability period versus color diagram behavior was found to be\nhighly dependent on the reddening correction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 May 2013 19:42:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-06"}

In this case a simple conversion of\nlocal star formation to molecular hydrogen surface density motivated by\nobservations accounts well for the observed distribution of CO. Using radiative\ntransfer post-processing we model synthetic far-infrared spectral energy\ndistributions (SEDs) and two-dimensional emission maps for direct comparison\nwith Herschel-PACS observations. For a gas-to-dust ratio of 62:1 and the best\nmatching range of stellar feedback efficiencies the synthetic far-infrared SEDs\nof the central star forming region peak at values of ~65 - 81 Jy at 99 - 116\num, similar to a three-component modified black body fit to infrared\nobservations. Also the spatial distribution of the far-infrared emission at 70\num, 100 um, and 160 um compares well with the observations: >50% (> 35%) of the\nemission in each band is concentrated in the overlap region while only < 30% (<\n15%) is distributed to the combined emission from the two galactic nuclei in\nthe simulations (observations). As a proof of principle we show that parameter\nvariations in the feedback model result in unambiguous changes both in the\nglobal and in the spatially resolved observable far-infrared properties of\nAntennae galaxy models.

As a consequence, CMB lensing\nhighlights the DE impact in the cosmological expansion, even in the degenerate\ncase where the amplitude of the linear matter density perturbations,\nparametrised through sigma_8, is the same in both the standard cDE and LCDM\ncosmologies. For the bouncing scenario, we find that the two opposite\nbehaviours of the lens density contrast and of the matter abundance lead to a\ncounter-intuitive effect, making the power of the lensing signal lower by 10%\nthan in the LCDM scenario. Moreover, we compare the behaviour of CDM and\nbaryons in CoDECS separately, in order to isolate effects coming from the\ncoupling with the DE component.

While the\nspectrum, intensity, and angular distribution of this signal is in good\nagreement with predictions from annihilating dark matter, it has also been\nsuggested that a population of unresolved millisecond pulsars could be\nresponsible for this excess GeV emission from the Inner Galaxy. In this paper,\nwe consider this later possibility in detail. Comparing the observed spectral\nshape of the Inner Galaxy's GeV excess to the spectrum measured from 37\nmillisecond pulsars by Fermi, we find that these sources exhibit a spectral\nshape that is much too soft at sub-GeV energies to accommodate this signal. We\nalso construct population models to describe the spatial distribution and\nluminosity function of the Milky Way's millisecond pulsars. After taking into\naccount constraints from the observed distribution of Fermi sources (including\nboth sources known to be millisecond pulsars, and unidentified sources which\ncould be pulsars), we find that millisecond pulsars can account for no more\nthan ~10% of the Inner Galaxy's GeV excess.

The purpose of this\nletter is to add a new aspect to this discussion, which focuses on the\nconnection between proton superconductivity and the masses of neutron stars.\n  Assuming (as is currently the case) that the temperature evolution of Cas A\nis largely controlled by superconducting protons, we study a series of\nphenomenological proton-pairing models to determine how deep into the stellar\ncore superconducting protons actually penetrate. This allows us to establish a\nheretofore unknown relationship between the mass of the neutron star in Cas A\nand the penetration depth of the superconducting proton phase. This\nrelationship can be used to either predict the depth of the superconducting\nproton phase, or, conversely, determine the mass of Cas A from a reliable\ncalculation of the size of the proton superconducting phase in superdense\nneutron star matter. We emphasize that the strategy outlined in this paper can\nbe applied to any other neutron star of similar age, whose temperature might be\nreliably monitored over a several years period. High-mass neutron stars, such\nas the recently discovered neutron stars J1614-2230 ($1.97 \\pm 0.04\\, \\msun$)\nand J0348+0432 ($2.01 \\pm 0.04 \\, \\msun$), appear particularly appealing as a\nsignificant fraction of the protons in their cores may be superconducting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 May 2013 21:17:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 May 2013 21:44:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-30"}

This problem contains the stochastic dynamics of 2D Navier-Stokes\nequation as a special case. We consider the limit of weak forces and\ndissipation, when there is a time scale separation between the inertial time\nscale (fast) and the spin-up or spin-down time (large) needed to reach an\naverage energy balance. In this limit, we show that an adiabatic reduction (or\nstochastic averaging) of the dynamics can be performed. We then obtain a\nkinetic equation that describes the slow evolution of zonal jets over a very\nlong time scale, where the effect of non-zonal turbulence has been integrated\nout. The main theoretical difficulty, achieved in this work, is to analyze the\nstationary distribution of a Lyapunov equation that describes quasi-Gaussian\nfluctuations around each zonal jet, in the inertial limit. This is necessary to\nprove that there is no ultraviolet divergence at leading order in such a way\nthat the asymptotic expansion is self-consistent.

The EUV\njets were observed by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board the Solar\nDynamics Observatory (SDO). The Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board\nSDO measured the vector magnetic field, from which we derive the magnetic flux\nevolution, the photospheric velocity field, and the vertical electric current\nevolution. The magnetic configuration before the jets is derived by the\nnonlinear force-free field (NLFFF) extrapolation.\n  We derive that the jets are above a pair of parasitic magnetic bipoles which\nare continuously driven by photospheric diverging flows. The interaction drove\nthe build up of electric currents that we indeed observed as elongated patterns\nat the photospheric level. For the first time, the high temporal cadence of HMI\nallows to follow the evolution of such small currents. In the jet region, we\nfound that the integrated absolute current peaks repetitively in phase with the\n171 A flux evolution. The current build up and its decay are both fast, about\n10 minutes each, and the current maximum precedes the 171 A by also about 10\nminutes. Then, HMI temporal cadence is marginally fast enough to detect such\nchanges.\n  The photospheric current pattern of the jets is found associated to the\nquasi-separatrix layers deduced from the magnetic extrapolation. From previous\ntheoretical results, the observed diverging flows are expected to build\ncontinuously such currents. We conclude that magnetic reconnection occurs\nperiodically, in the current layer created between the emerging bipoles and the\nlarge scale active region field. It induced the observed recurrent coronal jets\nand the decrease of the vertical electric current magnitude.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 May 2013 09:41:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

Our focus is the dynamic behavior of the\ncirculation of velocity around boundary components and the possible exchange\nbetween flow vorticity and boundary circulation in flows with vortex sheet\ninitial data We begin by showing that the velocity can be uniquely\nreconstructed from the vorticity and boundary component circulations, which\nallows to recast 2D Euler evolution using vorticity and the circulations as\ndynamic variables. The weak form of this vortex dynamics formulation of the\nequations is called the weak vorticity formulation. The main result in this\narticle is the equivalence between the weak velocity and weak vorticity\nformulations, without sign assumptions. Next, we focus on weak solutions\nobtained by mollifying initial data and passing to the limit, with the portion\nof vorticity singular with respect to the Lebesgue measure assumed to be\nnonnegative. For these solutions we prove that the circulations around each\nboundary component cannot be smaller than the initial data circulation, so that\nnonnegative vorticity may be absorbed by the boundary, but not produced by the\nboundary. In addition, we prove that if the weak solution conserves circulation\nat the boundary components it is a boundary coupled weak solution, a stronger\nversion of the weak vorticity formulation. We prove existence of a weak\nsolution which conserves circulation at the boundary components if the initial\nvorticity is integrable.

The red particles jump at rate 1 and are in a Poisson equilibrium\nwith density $\\mu$. The green particle also jumps at rate 1, but uses different\ntransition kernels $p'$ and $p''$ depending on whether it sees a red particle\nor not. It is shown that, in the limit as $\\mu\\to\\infty$, the speed of the\ngreen particle tends to the average jump under $p'$. This result is far from\nsurprising, but it is non-trivial to prove. The proof that is given in this\nnote is based on techniques that were developed in \\cite{KeSi} to deal with\nspread-of-infection models. The main difficulty is that, due to particle\nconservation, space-time correlations in the field of red particles decay\nslowly. This places the problem in a class of random walks in dynamic random\nenvironments for which scaling laws are hard to obtain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 May 2013 14:32:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-07"}

The importance of the light EW\nsparticles in DM physics and in producing spectacular collider signals is\nemphasized. It is shown that even the preliminary data on the direct searches\nof these sparticles at the LHC, significantly constrain the parameter space of\nthe MSSM compatible with the observed relic density and provide useful hints\nabout the future search prospects. If in addition to the electroweak sparticles\nthe gluinos are also within the reach of the LHC experiments, then the gluino\nmass limits in the light slepton scenario obtained via the canonical jets +\n$\\met$ channel may be relaxed by as much as 25 $%$ compared to the existing\nlimits.

But, conclusions vary. We solve here the\ndesired set of coupled nonlinear differential equations by invoking a new set\nof dimensionless variables.

The transfer (or conversion) is\npossible only when all of the quantities distinguishable in the latter system\nare always distinguishable in the former system. By utilizing this structure,\nwe can systematically compare the representations in different unit systems.\nEspecially, the equivalence class of unit systems (EUS) plays an important role\nbecause the representations of physical quantities and equations are of the\nsame form in unit systems belonging to an EUS. The dimension of quantities is\nuniquely defined in each EUS. The EUS's form a partially ordered set.
