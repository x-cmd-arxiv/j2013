Our aim is to formulate and test a new\nmaximum likelihood approach to estimating the kinematical parameters for a\nlocal stellar sample when only the transverse velocities are known (from\nparallaxes and proper motions). Methods. Numerical simulations using\nsynthetically generated data as well as real data (based on the\nGeneva-Copenhagen survey) are used to investigate the statistical properties\n(bias, precision) of the method, and to compare its performance with the much\nsimpler \"projection method\" described by Dehnen & Binney (1998). Results. The\nmaximum likelihood method gives more correct estimates of the dispersion when\nobservational errors are important, and guarantees a positive-definite\ndispersion matrix, which is not always obtained with the projection method.\nPossible extensions and improvements of the method are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Feb 2013 20:26:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-19"}

It quickly becomes impossible to test, for all pairs\nof compounds in a rapidly growing network, whether they can react with each\nother. More sophisticated and efficient strategies are therefore required to\nconstruct very large chemical reaction networks.\n  Undirected labeled graphs and graph rewriting are natural models of chemical\ncompounds and chemical reactions. Borrowing the idea of partial evaluation from\nfunctional programming, we introduce partial applications of rewrite rules.\nBinding substrate to rules increases the number of rules but drastically prunes\nthe substrate sets to which it might match, resulting in dramatically reduced\nresource requirements. At the same time, exploration strategies can be guided,\ne.g. based on restrictions on the product molecules to avoid the explicit\nenumeration of very unlikely compounds. To this end we introduce here a generic\nframework for the specification of exploration strategies in graph-rewriting\nsystems. Using key examples of complex chemical networks from sugar chemistry\nand the realm of metabolic networks we demonstrate the feasibility of a\nhigh-level strategy framework.\n  The ideas presented here can not only be used for a strategy-based chemical\nspace exploration that has close correspondence of experimental results, but\nare much more general.

Although there is no\nconserved current composed of the perturbation field corresponding to the\nCarter constant, it has been shown that the averaged rate of change of the\nCarter constant can be given by a simple formula, when there exists a\nsimultaneous turning point of the radial and polar oscillations. However, an\ninspiralling orbit may cross a \"resonance\" point, where the frequencies of the\nradial and polar orbital oscillations are in a rational ratio. At the resonance\npoint, one cannot find a simultaneous turning point in general.

Mapping Academic Institutions According\n  to Their Journal Publication Profile: Spanish Universities as a Case Study.\n  Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology,\n  63(11): 2328-2340","doi":"10.1002/asi.22735","report-no":null,"categories":"cs.DL","license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","abstract":"  We introduce a novel methodology for mapping academic institutions based on\ntheir journal publication profiles. We believe that journals in which\nresearchers from academic institutions publish their works can be considered as\nuseful identifiers for representing the relationships between these\ninstitutions and establishing comparisons. However, when academic journals are\nused for research output representation, distinctions must be introduced\nbetween them, based on their value as institution descriptors. This leads us to\nthe use of journal weights attached to the institution identifiers. Since a\njournal in which researchers from a large proportion of institutions published\ntheir papers may be a bad indicator of similarity between two academic\ninstitutions, it seems reasonable to weight it in accordance with how\nfrequently researchers from different institutions published their papers in\nthis journal. Cluster analysis can then be applied to group the academic\ninstitutions, and dendrograms can be provided to illustrate groups of\ninstitutions following agglomerative hierarchical clustering. In order to test\nthis methodology, we use a sample of Spanish universities as a case study. We\nfirst map the study sample according to an institution's overall research\noutput, then we use it for two scientific fields (Information and Communication\nTechnologies, as well as Medicine and Pharmacology) as a means to demonstrate\nhow our methodology can be applied, not only for analyzing institutions as a\nwhole, but also in different disciplinary contexts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Feb 2013 10:37:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-19"}

The reasons of the revealed particularity are explained by means of\nthe modified system approach [A.E. Hramov, A.A. Koronovskii, Phys. Rev.
