However, it is not yet clear whether\ndephasing can enhance transport in an interacting many-body system. Here, we\naddress this question by analyzing the transport properties of a boundary\ndriven spinless fermion chain with nearest-neighbor interactions subject to\nbulk dephasing. The many-body nonequilibrium stationary state is determined\nusing large-scale matrix product simulations of the corresponding quantum\nmaster equation. We find dephasing enhanced transport only in the strongly\ninteracting regime, where it is shown to induce incoherent transitions bridging\nthe gap between bound dark states and bands of mobile eigenstates. The generic\nnature of the transport enhancement is illustrated by a simple toy model, which\ncontains the basic elements required for its emergence. Surprisingly, the\neffect is significant even in the linear response regime of the full system,\nand it is predicted to exist for any large and finite chain. The response of\nthe system to dephasing also establishes a signature of an underlying\nnonequilibrium phase transition between regimes of transport degradation and\nenhancement. The existence of this transition is shown not to depend on the\nintegrability of the model considered. As a result, dephasing enhanced\ntransport is expected to persist in more realistic nonequilibrium strongly\ncorrelated systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Feb 2013 16:14:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 Apr 2015 20:18:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-27"}

On the other\nhand, if G_{ev} is reductive, then it is easy to see that G_u is finite (odd)\nsupergroup. In other words, the reductivity of an algebraic supergroup does not\ncorrespond to the reductivity of its largest even subgroup in contrast to such\nproperties as unipotency or solvability. In the last section of our article we\ndescribe reductive algebraic supergroups in terms of sandwich pairs and give\nnecessary and sufficient conditions for an algebraic supergroup to be\nquasireductive. The last result complements the recent Serganova's description\nof quasireductive supergroups in terms of structural properties of their Lie\nsuperalgebras. Our approach is focused on the normal subgroup structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Feb 2013 17:07:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-25"}

We intend to\nobtain more accurate parameters for NGC 7419, using techniques different from\nthose of previous authors, so that it may be used as a calibrator for more\nobscured clusters. We obtained Str\\\"omgren photometry of the open cluster NGC\n7419, as well as classification spectroscopy of ~20 stars in the area. We then\napplied standard analysis and classification techniques. We find a distance of\n4+-0.4 kpc and an age of 14+-2 Myr for NGC 7419. The main-sequence turn-off is\nfound at spectral type B1, in excellent agreement. We identify 179 B-type\nmembers, implying that there are more than 1200 $M_{\\sun}$ in B stars at\npresent. Extrapolating this to lower masses indicates an initial cluster mass\nof between 7000 and 10000 Msolar, depending on the shape of the Initial Mass\nFunction. We find a very high fraction (~40%) of Be stars around the turn-off,\nbut very few Be stars at lower masses. We also report for the first time a\nstrong variability in the emission characteristics of Be stars. We verified\nthat the parameters of the red supergiant members can be used to obtain\naccurate cluster parameters. NGC 7419 is sufficiently massive to serve as a\ntestbed for theoretical predictions and as a template to compare more obscured\nclusters. The distribution of stars above the main-sequence turn-off is\ndifficult to accommodate with current evolutionary tracks. Though the presence\nof five red supergiants is marginally consistent with theoretical expectations,\nthe high number of Be stars and very low number of luminous evolved B stars\nhint at some unknown physical factor that is not considered in current\nsynthesis models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Feb 2013 17:13:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

The CSIT is\ngiven by an arbitrary deterministic function of the channel state. This\ncharacteristic yields a full control over how much state information is\navailable, from perfect to no information. In literature, capacity derivations\nfor wireless ergodic fading channels, specifically for fading BCs, mostly rely\non the analysis of channels comprising of parallel sub-channels. This technique\nis usually suitable for the cases where perfect state information is available\nat the transmitters. In this paper, new arguments are proposed to directly\nderive (without resorting to the analysis of parallel channels) capacity bounds\nfor the two-user fading BC with both common and private messages based on the\nexisting bounds for the discrete channel. Specifically, a novel approach is\ndeveloped to adapt and evaluate the well-known UV-outer bound for the Gaussian\nfading channel using the entropy power inequality. Our approach indeed sheds\nlight on the role of broadcast auxiliaries in the fading channel. It is shown\nthat the derived outer bound is optimal for the channel with perfect CSIT as\nwell as for some special cases with partial CSIT. Our outer bound is also\ndirectly applicable to the case without CSIT which has been recently considered\nin several papers. Next, the approach is developed to analyze for the fading BC\nwith secrecy. In the case of perfect CSIT, a full characterization of the\nsecrecy capacity region is derived for the channel with common and confidential\nmessages. This result completes a gap in a previous work by Ekrem and Ulukus.\nFor the channel without common message, the secrecy capacity region is also\nderived when the transmitter has access only to the degradedness ordering of\nthe channel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Feb 2013 20:49:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-25"}

In this paper, we present the first\nmultidimensional simulations of the post-merger evolution of white dwarf\nbinaries to include the effect of the magnetic field. In these systems, the two\nwhite dwarfs complete a final merger on a dynamical timescale, and are tidally\ndisrupted, producing a rapidly-rotating white dwarf merger surrounded by a hot\ncorona and a thick, differentially-rotating disk. The disk is strongly\nsusceptible to the magnetorotational instability (MRI), and we demonstrate that\nthis leads to the rapid growth of an initially dynamically weak magnetic field\nin the disk, the spin-down of the white dwarf merger, and to the subsequent\ncentral ignition of the white dwarf merger. Additionally, these magnetized\nmodels exhibit new features not present in prior hydrodynamic studies of white\ndwarf mergers, including the development of MRI turbulence in the hot disk,\nmagnetized outflows carrying a significant fraction of the disk mass, and the\nmagnetization of the white dwarf merger to field strengths $\\sim 2 \\times 10^8$\nG.

This stringent\nlimit at a look back time of roughly half the age of the universe has profound\nimplications for rolling scalar field cosmologies and the new physics that they\nrequire. Many of these cosmologies invoke a scalar field phi that is also\ncoupled to the electromagnetic field causing the values of the fundamental\nconstants, mu and the fine structure constant alpha to roll with time.

We expect the jet's acceleration to produce a GW\nMemory signal. While all relativistic jet models display anti-beaming of GW\nradiation away from the jet axis, thus radiating away from directions of GRBs'\ngamma radiation, this effect is not overwhelming. The decrease of the signal\namplitude towards the cone of gamma-ray detectability is weak, and for some\nmodels and parameters the GW signal reaches a significant amplitude for much of\nthe gamma-ray cone. Thus both signals may be jointly detected. We find\ndifferent waveforms and fourier signatures for uniform jets and structured jet\nmodels - thus offering a method of using GW signatures to probe the internal\nstructure and acceleration of GRB jets. The GW signal peaks just outside the\njet (core) of a uniform (structuted) jet. Within the jet (core) the GW signal\ndisplays wiggles, due to a polarization effect; thus for a uniform jet, the\npeak amplitude accompanies a smoother signal than the peak of a structured jet.\nFor the most probable detection angle and for typical GRB parameters, we expect\nfrequencies < ~600Hz and amplitudes h~10^-25.

The ability to\ndifferentiate between random positions and special points in space around which\nhalos or voids may form (peaks/dips), encoded in the new formula and reflected\nin the algorithm, naturally leads to a straightforward implementation of an\nexcursion set model for peaks and dips in Gaussian random fields - one of the\nkey advantages of this sampling procedure.

Conducting an experiment\nwith subject $i$ reveals an unknown value $y_i\\in R$ to E. E typically assumes\nsome hypothetical relationship between $x_i$'s and $y_i$'s, e.g., $y_i \\approx\n\\beta x_i$, and estimates $\\beta$ from experiments, e.g., through linear\nregression. As a proxy for various practical constraints, E may select only a\nsubset of subjects on which to conduct the experiment.\n  We initiate the study of budgeted mechanisms for experimental design. In this\nsetting, E has a budget $B$. Each subject $i$ declares an associated cost $c_i\n>0$ to be part of the experiment, and must be paid at least her cost. In\nparticular, the Experimental Design Problem (EDP) is to find a set $S$ of\nsubjects for the experiment that maximizes $V(S) = \\log\\det(I_d+\\sum_{i\\in\nS}x_i\\T{x_i})$ under the constraint $\\sum_{i\\in S}c_i\\leq B$; our objective\nfunction corresponds to the information gain in parameter $\\beta$ that is\nlearned through linear regression methods, and is related to the so-called\n$D$-optimality criterion. Further, the subjects are strategic and may lie about\ntheir costs.\n  We present a deterministic, polynomial time, budget feasible mechanism\nscheme, that is approximately truthful and yields a constant factor\napproximation to EDP. In particular, for any small $\\delta > 0$ and $\\epsilon >\n0$, we can construct a (12.98, $\\epsilon$)-approximate mechanism that is\n$\\delta$-truthful and runs in polynomial time in both $n$ and\n$\\log\\log\\frac{B}{\\epsilon\\delta}$. We also establish that no truthful,\nbudget-feasible algorithms is possible within a factor 2 approximation, and\nshow how to generalize our approach to a wide class of learning problems,\nbeyond linear regression.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Feb 2013 22:12:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 Feb 2013 09:07:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 9 Jul 2013 14:59:15 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 11 Jul 2013 15:51:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-06"}

We ask: if\nthe spectral gap is only inverse polynomially small, will equilibration methods\nbased on slowly changing the Hamiltonian parameters in the QMC simulation\nsucceed in a polynomial time? We show that this is not true, by constructing\ncounter-examples. Some examples are Hamiltonians where the space of\nconfigurations where the wavefunction has non-negligible amplitude has a\nnontrivial fundamental group, causing the space of trajectories in imaginary\ntime to break into disconnected components, with only negligible probability\noutside these components.

More severe effects leading to failure to solve the optimization can\noccur when the fundamental group is a free group on two generators. Other\nexamples where QMC fails have a trivial fundamental group, but still use ideas\nfrom topology relating group presentations to simplicial complexes.

Using experimental data to\ninvestigate the underlying physics is also essential, particularly when\nsimulations and experiments are not consistent with each other. This is a\ndifficult task, due to the large number of physical models that play a role,\nand due to the complex (and as a result, noisy) nature of the experiments. This\nresults in a large number of parameters that make any inference a daunting\ntask; it is also very important to consistently treat both experimental and\nprior understanding of the problem. In this paper we present a Bayesian method\nthat includes both these effects, and allows the inference of a set of\nmodifiers which have been constructed to give information about microphysics\nmodels from experimental data. We pay particular attention to radiation\ntransport models. The inference takes into account a large set of experimental\nparameters and an estimate of the prior knowledge through a modified $\\chi^{2}$\nfunction, which is minimised using an efficient genetic algorithm. Both factors\nplay an essential role in our analysis. We find that although there is evidence\nof inaccuracies in off-line calculations of X ray drive intensity and Ge $L$\nshell absorption, modifications to radiation transport are unable to reconcile\ndifferences between 1D HYDRA simulations and the experiment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Feb 2013 00:20:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-04"}

For an interesting result, it is found that the number of\nzero-mode fermions is related to $N$ of the $Z_N$ symmetry. In other words, the\ngeneration of matter relates to the type of orbifolds.

The main contribution comes from z<2, where dark energy\nleads to a decay of potentials. As the same photons are gravitationally lensed\nby these decaying potentials, there exists a high degree of correlation between\nthe ISW effect and CMB lensing, leading to a non-zero three-point correlation\n(bispectrum) of the observed temperature anisotropy. This ISW-lensing\nbispectrum, whose shape resembles that of the so-called \"local-form\" primordial\nbispectrum parametrized by fNL, is known to be the largest contamination of\nfNL. In order to avoid a spurious detection of primordial non-Gaussianity, we\nneed to remove the ISW-lensing bias. In this work, we investigate three\ndebiasing methods: (I) subtraction of an expected, ensemble average of the\nISW-lensing bispectrum; (II) subtraction of a measured ISW-lensing bispectrum;\nand (III) direct subtraction of an estimated ISW signal from an observed\ntemperature map. One may use an estimation of the ISW map from external non-CMB\ndata or that from the CMB data themselves. As the methods II and III are based\non fewer assumptions about the nature of dark energy, they are preferred over\nthe method I. While the methods I and II yield unbiased estimates of fNL with\ncomparable error bars, the method III yields a biased result when the\nunderlying primordial fNL is non-zero and the ISW map is estimated from a\nlensing potential reconstructed from the observed temperature map. One of the\nsources of the bias is a lensing reconstruction noise bias which is independent\nof fNL and can be calculated precisely, but other fNL-dependent terms are\ndifficult to compute reliably. We thus conclude that the method II is the best,\nmodel-independent way to remove the ISW-lensing bias of fNL, enabling us to\ntest the physics of inflation with smaller systematic errors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Feb 2013 13:48:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 Mar 2013 17:34:44 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 9 Apr 2013 11:50:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-10"}

Aims. We obtained NACO astrometric observations\nwith two goals: (1) to confirm the orientation of the orbital plane of the\neclipsing pair on the sky determined by interferometry (Paper III) and (2)\ndemonstrate the capabilities of narrow-angle adaptive optics astrometry on a\nsimple system with predictable astrometric properties. Methods. We measured the\nangular separation vector between the eclipsing binary delta Vel A and the\nvisual companion delta Vel B from narrow-band images at 2.17 microns obtained\nwith the VLT/NACO adaptive optics system. Based on these observations and our\nprevious determination of the orbital parameters of the wide binary delta Vel\nA-B, we derive the apparent displacement of the center-of-light of the\neclipsing pair at 11 epochs over its orbital cycle. Results. We detect the\nastrometric wobble of the center of light of the delta Vel A pair relatively to\nB with a typical measurement precision of ~50 microarcseconds per epoch, for a\ntotal amplitude of the measured displacement of ~2 milliarcseconds.\nConclusions. The detected wobble is in agreement with our model presented in\nPaper III and confirms the orientation of the Aab orbital plane on the sky. The\nresidual dispersion compared to our model is 110 microarcseconds rms, that we\ntentatively attribute to photometric variability of the fast rotating A-type\ncomponents Aa and/or Ab in the BrGamma line. Based on these results, we\nconclude that in favorable conditions (bright source with only two resolved\ncomponents, small angular separation), narrow-angle astrometry with adaptive\noptics on an 8-meter class telescope can reach an accuracy of 50 to 100\nmicroarcseconds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Feb 2013 15:25:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

As in\nthe time scales literature, we first derive discrete analogues of all the\ncommon continuous calculus functions with an eye to maintaining as much\nsimilarity as possible between these discrete analogues and their continuous\nforebears. For example, in order to maintain the crucial property that the\nderivative of an exponential is a constant times itself, we replace the\ncontinuous exponential, $e^{ax}$, with a discrete function, $e_{\\Delta x}(a,x)\n= [1+a \\Delta x]^{x / \\Delta x}$. Next, we develop a unified method of\nevaluating integrals of discrete variables. We discover that summations such as\nthe Riemann Zeta Function, the Hurwitz Zeta Function, and the Digamma Function\nfrequently appear in evaluating such integrals. Thus, we subsume these\nfunctions into a generalization of the natural logarithm, which we name\n\"$lnd(n,\\Delta x,x)$\", and evaluate many types of discrete variable integrals\nin terms of it.

Several measures are in use\ndiffering on specific tables and in their dependence on the margins.\n  We study a 2-dimensional group of margin transformations on the 3-dimensional\nmanifold T of all 2x2 probability tables. The margin transformations allow\nintroducing natural coordinates that identify T with the real 3-space such that\nthe x-axis corresponds to log(sqrt(odds-ratio)) and margins vary on planes\nx=const. We use these coordinates to visualise and compare measures of\nassociation with respect to their dependence on the margins given the\nodds-ratio, their limit behaviour when cells approach zero and their weighting\nproperties.\n  We propose a novel measure of association in which tables with single small\nentries are up-weighted but those with skewed margins are down-weighted\naccording to the relative entropy among the tables of the same odds-ratio.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Feb 2013 19:05:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-26"}

It has been established that the\nelectromotive force (emf) value should be dependent not only on changes of the\nmagnetic induction flux through a turn and on symmetry of its crossing by\nmagnetic power lines also. The law of EMI is applicable in sufficient\napproximation in case of the changes of the magnetic field near the turn are\nsymmetrical. Experimental study of the induced emf in arcs and a direct section\nof the conductor placed into the variable field has been carried out. Linear\ndependence of the induced emf on the length of the arc has been ascertained in\ncase of the magnetic field distribution symmetry about it. Influence of the\nmagnetic field symmetry on the induced emf in the arc has been observed. The\ncurve of the induced emf in the direct section over period of current pulse is\nsimilar to this one for the turns and arcs. The general law of EMI for a\ncurvilinear conductor has been deduced. Calculation of the induced emf in the\nturns wrapped over it and comparison with the experimental data has been made.\nThe proportionality factor has been ascertained for the law. Special conditions\nhave been described, when the induced emf may not exist in the presence of\ninductive current. Theoretical estimation of the inductive current has been\nmade at a induced low voltage in the turn. It has been noted the necessity to\ntake into account the concentration of current carriers in calculation of the\ninduced emf in semiconductors and ionized conductors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Feb 2013 17:16:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-05"}
