Different from prior works that mainly considered the saturated\nnetwork, we take into account in our analysis the impacts of empty transmit\nbuffers on the interactions and dependencies among links in the network that is\nmore common in practice. It is known that the empty transmit buffer incurs\nextra waiting time for a link to compete for the channel airtime usage, since\nwhen it has no packet waiting for transmission, the link will not perform\nchannel competition. The basic idea behind EAI is that this extra waiting time\ncan be mapped to an equivalent \"longer\" backoff countdown time for the\nunsaturated link, yielding a lower link access intensity that is defined as the\nmean packet transmission time divided by the mean backoff countdown time. That\nis, we can compute the \"equivalent access intensity\" of an unsaturated link to\nincorporate the effects of the empty transmit buffer on its behavior of channel\ncompetition. Then, prior saturated ideal CSMA network (ICN) model can be\nadopted for link throughput computation. Specifically, we propose an iterative\nalgorithm, \"Compute-and-Compare\", to identify which links are unsaturated under\ncurrent offered-load and protocol settings, compute their \"equivalent access\nintensities\" and calculate link throughputs. Simulation shows that our\nalgorithm has high accuracy under various offered-load and protocol settings.\nWe believe the ability to identify unsaturated links and compute links\nthroughputs as established in this paper will serve an important first step\ntoward the design and optimization of general CSMA wireless networks with\noffered-load control.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Feb 2013 16:05:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-20"}

The\nfluctuation-dissipation theorem therefore no longer holds. The stationary state\nis however still Gibbsian, i.e., the weights of configurations are given by the\nBoltzmann factor corresponding to the ferromagnetic Hamiltonian. The model is\nexactly solvable in any dimension, enabling an analytical evaluation of\ntime-dependent observables. We show the existence of two regimes of violation\nof the fluctuation-dissipation theorem in the nonequilibrium stationary state:\na regime of weak violation where the stationary fluctuation-dissipation ratio\nis finite but less than unity and varies continuously with the asymmetry, and a\nregime of strong violation where the fluctuation-dissipation ratio vanishes\nasymptotically. This phenomenon was first uncovered in the asymmetric kinetic\nIsing chain.

Energy spectra and time series were extracted\nfrom two XMM-Newton observations to search for pulsations, characterise the\nspectrum, and measure spectral and timing changes. Long-term X-ray variability\nwas studied using archival ROSAT data. The XMM positions were used to identify\nthe optical counterpart. We obtained UV to NIR photometry to characterise the\ncompanion, along with its 4000 d long I-band light curve. We observed LXP169\nwith Swift at two predicted eclipse times.

By\nstudying these violations, useful insights come to light: we make the case that\nlocally metric algorithms should leverage outside information to solve the\ngeneral recognition problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Feb 2013 17:02:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-20"}

The fractional polarization in the two bright radio\nand X-ray lobes of the SNR is measured to be 0.17, while in the southeastern\nsector, where the radio and non-thermal X-ray emission are much weaker, the\npolarization fraction reaches a value of 0.6 +- 0.2, close to the theoretical\nlimit of 0.7. We interpret this result as evidence of a disordered, turbulent\nmagnetic field in the lobes, where particle acceleration is believed to be\nefficient, and a highly ordered field in the southeast, where the acceleration\nefficiency has been shown to be very low. Utilizing the frequency coverage of\nour observations, an average rotation measure of ~12 rad/m2 is determined from\nthe combined data set, which is then used to obtain the intrinsic direction of\nthe magnetic field vectors. While the orientation of magnetic field vectors\nacross the SNR shell appear radial, a large fraction of the magnetic vectors\nlie parallel to the Galactic Plane. Along the highly polarized southeastern\nrim, the field is aligned tangent to the shock, and therefore also nearly\nparallel to the Galactic Plane. These results strongly suggest that the ambient\nfield surrounding SN 1006 is aligned with this direction (i.e., from northeast\nto southwest) and that the bright lobes are due to a polar cap geometry. Our\nstudy establishes that the most efficient particle acceleration and generation\nof magnetic turbulence in SN 1006 is attained for shocks in which the magnetic\nfield direction and shock normal are quasi-parallel, while inefficient\nacceleration and little to no generation of magnetic turbulence obtains for the\nquasi-perpendicular case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Feb 2013 17:10:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

In situ\nimaging of transcripts and proteins is the gold-standard, but it is difficult\nand time consuming to apply to an entire genome, even when highly automated.\nSequencing, in contrast, is fast and genome-wide, but is generally applied to\nhomogenized tissues, thereby discarding spatial information. It is likely that\nthese methods will ultimately converge, and we will be able to sequence RNAs in\nsitu, simultaneously determining their identity and location. As a step along\nthis path, we developed methods to cryosection individual blastoderm stage\nDrosophila melanogaster embryos along the anterior-posterior axis and sequence\nthe mRNA isolated from each 25 micron slice. The spatial patterns of gene\nexpression we infer closely match patterns previously determined by in situ\nhybridization and microscopy. We applied this method to generate a genome-wide\ntimecourse of spatial gene expression from shortly after fertilization through\ngastrulation.

We first consider a deterministic offline system setting.

The sources are radio bright, have no identifications\nor optical source coincidences, are more than 5% linearly polarized, and are\nspatially unresolved in the catalog. If these sources are fast-spinning pulsars\n(e.g. sub-millisecond pulsars), previous large-scale pulsar surveys may have\nmissed detection due to instrumental and computational limitations, eclipsing\neffects, or diffractive scintillation. The discovery of a sub-millisecond\npulsar would significantly constrain the neutron star equation of state and\nwould have implications for models predicting a rapid slowdown of highly\nrecycled X-ray pulsars to millisecond periods from, e.g., accretion disk\ndecoupling. These same sources were previously searched unsuccessfully for\npulsations at 610 MHz with the Lovell Telescope at Jodrell Bank.

These\nresults are based on high-resolution, near-infrared spectroscopy taken with the\nKeck II telescope to provide a first characterization of these systems as\ndouble-lined rather than single-lined. It applies the power of infrared\nspectroscopy to the detection of cool secondaries; the flux scales as a less\nsteep function of mass in the infrared than in the visible, thus enabling an\nidentification of low-mass secondaries. We found that the RX J0513.1+0851 and\nRX J0539.9+0956 primary stars are fast rotators, 60 km/s and 80 km/s\nrespectively; this introduces extra difficulty in the detection of the\nsecondary component as a result of the quite broad absorption lines.

In fermionic systems, topological defects may provide bound states\nfor fermions that often play a crucial role for the system's transport\nproperties. Famous examples are Andreev bound states inside vortex cores,\nfractionally charged solitons in relativistic quantum field theory, and the\nspinless charged solitons responsible for the high conductivity of polymers.\nHowever, the free motion of topological defects in electronic systems is\nhindered by pinning at impurities. Here we create long-lived solitons in a\nstrongly interacting fermionic superfluid by imprinting a phase step into the\nsuperfluid wavefunction, and directly observe their oscillatory motion in the\ntrapped superfluid. As the interactions are tuned from the regime of\nBose-Einstein condensation (BEC) of tightly bound molecules towards the\nBardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) limit of long-range Cooper pairs, the effective\nmass of the solitons increases dramatically to more than 200 times their bare\nmass.

Due to the existence of the unknown inherent nonlinear dynamics, the\nstability analysis and the finite-time convergence analysis of the closed-loop\nsystem under the proposed consensus algorithm are more challenging than those\nunder the well-studied consensus algorithms for known linear systems. For this\npurpose, we propose a novel stability tool based on a generalized comparison\nlemma. With the aid of the novel stability tool, it is shown that the proposed\nnonlinear consensus algorithm can guarantee finite-time convergence if the\ndirected switching interaction graph has a directed spanning tree at each time\ninterval. Specifically, the finite-time convergence is shown by comparing the\nclosed-loop system under the proposed consensus algorithm with some\nwell-designed closed-loop system whose stability properties are easier to\nobtain. Moreover, the stability and the finite-time convergence of the\nclosed-loop system using the proposed consensus algorithm under a (general)\ndirected switching interaction graph can even be guaranteed by the stability\nand the finite-time convergence of some special well-designed nonlinear\nclosed-loop system under some special directed switching interaction graph,\nwhere each agent has at most one neighbor whose state is either the maximum of\nthose states that are smaller than its own state or the minimum of those states\nthat are larger than its own state.

Neutralino dark matter in\nnon-minimal supersymmetric models, such as the NMSSM, is an especially\nwell-motivated theoretical setup which can explain the line. We explore the\npossibility that regions of the NMSSM consistent with the 130 GeV line can also\nproduce the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe via electroweak\nbaryogenesis. We find that such regions can in fact accommodate a strongly\nfirst-order electroweak phase transition (due to the singlet contribution to\nthe effective potential), while also avoiding a light stop and producing a\nStandard Model-like Higgs in the observed mass range. Simultaneously,\nCP-violation from a complex phase in the wino-higgsino sector can account for\nthe observed baryon asymmetry through resonant sources at the electroweak phase\ntransition, while satisfying current constraints from dark matter, collider,\nand electric dipole moment (EDM) experiments. This result is possible by virtue\nof a relatively light pseudoscalar Higgs sector with a small degree of mixing,\nwhich yields efficient s-channel resonant neutralino annihilation consistent\nwith indirect detection constraints, and of the moderate values of $\\mu$\nrequired to obtain a bino-like LSP consistent with the line. The wino mass is\nessentially a free parameter which one can tune to satisfy electroweak\nbaryogenesis. Thus, the NMSSM framework can potentially explain the origins of\nboth baryonic and dark matter components in the Universe. The tightness of the\nconstraints we impose on this scenario makes it extraordinarily predictive, and\nconclusively testable in the near future by modest improvements in EDM and dark\nmatter search experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Feb 2013 00:53:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-24"}

We target our efforts on a\nlong term evolution advanced (LTE-A) orthogonal frequency division multiple\naccess (OFDMA) macro-cell sharing the spectrum with a randomly deployed second\ntier of small-cells. In such networks, high levels of co-channel interference\nbetween the macro and small base stations (MBS/SBS) may largely limit the\npotential spectral efficiency gains provided by the frequency reuse 1. To\naddress this issue, we propose a novel cognitive interference alignment based\nscheme to protect the macro-cell from the cross-tier interference, while\nmitigating the co-tier interference in the second tier.

Motivated by this and building upon the\nclassic cognitive radio (CR) network model, this paper proposes a novel method\nfor wireless networks coexisting where low-power mobiles in a secondary\nnetwork, called secondary transmitters (STs), harvest ambient RF energy from\ntransmissions by nearby active transmitters in a primary network, called\nprimary transmitters (PTs), while opportunistically accessing the spectrum\nlicensed to the primary network. We consider a stochastic-geometry model in\nwhich PTs and STs are distributed as independent homogeneous Poisson point\nprocesses (HPPPs) and communicate with their intended receivers at fixed\ndistances. Each PT is associated with a guard zone to protect its intended\nreceiver from ST's interference, and at the same time delivers RF energy to STs\nlocated in its harvesting zone. Based on the proposed model, we analyze the\ntransmission probability of STs and the resulting spatial throughput of the\nsecondary network. The optimal transmission power and density of STs are\nderived for maximizing the secondary network throughput under the given\noutage-probability constraints in the two coexisting networks, which reveal key\ninsights to the optimal network design. Finally, we show that our analytical\nresult can be generally applied to a non-CR setup, where distributed wireless\npower chargers are deployed to power coexisting wireless transmitters in a\nsensor network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Feb 2013 02:26:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 Jul 2013 05:41:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-15"}

We consider both the cases of optical and\nspin coherences, rephased by optical or radio-frequency (rf) ARPs,\nrespectively. We show how a rephasing sequence consisting of two ARPs in a\ndouble-echo scheme is equivalent to the identity operator (any state can be\nrecovered), as long as certain conditions are fulfilled. Our mathematical\ntreatment of the ARPs leads to a very simple geometrical interpretation within\nthe Bloch sphere that permits a visual comprehension of the rephasing process.\nWe also identify the conditions that ensure the rephasing, finding that the\nphase of the optical or rf ARP fields plays a key role in the capability of the\nsequence to preserve the phase of the superposition state. This settles a\ndifference between optical and rf ARPs, since field phase control is not\nreadily guaranteed in the former case.

The algorithm described in this paper solves the\nmaximum likelihood problem iteratively and encoding a positivity constraint\ninto the iterative optimization scheme. The result is therefore a classical\nExpectation Maximization method this time applied not to an image deconvolution\nproblem but to image reconstruction from count modulation profiles.

The method is applied to both reproduce synthetic\nflaring configurations and reconstruct images from experimental data\ncorresponding to three real events.

MEOP is usually performed at low magnetic field (~ 1\nmT) and low pressure (~ 1 mbar), which results in a low magnetization\nproduction rate. A delicate polarization-preserving step of compression is also\nrequired. It was demonstrated in sealed cells that high nuclear polarization\nvalues can be obtained at higher pressures with MEOP, if performed at high\nmagnetic field (non-standard conditions). In this work the feasibility of\nbuilding a high-field polarizer that operates within a commercial 1.5 T scanner\nwas evaluated. Preliminary measurements of nuclear polarization with sealed\ncells filled at different 3He gas pressures (1.33 to 267 mbar) were performed.\nThe use of an annular shape for the laser beam increased by 25 % the achievable\nnuclear polarization equilibrium value (Meq) at 32 and 67 mbar as compared to a\nGaussian beam shape. Meq values of 66.4 and 31 % were obtained at 32 and 267\nmbar respectively and the magnetization production rate was increased by a\nfactor of 10 compared to the best results obtained under standard conditions.\nTo study the reproducibility of the method in a polarizing system, the same\nexperiments were performed with small cells connected to a gas handling system.\nThe polarization build-up times were approximately 3 times longer in the 20-30\nmbar range of pressure than those obtained for the 32 mbar sealed cell.\nHowever, reasonable Meq values of 40-60 % were achieved in a 90 mL open cell.\nBased on these findings, a novel compact polarizing system was designed and\nbuilt. Its typical output is a 3He gas flow rate of 15 sccm with a polarization\nof 33 %. In-vivo lung MRI ventilation images were acquired to demonstrate the\npolarizer s application.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Feb 2013 10:26:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

Cross-domain\ncollaborative filtering (CDCF) has been studied as an effective mechanism to\nalleviate data sparseness of one domain using the knowledge about user\npreferences from other domains. A key question to be answered in the context of\nCDCF is what common characteristics can be deployed to link different domains\nfor effective knowledge transfer. In this paper, we assess the usefulness of\nuser-contributed (social) tags in this respect. We do so by means of the\nGeneralized Tag-induced Cross-domain Collaborative Filtering (GTagCDCF)\napproach that we propose in this paper and that we developed based on the\ngeneral collective matrix factorization framework. Assessment is done by a\nseries of experiments, using publicly available CF datasets that represent\nthree cross-domain cases, i.e., two two-domain cases and one three-domain case.\nA comparative analysis on two-domain cases involving GTagCDCF and several\nstate-of-the-art CDCF approaches indicates the increased benefit of using\nsocial tags as representatives of explicit links between domains for CDCF as\ncompared to the implicit links deployed by the existing CDCF methods. In\naddition, we show that users from different domains can already benefit from\nGTagCDCF if they only share a few common tags. Finally, we use the three-domain\ncase to validate the robustness of GTagCDCF with respect to the scale of\ndatasets and the varying number of domains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Feb 2013 12:37:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 Dec 2013 16:03:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-25"}

The unique angle of this work is the rigorous analysis of survey\nselection effects, making this the first study of the star-formation-dominated,\nIR-luminous population within a framework almost entirely free of selection\nbiases. We find that IR-luminous galaxies have SEDs with broad far-IR peaks\ncharacterised by cool/extended dust emission and average dust temperatures in\nthe 25-45K range. Hot (T>45K) SEDs and cold (T<25K), cirrus-dominated SEDs are\nrare, with most sources being within the range occupied by warm starbursts such\nas M82 and cool spirals such as M51. We observe a luminosity-temperature (L-T)\nrelation, where the average dust temperature of log[L_IR/L_sun]=12.5 galaxies\nis about 10K higher than that of their log[L_IR/L_sun]=10.5 counterparts.\nHowever, although the increased dust heating in more luminous systems is the\ndriving factor behind the L-T relation, the increase in dust mass and/or\nstarburst size with luminosity plays a dominant role in shaping it. Our results\nshow that the dust conditions in IR-luminous sources evolve with cosmic time:\nat high redshift, dust temperatures are on average up to 10K lower than what is\nmeasured locally. This is manifested as a flattening of the L-T relation,\nsuggesting that (U)LIRGs in the early Universe are typically characterised by a\nmore extended dust distribution and/or higher dust masses than local equivalent\nsources. Interestingly, the evolution in dust temperature is luminosity\ndependent, with the fraction of LIRGs with T<35K showing a 2-fold increase from\nz~0 to z~2, whereas that of ULIRGs with T<35K shows a 6-fold increase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Feb 2013 13:05:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

The purpose of this paper is to\nreview and discuss some of the new important developments in small area\nestimation methods. Rao [Small Area Estimation (2003)] wrote a very\ncomprehensive book, which covers all the main developments in this topic until\nthat time. A few review papers have been written after 2003, but they are\nlimited in scope. Hence, the focus of this review is on new developments in the\nlast 7-8 years, but to make the review more self-contained, I also mention\nshortly some of the older developments. The review covers both design-based and\nmodel-dependent methods, with the latter methods further classified into\nfrequentist and Bayesian methods. The style of the paper is similar to the\nstyle of my previous review on SAE published in 2002, explaining the new\nproblems investigated and describing the proposed solutions, but without\ndwelling on theoretical details, which can be found in the original articles. I\nhope that this paper will be useful both to researchers who like to learn more\non the research carried out in SAE and to practitioners who might be interested\nin the application of the new methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Feb 2013 14:10:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-21"}

In agreement with the idea that\na belief set (in the sense of Gardenfors) must be closed under logical\nconsequence, it is also required that the separate acceptance o two\npropositions entail the acceptance of their conjunction.

We give an algorithm to implement the transform. We show how\nto use the transform algorithm as a generator of a whole family of inferencing\nalgorithms for circumscription. The method is to employ the transform algorithm\nas a front end to any inferencing algorithm, e.g., one of the previously\navailable, that handles the parallel (empty) case of prioritization. Our\nalgorithms provide not just coverage of a new expressive class, but also\nalternatives to previous algorithms for implementing the previously covered\nclass (?layered?) of prioritization. In particular, we give a new\nquery-answering algorithm for prioritized cirumscription which is sound and\ncomplete for the full expressive class of unrestricted finite prioritization\npartial orders, for propositional defaults (or minimized predicates). By\ncontrast, previous algorithms required that the prioritization partial order be\nlayered, i.e., structured similar to the system of rank in the military. Our\nalgorithm enables, for the first time, the implementation of the most useful\nclass of prioritization: non-layered prioritization partial orders. Default\ninheritance, for example, typically requires non-layered prioritization to\nrepresent specificity adequately. Our algorithm enables not only the\nimplementation of default inheritance (and specificity) within prioritized\ncircumscription, but also the extension and combination of default inheritance\nwith other kinds of prioritized default reasoning, e.g.: with stratified logic\nprograms with negation-as-failure. Such logic programs are previously known to\nbe representable equivalently as layered-priority predicate circumscriptions.\nWorst-case, the transform increases the number of defaults exponentially. We\ndiscuss how inferencing is practically implementable nevertheless in two kinds\nof situations: general expressiveness but small numbers of defaults, or\nexpressive special cases with larger numbers of defaults. One such expressive\nspecial case is non-?top-heaviness? of the prioritization partial order. In\naddition to its direct implementation, the transform can also be exploited\nanalytically to generate special case algorithms, e.g., a tractable transform\nfor a class within default inheritance (detailed in another, forthcoming\npaper). We discuss other aspects of the significance of the fundamental result.\nOne can view the transform as reducing n degrees of partially ordered belief\nconfidence to just 2 degrees of confidence: for-sure and (unprioritized)\ndefault. Ordinary, parallel default reasoning, e.g., in parallel\ncircumscription or Poole's Theorist, can be viewed in these terms as reducing 2\ndegrees of confidence to just 1 degree of confidence: that of the non-monotonic\ntheory's conclusions. The expressive reduction's computational complexity\nsuggests that prioritization is valuable for its expressive conciseness, just\nas defaults are for theirs. For Reiter's Default Logic and Poole's Theorist,\nthe transform implies how to extend those formalisms so as to equip them with a\nconcept of prioritization that is exactly equivalent to that in\ncircumscription. This provides an interesting alternative to Brewka's approach\nto equipping them with prioritization-type precedence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Feb 2013 15:20:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-21"}

We\nshow how we can exploit a hierarchical system specification to make this\napproach tractable for large systems. When introducing hierarchy, we also\nconsider the tradeoff between simply replacing a component and decomposing it\nto repair its subcomponents. The hierarchical repair algorithm is suitable for\noff-line precomputation of an optimal repair strategy. A modification of the\nalgorithm takes advantage of an iterative deepening scheme to trade off\ninference time and the quality of the computed strategy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Feb 2013 15:23:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-21"}

Then, using the\nMathematica technical computing software, curve fitting is employed to\ndetermine the functions which best reflect how surpluses and deficits\naccumulate with time. It is shown that both EU and the Eurozone economies\nultimately have to pass through a critical, turning point beyond which the\naccumulation of deficits exceeds the accumulation of surpluses thus marking a\nperiod of instability. An interval estimate at a ninety eight percent degree of\nconfidence, yields that EU is found in a phase of instability since 2011 while\nthe instability turning point for the Eurozone is bound to occur any year from\n2015 to 2018.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Feb 2013 19:10:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-26"}
