While several\ntopological insulator materials are currently known, the existence and topology\nof these metallic states have only ever been probed for one particular surface\norientation of a given material. For most topological insulators, such as\nBi$_{1-x}$Sb$_{x}$ and Bi$_2$Se$_3$, this surface is the closed-packed (111)\nsurface and it supports one topologically guaranteed surface state Dirac cone.\nHere we experimentally realise a non closed-packed surface of a topological\ninsulator, Bi$_{1-x}$Sb$_{x}$(110), and probe the surface state topology by\nangle-resolved photoemission. As expected, this surface also supports metallic\nstates but the change in surface orientation drastically modifies the band\ntopology, leading to three Dirac cones instead of one, in excellent agreement\nwith the theoretical predictions but in contrast to any other experimentally\nstudied TI surface. This illustrates the possibility to tailor the basic\ntopological properties of the surface via its crystallographic direction. Here\nit introduces a valley degree of freedom not previously achieved for\ntopological insulator systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Feb 2013 16:07:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-07"}

It is an approach to study\nthe macro-behavior of a medium by its micro-properties. In mathematics,\nhomogenization theory considers the limitations of the sequences of the\nproblems and its solutions when a parameter tends to zero. This parameter is\nregarded as the ratio of the characteristic size in the micro scale to that in\nthe macro scale. So what is considered is a sequence of problems in a fixed\ndomain while the characteristic size in micro scale tends to zero. But for the\nreal situations in physics or engineering, the micro scale of a medium is fixed\nand can not be changed. In the process of homogenization, it is the size in\nmacro scale which becomes larger and larger and tends to infinity. We observe\nthat the homogenization in physics is not equivalent to the homogenization in\nmathematics up to some simple rescaling. With some direct error estimates, we\nexplain in what means we can accept the homogenized problem as the limitation\nof the original real physical problems. As a byproduct, we present some results\non the mathematical homogenization of some problems with source term being only\nweakly compacted in $H^{-1}$, while in standard homogenization theory, the\nsource term is assumed to be at least compacted in $H^{-1}$. A real example is\nalso given to show the validation of our observation and results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Feb 2013 17:01:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-05"}

While prior studies have indicated the presence of light flavor quark\n(2SC) or symmetric color-flavor-locked (CFL) pairing at low temperatures, we\nfind that in the absence of a local color neutrality constraint the inclusion\nof the Polyakov loop gives rise to phases in which all quark colors and flavors\npair, but with unequal magnitudes. We study this asymmetric color-flavor-locked\n(ACFL) phase, which can exist even for equal mass quarks, identifying its\nlocation in the phase diagram, the order of the associated phase transitions,\nand its symmetry breaking pattern, which proves to be the intersection of the\nsymmetry groups of the 2SC and CFL phases. We also investigate the effects of\nthe strange quark mass on this new phase and the QCD phase diagram generally.\nFinally, we analyze the effect of a local color neutrality constraint on these\nphases of asymmetric pairing. We observe that for massless quarks the\nneutrality constraint renders the 2SC phase energetically unfavorable,\neliminating it at low temperatures, and giving rise to the previously proposed\nlow temperature critical point, with associated continuity between the hadronic\nand ACFL phases. For realistic strange quark masses, however, the neutrality\nconstraint shrinks the 2SC region of the phase diagram, but does not eliminate\nit, at T=0.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Feb 2013 18:58:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Jul 2013 06:06:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-16"}

Separable inverse problems are a powerful\ngeneralization in which the transformation itself depends on additional unknown\nparameters and we wish to determine both sets of parameters simultaneously.\nWhen separable problems are solved by optimization, convergence can often be\naccelerated by elimination of the linear variables, a strategy which appears\nmost prominently in the variable projection methods due to Golub, Pereyra, and\nKaufman. Existing variable elimination methods require an explicit formula for\nthe optimal value of the linear variables, so they cannot be used in problems\nwith Poisson likelihoods, bound constraints, or other important departures from\nleast squares.\n  To address this limitation, we propose a generalization of variable\nelimination in which standard optimization methods are modified to behave as\nthough a variable has been eliminated.

Discriminating between these two evolutionary\nforces, based on a time series of samples from a population, remains an\noutstanding problem with increasing relevance to modern data sets. Even in the\nidealized situation when the sampled locus is independent of all other loci\nthis problem is difficult to solve, especially when the size of the population\nfrom which the samples are drawn is unknown. A standard $\\chi^2$-based\nlikelihood ratio test was previously proposed to address this problem.

The\nframework for analysing such models in response to weak perturbations is now\nparticularly well advanced, and has allowed for the development of a theory of\nweakly connected neural networks. However, the strong-attraction assumption may\nwell not be the natural one for many neural oscillator models. For example, the\npopular conductance based Morris-Lecar model is known to respond to periodic\npulsatile stimulation in a chaotic fashion that cannot be adequately described\nwith a phase reduction. In this paper, we generalise the phase description that\nallows one to track the evolution of distance from the cycle as well as phase\non cycle. We use a classical technique from the theory of ordinary differential\nequations that makes use of a moving coordinate system to analyse periodic\norbits. The subsequent phase-amplitude description is shown to be very well\nsuited to understanding the response of the oscillator to external stimuli\n(which are not necessarily weak). We consider a number of examples of neural\noscillator models, ranging from planar through to high dimensional models, to\nillustrate the effectiveness of this approach in providing an improvement over\nthe standard phase-reduction technique. As an explicit application of this\nphase-amplitude framework, we consider in some detail the response of a generic\nplanar model where the strong-attraction assumption does not hold, and examine\nthe response of the system to periodic pulsatile forcing. In addition, we\nexplore how the presence of dynamical shear can lead to a chaotic response.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Feb 2013 11:44:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-05"}

Most existing works depend heavily on the outlier\nsegmentation to remove the outlier effect in the registration. Moreover, these\nworks do not handle simultaneously the missing correspondences and local large\ndeformations. In this paper, we defined the nonrigid image registration as a\nlocal adaptive kernel regression which locally reconstruct the moving image's\ndense deformation vectors from the sparse deformation vectors in the\nmulti-resolution block matching. The kernel function of the kernel regression\nadapts its shape and orientation to the reference image's structure to gather\nmore deformation vector samples of the same structure for the iterative\nregression computation, whereby the moving image's local deformations could be\ncompliant with the reference image's local structures. To estimate the local\ndeformations around the outliers, we use joint saliency map that highlights the\ncorresponding saliency structures (called Joint Saliency Structures, JSSs) in\nthe two images to guide the dense deformation reconstruction by emphasizing\nthose JSSs' sparse deformation vectors in the kernel regression.

The settling\nregime of accretion is possible for moderate X-ray luminosities L <4 10^36\nerg/s. At higher luminosities a free-fall gap above the NS magnetosphere\nappears due to rapid Compton cooling, and accretion becomes highly\nnon-stationary.
