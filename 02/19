Our equations indicate there are two distinct classes of\nponderomotive effect induced by Alfven waves in general 2.5D MHD, each with\nboth a longitudinal and transverse manifestation; i) Geometric Effects:\nGradients in the pulse geometry relative to the background magnetic field cause\nthe wave to sustain cospatial disturbances, the longitudinal and transverse\ndaughter disturbances - where we report on the transverse disturbance for the\nfirst time. ii) Grad (c_A) Effects: Where a pulse propagates through an\ninhomogeneous region (where the non-zero gradients in the Alfven-speed profile\nare non-zero), the nonlinear magnetic-pressure gradient acts to accelerate the\nplasma.

Three of the four\nmodes measured by THz and Raman spectroscopies were recently identified using a\nsimple microscopic model. While a Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction $D$\nalong $[-1,2,-1]$ induces the cycloid with wavevector $(2\\pi /a)(0.5+\\delta,\n0.5, 0.5-\\delta)$ ($\\delta \\approx 0.0045$), easy-axis anisotropy $K$ along the\n$[1,1,1]$ direction of the electric polarization ${\\bf P}$ induces higher\nharmonics of the cycloid, which split the $\\Psi_1$ modes at 2.49 and 2.67 meV\nand activate the $\\Phi_2$ mode at 3.38 meV. However, that model could not\nexplain the observed low-frequency mode at about 2.17 meV.

It has\nbecome a standard technique in functional neuroimaging. In functional\nneuroimaging, so called group ICA (gICA) seeks to identify and quantify\nnetworks of correlated regions across subjects. This paper reports on the\ndevelopment of a new group ICA approach, Homotopic Group ICA (H-gICA), for\nblind source separation of resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging\n(fMRI) data. Resting state brain functional homotopy is the similarity of\nspontaneous fluctuations between bilaterally symmetrically opposing regions\n(i.e. those symmetric with respect to the mid-sagittal plane) (Zuo et al.,\n2010). The approach we proposed improves network estimates by leveraging this\nknown brain functional homotopy. H-gICA increases the potential for network\ndiscovery, effectively by averaging information across hemispheres. It is\ntheoretically proven to be identical to standard group ICA when the true\nsources are both perfectly homotopic and noise-free, while simulation studies\nand data explorations demonstrate its benefits in the presence of noise.\nMoreover, compared to commonly applied group ICA algorithms, the structure of\nthe H-gICA input data leads to significant improvement in computational\nefficiency. A simulation study comfirms its effectiveness in homotopic,\nnon-homotopic and mixed settings, as well as on the landmark ADHD-200 dataset.\nFrom a relatively small subset of data, several brain networks were found\nincluding: the visual, the default mode and auditory networks, as well as\nothers. These were shown to be more contiguous and clearly delineated than the\ncorresponding ordinary group ICA. Finally, in addition to improving network\nestimation, H-gICA facilitates the investigation of functional homotopy via\nICA-based networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Feb 2013 18:05:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-19"}

A bivariate\nrandom vector $(X,N)$ follows BGG law if $N$ has geometric distribution and $X$\nmay be represented (in law) as a sum of $N$ independent and identically\ndistributed gamma variables, where these variables are independent of $N$.\nStatistical properties such as moment generation and characteristic functions,\nmoments and variance-covariance matrix are provided. The marginal and\nconditional laws are also studied. We show that BBG distribution is infinitely\ndivisible, just as BEG model is. Further, we provide alternative\nrepresentations for the BGG distribution and show that it enjoys a geometric\nstability property. Maximum likelihood estimation and inference are discussed\nand a reparametrization is proposed in order to obtain orthogonality of the\nparameters.

The least cardinal number k such\nthat (G,V) is k-distinguishable is its distinguishing number. In particular, a\ngraph X is k-distinguishable if its automorphism group Aut(X) has\ndistinguishing number at most k in its action on the vertices of X.\n  Various results in the literature demonstrate that when an infinite graph\nfails to have some property, then often some finite subgraph is similarly\ndeficient. In this paper we show that whenever an infinite connected graph X is\nnot k-distinguishable (for a given cardinal k), then it contains a ball B of\nfinite radius whose distinguishing number is at least k. Moreover, this lower\nbound cannot be sharpened, since for any integer k greater than 3 there exists\nan infinite, locally finite, connected graph X that is not k-distinguishable\nbut in which every ball of finite radius is k-distinguishable.\n  In the second half of this paper we show that a large distinguishing number\nfor an imprimitive graph X is traceable to a high distinguishing number either\nof a block of imprimitivity or of the induced action of Aut(X) on the\ncorresponding system of imprimitivity. The distinguishing numbers of infinite\nprimitive graphs have been examined in detail in a previous paper by the\nauthors together with Tom W.

We\npresent a series of idealized numerical experiments, performed with the\nradiation-hydrodynamic code ORION, in which we study the dynamics of such winds\nand quantify their properties. We find that, after wind acceleration begins,\nradiation Rayleigh-Taylor instability forces the gas into a configuration that\nreduces the rate of momentum transfer from the radiation field to the gas by a\nfactor ~ 10 - 100 compared to an estimate based on the optical depth at the\nbase of the atmosphere; instead, the rate of momentum transfer from a driving\nradiation field of luminosity L to the gas is roughly L/c multiplied by one\nplus half the optical depth evaluated using the photospheric temperature, which\nis far smaller than the optical depth one would obtain using the interior\ntemperature.

Most CEMP stars are\nalso enriched in s-process elements and these are often found in binary\nsystems. This suggests that the carbon enrichment is due to mass transfer in\nthe past from an asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star on to a low-mass companion.\nModels of binary population synthesis are not able to reproduce the observed\nfraction of CEMP stars without invoking non-standard nucleosynthesis or a\nsubstantial change in the initial mass function. This is interpreted as\nevidence of missing physical ingredients in the models. Recent hydrodynamical\nsimulations show that efficient wind mass transfer is possible in the case of\nthe slow and dense winds typical of AGB stars through a mechanism called wind\nRoche-lobe overflow (WRLOF), which lies in between the canonical\nBondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) accretion and Roche-lobe overflow. WRLOF has an\neffect on the accretion efficiency of mass transfer and on the angular momentum\nlost by the binary system. The aim of this work is to understand the overall\neffect of WRLOF on the population of CEMP stars. To simulate populations of\nlow-metallicity binaries we combined a synthetic nucleosynthesis model with a\nbinary population synthesis code. In this code we implemented the WRLOF\nmechanism. We used the results of hydrodynamical simulations to model the\neffect of WRLOF on the accretion efficiency and we took the effect on the\nangular momentum loss into account by assuming a simple prescription. As a\nresult the number of CEMP stars predicted by our model increases by a factor\n1.2-1.8 compared to earlier results that consider the BHL prescription.\nMoreover, higher enrichments of carbon are produced and the final orbital\nperiod distribution is shifted towards shorter periods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Feb 2013 21:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

We find that the mass loss is\nexpected to occur through a steady wind over many tens of free-fall times (t_ff\n~ 10 Myr) rather than by an explosive disruption in one or a few t_ff. Our\nanalysis is based on the finding from simulations that radiation trapping is\nnegligible because it destabilizes the wind (Krumholz & Thompson 2012, 2013).\nEach photon can therefore contribute to the wind momentum only once, so the\nradiative force is limited to L/c. When combining radiation, protostellar and\nmain-sequence winds, and supernovae, we estimate the total direct injection\nrate of momentum into the outflow to be 2.5 L/c. The adiabatic phase of\nsupernovae and main-sequence winds can double this rate. The resulting outflow\nmass-loading factor is of order unity, and if the clumps were to deplete their\ngas the timescale would have been a few disk orbital times, to end with half\nthe original clump mass in stars. However, the clump migration time to the disk\ncenter is on the order of an orbital time, about 250 Myr, so the clumps are\nexpected to complete their migration prior to depletion. Furthermore, the\nclumps are expected to double their mass in a disk orbital time by accretion\nfrom the disk and clump-clump mergers, so their mass actually grows in time and\nwith decreasing radius. From the 6-7 giant clumps with observed outflows, 5 are\nconsistent with these predictions, and one has a much higher mass-loading\nfactor and momentum injection rate. The latter either indicates that the\nestimated outflow is an overestimate (within the 1-sigma error), that the SFR\nhas dropped since the time when the outflow was launched, or that the driving\nmechanism is different, e.g. supernova feedback in a cavity generated by the\nother feedbacks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Feb 2013 21:05:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 Mar 2013 03:23:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

The GOALS sample of 244 nuclei\nin 180 luminous and 22 ultraluminous IR galaxies represents a complete subset\nof the IRAS RBGS and covers a range of merger stages, morphologies and spectral\ntypes. The majority (>60%) of GOALS LIRGs have high 6.2um PAH equivalent widths\n(EQW > 0.4um) and low levels of silicate absorption (s_9.7um >-1.0). There is a\ngeneral trend among the U/LIRGs for silicate depth and MIR slope to increase\nwith LIR. U/LIRGs in the late stages of a merger also have on average steeper\nMIR slopes and higher levels of dust obscuration. Together these trends suggest\nthat as gas & dust is funneled towards the center of a coalescing merger, the\nnuclei become more compact and obscured. The sources that depart from these\ncorrelations have very low PAH EQW (EQW < 0.1um) consistent with their MIR\nemission being dominated by an AGN. The most heavily dust obscured sources are\nthe most compact in their MIR emission, suggesting that the obscuring (cool)\ndust is associated with the outer regions of the starburst. As the merger\nprogresses a marked decline is seen for the fraction of high EQW (star\nformation dominated) sources while the fraction of composite sources increases\nbut the fraction of AGN-dominated sources remains low.

Pulsar acceleration implies a hard injection spectrum ($\\sim\nE^{-1}$) due to pulsar spin down and a maximum energy $E_{\\rm max} \\sim Z \\,\n10^{19}$ eV due to the limit on the spin rate of neutron stars. We have\npreviously shown that the escape through the young supernova remnant softens\nthe spectrum, decreases slightly the maximum energy, and generates secondary\nnuclei. Here we show that the distribution of pulsar birth periods and the\neffect of propagation in the interstellar and intergalactic media modifies the\ncombined spectrum of all pulsars. By assuming a normal distribution of pulsar\nbirth periods centered at 300 ms, we show that the contribution of\nextragalactic pulsar births to the ultrahigh energy cosmic ray spectrum\nnaturally gives rise to a contribution to very high energy cosmic rays (VHECRs,\nbetween $10^{16}$ and $10^{18}$ eV) by Galactic pulsar births. The required\ninjected composition to fit the observed spectrum depends on the absolute\nenergy scale, which is uncertain, differing between Auger Observatory and\nTelescope Array. The contribution of Galactic pulsar births can also bridge the\ngap between predictions for cosmic ray acceleration in supernova remnants and\nthe observed spectrum just below the ankle, depending on the composition of the\ncosmic rays that escape the supernova remnant and the diffusion behavior of\nVHECRs in the Galaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Feb 2013 23:32:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

In strongly elastic flows, we show that disturbances with large\nstreamwise length scales may be significantly amplified even in the absence of\ninertia. For fluctuations without streamwise variations, we derive explicit\nanalytical expressions for the dependence of the worst-case amplification (from\ndifferent forcing to different velocity and polymer stress components) on the\nWeissenberg number ($We$), the maximum extensibility of the polymer chains\n($L$), the viscosity ratio, and the spanwise wavenumber. For the Oldroyd-B\nmodel, the amplification of the most energetic components of velocity and\npolymer stress fields scales as $We^2$ and $We^4$. On the other hand, finite\nextensibility of polymer molecules limits the largest achievable amplification\neven in flows with infinitely large Weissenberg numbers: in the presence of\nwall-normal and spanwise forces the amplification of the streamwise velocity\nand polymer stress fluctuations is bounded by quadratic and quartic functions\nof $L$. This high amplification signals low robustness to modeling\nimperfections of inertialess channel flows of viscoelastic fluids.

In models with a finite number of possible\nconfigurations, if the microscopic dynamics is assumed to be deterministic and\nergodic and to conserve energy according to some specific pattern, and if the\nmesoscopic evolution of the global system is approximated by a Markov process\nas closely as possible, then the mesoscopic transition rates obey three\nconstraints. In the limit where macroscopic bodies can be considered as\nreservoirs at thermodynamic equilibrium (but with different intensive\nparameters) the third constraint becomes modified detailed balance (MDB) ; the\nlatter is generically expressed in terms of the microscopic exchange entropy\nvariation. We investigate the generic statistical properties for measurable\nquantities that arise from the MDB constraint.

In this paper, we focus on the problem of sampling random walks\nefficiently in a distributed network and its applications. Given bandwidth\nconstraints, the goal is to minimize the number of rounds required to obtain\nrandom walk samples.\n  All previous algorithms that compute a random walk sample of length $\\ell$ as\na subroutine always do so naively, i.e., in $O(\\ell)$ rounds. The main\ncontribution of this paper is a fast distributed algorithm for performing\nrandom walks. We present a sublinear time distributed algorithm for performing\nrandom walks whose time complexity is sublinear in the length of the walk. Our\nalgorithm performs a random walk of length $\\ell$ in $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{\\ell D})$\nrounds ($\\tilde{O}$ hides $\\polylog{n}$ factors where $n$ is the number of\nnodes in the network) with high probability on an undirected network, where $D$\nis the diameter of the network. For small diameter graphs, this is a\nsignificant improvement over the naive $O(\\ell)$ bound. Furthermore, our\nalgorithm is optimal within a poly-logarithmic factor as there exists a\nmatching lower bound [Nanongkai et al. PODC 2011]. We further extend our\nalgorithms to efficiently perform $k$ independent random walks in\n$\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{k\\ell D} + k)$ rounds.

Here we\napply our EBM to investigate the surface habitability of planets with an\nEarth-like atmospheric composition but different levels of surface pressure.\nThe habitability, defined as the mean fraction of the planet's surface on which\nliquid water could exist, is estimated from the pressure-dependent liquid water\ntemperature range, taking into account seasonal and latitudinal variations of\nsurface temperature. By running several thousands of EBM simulations we\ngenerated a map of the habitable zone (HZ) in the plane of the orbital\nsemi-major axis, a, and surface pressure, p, for planets in circular orbits\naround a Sun-like star. As pressure increases, the HZ becomes broader, with an\nincrease of 0.25 AU in its radial extent from p=1/3 bar to p=3 bar. At low\npressure, the habitability is low and varies with a; at high pressure, the\nhabitability is high and relatively constant inside the HZ. We interpret these\nresults in terms of the pressure dependence of the greenhouse effect, the\neffciency of horizontal heat transport, and the extent of the liquid water\ntemperature range. Within the limits discussed in the paper, the results can be\nextended to planets in eccentric orbits around non-solar type stars.

Up to now, however,\nnumerous searches for radio emission from extrasolar planets at radio\nwavelengths have only yielded negative results. Here we report deep radio\nobservations of the nearby Neptune-mass extrasolar transiting planet HAT-P-11b\nat 150 MHz, using the Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope (GMRT). On July 16, 2009,\nwe detected a 3-sigma emission whose light curve is consistent with an eclipse\nwhen the planet passed behind the star. This emission is at a position 14\narcsec from the transiting exoplanet's coordinates; thus, with a synthetized\nbeam of FWHM~16 arcsec, the position uncertainty of this weak radio signal\nencompasses the location of HAT-P-11. We estimate a 5% false positive\nprobability that the observed radio light curve mimics the planet's eclipse\nlight curve. If the faint signature is indeed a radio eclipse event associated\nwith the planet, then its flux would be 3.87 mJy +/- 1.29 mJy at 150 MHz.\nHowever, our equally sensitive repeat observations of the system on November\n17, 2010 did not detect a significant signal in the radio light curve near the\nsame position. This lack of confirmation leaves us with the possibility of\neither a variable planetary emission, or a chance occurrence of a false\npositive signal in our first observation.

A graph\nsequence is defined to be converging if the corresponding sequence of random\nmeasures satisfies the Large Deviations Principle with respect to the topology\nof weak convergence on bounded measures on $[0,1]^d, d=1,2$. We then establish\nthat LD-convergence implies several previous notions of convergence, namely\nso-called right-convergence, left-convergence, and partition-convergence. The\ncorresponding large deviation rate function can be interpreted as the limit\nobject of the sparse graph sequence. In particular, we can express the limiting\nfree energies in terms of this limit object.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Feb 2013 14:16:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-20"}

However, certain\nfundamental questions remain: What sorts of measurement vectors uniquely\ndetermine every signal up to a global phase factor, and how many are needed to\ndo so? Furthermore, which measurement ensembles lend stability? This paper\npresents several results that address each of these questions. We begin by\ncharacterizing injectivity, and we identify that the complement property is\nindeed a necessary condition in the complex case. We then pose a conjecture\nthat 4M-4 generic measurement vectors are both necessary and sufficient for\ninjectivity in M dimensions, and we prove this conjecture in the special cases\nwhere M=2,3. Next, we shift our attention to stability, both in the worst and\naverage cases. Here, we characterize worst-case stability in the real case by\nintroducing a numerical version of the complement property. This new property\nbears some resemblance to the restricted isometry property of compressed\nsensing and can be used to derive a sharp lower Lipschitz bound on the\nintensity measurement mapping. Localized frames are shown to lack this property\n(suggesting instability), whereas Gaussian random measurements are shown to\nsatisfy this property with high probability. We conclude by presenting results\nthat use a stochastic noise model in both the real and complex cases, and we\nleverage Cramer-Rao lower bounds to identify stability with stronger versions\nof the injectivity characterizations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Feb 2013 14:31:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Mar 2013 21:06:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 14 Oct 2013 23:52:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-16"}

A previous simulation study (Guillot\nand Sator (2011) GCA 75, 1829-1857) has shown that the solubility of CO2 in\nbasaltic melts increases steadily with the pressure and deviates significantly\nfrom Henry's law at high pressures (e.g. 9.5 wt% CO2 at 50 kbar as compared\nwith 2.5 wt% from Henry's law). From the CO2 solubility curve and the equations\nof state of the two coexisting phases (silicate melt and supercritical CO2),\ndeduced from the MD simulation, we have evaluated the evolution of the\nvesicularity of a MORB melt at depth as function of its initial CO2 contents.\nAn excellent agreement is obtained between calculations and data on MORB\nsamples collected at oceanic ridges. Moreover, by implementing the test\nparticle method (Guillot and Sator (2012) GCA 80, 51-69), the solubility of\nnoble gases in the two coexisting phases (supercritical CO2 and CO2-saturated\nmelt), the partitioning and the fractionation of noble gases between melt and\nvesicles have been evaluated as function of the pressure. We show that the\nmelt/CO2 partition coefficients of noble gases increase significantly with the\npressure whereas the large distribution of the 4He/40Ar* ratio reported in the\nliterature is explained if the magma experiences a suite of vesiculation and\nvesicle loss during ascent. By applying a pressure drop to a volatile bearing\nmelt, the MD simulation reveals the main steps of bubble formation and noble\ngas transfer at the nanometric scale. A key result is that the transfer of\nnoble gases is found to be driven by CO2 bubble nucleation, a finding which\nsuggests that the diffusivity difference between He and Ar in the degassing\nmelt has virtually no effect on the 4He/40Ar* ratio measured in the vesicles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Feb 2013 15:03:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-22"}

We start with\nan extremal five-dimensional Myers-Perry black hole seed in which the two\npossible angular momenta have equal magnitude, and add Born-Infeld electrical\ncharge keeping the extremality condition as a constraint. The perturbative\nparameter is assumed to be the electric charge $q$ and the perturbations are\nperformed up to 4th order. We also study some physical properties of these\nblack holes. It is shown that the perturbative parameter $q$ and the\nBorn-Infeld parameter $\\beta$ modify the values of the physical quantities of\nthe black holes. The solution suggests that the magnetic moment and\ngyromagnetic ratio of the black hole spacetime change sign when the Born-Infeld\ncharacter of the solution starts to depart strongly from the Maxwell limit. We\nventure an interpretation for the effect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Feb 2013 15:06:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-18"}
