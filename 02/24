In this paper we address this challenge by\nmeasuring the visual complexity of two common forms of cluster-based\nvisualizations: scatter plots and parallel coordinatess. We conceptualize\nvisual complexity as a form of visual uncertainty, which is a measure of the\ndegree of difficulty for humans to interpret a visual representation correctly.\nWe propose an algorithm for estimating visual complexity for the aforementioned\nvisualizations using Allen's interval algebra. We first establish a set of\nprimitive 2-cluster cases in scatter plots and another set for parallel\ncoordinatess based on symmetric isomorphism. We confirm that both are the\nminimal sets and verify the correctness of their members computationally. We\nscore the uncertainty of each primitive case based on its topological\nproperties, including the existence of overlapping regions, splitting regions\nand meeting points or edges. We compare a few optional scoring schemes against\na set of subjective scores by humans, and identify the one that is the most\nconsistent with the subjective scores. Finally, we extend the 2-cluster measure\nto k-cluster measure as a general purpose estimator of visual complexity for\nthese two forms of cluster-based visualization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Feb 2013 16:34:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-26"}

The problem is classical in\nthe case of small-amplitude oscillations, for which an analytical expression of\nthe force can be easily obtained, and predicts attraction of sub- resonant\nbubbles by pressure antinodes. But for high-amplitude sound fields, the bubbles\nundergo large amplitude nonlinear oscillations, so that no analytical\nexpression of the force is available in this case. The bubble dynamics is\napproximated on physical grounds, following the method of Hilgenfeldt et al.\n[J. Fluid Mech., 365, 171 (1998)], but carefully accounting for surface\ntension. The analytical expression of the maximum radius of the bubble is\nrecovered, the time of maximum expansion is noticeably refined, and an\nestimation of the collapse-time is found. An analytical expression for the\ntime-varying bubble volume is deduced, and the Bjerknes force is obtained in\nclosed form. The result is valid for any shape of the sound field, including\npurely standing or purely traveling waves, and is ready to use in a theoretical\nmodel of bubble clouds evolution. Besides, the well-known sign inversion of the\nBjerknes force for large standing waves is recovered and the inversion\nthreshold in the parameter space is obtained analytically. The results are in\ngood agreement with numerical simulation and allow a quantitative assessment of\nthe physical parameters effect. It is found that either reducing surface\ntension, or increasing the static pressure, should produce a widening of the\nbubble-free region near high-amplitude pressure antinodes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Feb 2013 19:02:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-26"}

In this work we propose two methods to estimate the\noffspring distribution from real sampled data.

Both quantities and calculated numerically for a single\ninertial bubble driven at 20 kHz, and are found to be several orders of\nmagnitude larger than the linear prediction. Viscous dissipation is found to be\nthe predominant cause of energy loss for bubbles small enough.

Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression often turns\nout to be a useful model in these situations since it performs dimensionality\nreduction by assuming the existence of a small number of latent factors that\nmay explain the linear dependence between input and output. In practice, the\nnumber of latent factors to be retained, which controls the complexity of the\nmodel and its predictive ability, has to be carefully selected. Typically this\nis done by cross validating a performance measure, such as the predictive\nerror. Although cross validation works well in many practical settings, it can\nbe computationally expensive. Various extensions to PLS have also been proposed\nfor regularising the PLS solution and performing simultaneous dimensionality\nreduction and variable selection, but these come at the expense of additional\ncomplexity parameters that also need to be tuned by cross-validation. In this\npaper we derive a computationally efficient alternative to leave-one-out cross\nvalidation (LOOCV), a predicted sum of squares (PRESS) statistic for two-block\nPLS. We show that the PRESS is nearly identical to LOOCV but has the\ncomputational expense of only a single PLS model fit. Examples of the PRESS for\nselecting the number of latent factors and regularisation parameters are\nprovided.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Feb 2013 23:05:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-26"}

In particular,\nonly the end-to-end description of the channel as being capable of\ncommunicating a source to within a certain distortion level is used when\nproving separation. This implies that the channel model does not play any role\nfor separation to hold as long as there is a source model.

This study explores these\nsynchronization/desynchronization patterns. We employ recently developed\ntechniques to analyze the fine temporal structure of phase-locking to study the\ntemporal patterning of synchrony of the human brain rhythms. We study neural\noscillations recorded by EEG in $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ frequency bands in healthy\nhuman subjects at rest and during the execution of a task. While the\nphase-locking strength depends on many factors, dynamics of synchrony has a\nvery specific temporal pattern: synchronous states are interrupted by frequent,\nbut short desynchronization episodes. The probability for a desynchronization\nepisode to occur decreased with its duration. The transition matrix between\nsynchronized and desynchronized states has eigenvalues close to 0 and 1 where\neigenvalue 1 has multiplicity 1, and therefore if the stationary distribution\nbetween these states is perturbed, the system converges back to the stationary\ndistribution very fast. The qualitative similarity of this patterning across\ndifferent subjects, brain states and electrode locations suggests that this may\nbe a general type of dynamics for the brain. Earlier studies indicate that not\nall oscillatory networks have this kind of patterning of\nsynchronization/desynchronization dynamics. Thus the observed prevalence of\nshort (but potentially frequent) desynchronization events (length of one cycle\nof oscillations) may have important functional implications for the brain.\nNumerous short desynchronizations (as opposed to infrequent, but long\ndesynchronizations) may allow for a quick and efficient formation and break-up\nof functionally significant neuronal assemblies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Feb 2013 03:49:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-11"}

High resolution\nspectroscopic observations of the off-limb corona were made using 25 cm\nNorikura coronagraph, located at Norikura, Japan. Observations on a number of\ndays, were made simultaneously in four forbidden iron emission lines namely,\n[Fe XI] 7892 \\AA\\ line, [Fe XIII] 10747 \\AA & 10798 \\AA\\ lines and [Fe XIV]\n5303 \\AA\\ line and on some days made only in [Fe XI] 7892 \\AA\\ and [Fe X] 6374\n\\AA\\ lines.

Combining these results with the\nprevious investigations by Singh and his collaborators, we infer that the loop\ntops, in general, appear hotter when observed in colder lines and colder when\nobserved in relatively hotter lines as compared to their coronal foot points.\nWe suggest that this contrasting trend observed in the temperature variation\nalong the loop structures can be explained by a gradual interaction of\ndifferent temperature plasma. The exact mechanism responsible for this\ninteraction needs further quest and has potential to constrain loop heating\nmodels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Feb 2013 13:39:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

We\nshow that in early-type galaxies, a population of accreting white dwarfs large\nenough to reproduce the SN Ia rate would contribute significantly to the\nionizing UV radiation expected from the stellar population.

In this work, the significance of\nsuch processes for solar atmosphere is studied. In the case of the solar\natmosphere the absorption processes with $A=$ H and $B=$ Mg and Si are treated\nas dominant ones, but the cases $A=$ H and $B=$ Al and $A=$ He and $B=$ H are\nalso taken into consideration. The choice of just these species is caused by\nthe fact that, of the species relevant for the used solar-atmosphere model, it\nwas only for them that we could determine the necessary characteristics of the\ncorresponding molecular ions, i.e. the molecular potential curves and dipole\nmatrix elements. It is shown that the efficiency of the examined non-symmetric\nprocesses within the rather wide corresponding quasi-molecular absorption bands\nin the far-UV and EUV regions is comparable and sometimes even greater than the\nintensity of the known symmetric ion-atom absorption processes, which are\nincluded now in the models of the solar atmosphere. Consequently, the presented\nresults suggest that the non-symmetric ion-atom absorption processes also have\nto be included \\emph{ab initio} in the corresponding models of the stellar\natmospheres.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Feb 2013 14:39:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-26"}
