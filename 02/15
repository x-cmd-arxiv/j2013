It is known, e.g., by the\nsuccess of CPLEX, that preprocessing and simplification can greatly speed up\nthe process of optimizing an ILP. The present work seeks to further the\ntheoretical understanding of preprocessing for ILPs by initiating a rigorous\nstudy within the framework of parameterized complexity and kernelization.\n  A famous result of Lenstra (Mathematics of Operations Research, 1983) shows\nthat feasibility of any ILP with n variables and m constraints can be decided\nin time O(c^{n^3} m^c'). Thus, by a folklore argument, any such ILP admits a\nkernelization to an equivalent instance of size O(c^{n^3}). It is known, that\nunless NP \\subseteq coNP/poly and the polynomial hierarchy collapses, no\nkernelization with size bound polynomial in n is possible. However, this lower\nbound only applies for the case when constraints may include an arbitrary\nnumber of variables since it follows from lower bounds for Satisfiability and\nHitting Set, whose bounded arity variants admit polynomial kernelizations.\n  We consider the feasibility problem for ILPs Ax<= b where A is an\nr-row-sparse matrix parameterized by the number of variables. We show that the\nkernelizability of this problem depends strongly on the range of the variables.\nIf the range is unbounded then this problem does not admit a polynomial\nkernelization unless NP \\subseteq coNP/poly. If, on the other hand, the range\nof each variable is polynomially bounded in n then we do get a polynomial\nkernelization. Additionally, this holds also for the more general case when the\nmaximum range d is an additional parameter, i.e., the size obtained is\npolynomial in n+d.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Feb 2013 18:01:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 Feb 2013 19:23:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-18"}

The\nboundary layer flow is known to develop unstable Tollmien-Schlichting waves\nabove a critical value of the Reynolds number. However, it is also known that\nthis transition can be observed for sub-critical Reynolds numbers. In that\ncase, the basin of attraction of the laminar state coexists with the sustained\nturbulence. In this article, the trajectory on the separatrix between these two\nstates is simulated. The state on the separatrix is independent from the\ninitial condition and is dynamically connected to both the laminar flow and the\nturbulence. Such an edge state provides information regarding the basic\nfeatures of the transitional flow. The solution takes the form of a low speed\nstreak, flanked by two quasi-streamwise sinuous vortices. The shape of the\nstreaks is close to that simulated with the linear optimal perturbation method.\nThis solution is compared to existing results concerning streak breakdown.

The universality class of the transition\nimprints a signature on the resulting density of topological defects: It obeys\na power law in the quench rate, with an exponent dictated by a combination of\nthe critical exponents of the transition. In inhomogeneous systems the\nsituation is more complicated, as the spontaneous symmetry breaking competes\nwith bias caused by the influence of the nearby regions that already chose the\nnew vacuum. As a result, the choice of the broken symmetry vacuum may be\ninherited from the neighboring regions that have already entered the new phase.\nThis competition between the inherited and spontaneous symmetry breaking\nenhances the role of causality, as the defect formation is restricted to a\nfraction of the system where the front velocity surpasses the relevant sound\nvelocity and phase transition remains effectively homogeneous. As a\nconsequence, the overall number of topological defects can be substantially\nsuppressed. When the fraction of the system is small, the resulting total\nnumber of defects is still given by a power law related to the universality\nclass of the transition, but exhibits a more pronounced dependence on the\nquench rate. This enhanced dependence complicates the analysis but may also\nfacilitate experimental test of defect formation theories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Feb 2013 23:37:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 Sep 2013 17:34:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-13"}

In these applications, an area $a(r)$ is assigned to\neach rectangle $r$, and the actual area of $r$ in $\\mathcal{L}$ is required to\nbe $a(r)$. Moreover, some applications require that we use combinatorially\nequivalent rectangular layouts to represent multiple area assignment functions.\n$\\mathcal{L}$ is called {\\em area-universal} if any area assignment to its\nrectangles can be realized by a layout that is combinatorially equivalent to\n$\\mathcal{L}$.\n  A basic question in this area is to determine if a given plane graph $G$ has\nan area-universal rectangular layout or not.

This\nleads to a family of algorithms we collectively term Change-Point Thompson\nSampling (CTS). We show empirical results of the algorithm in 4 artificial\nenvironments, and 2 derived from real world data; news click-through[Yahoo!,\n2011] and foreign exchange data[Dukascopy, 2012], comparing them to some other\nbandit algorithms. In real world data CTS is the most effective.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Feb 2013 10:48:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-18"}

We analyzed two classes of models. In the\nisotropic models the non-universal parameters are uniform along the surface,\nwhereas in the anisotropic growth they vary.

Our numerical analysis shows that the non-universal\nparameter \\Gamma determined through the first cumulant leads to a very good\naccordance with the extended KPZ ansatz for all investigated models in contrast\nwith the estimates of \\Gamma obtained from higher order cumulants that indicate\na violation of the generalized ansatz for some of the studied models.

Our upper bounds\nare essentially optimal in terms of several important parameters.\n  Using our upper bounds, and building on prior work, we obtain the first\nP-time algorithm (in the standard Turing model of computation) for quantitative\nmodel checking, to within desired precision, of discrete-time QBDs and\n(equivalently) probabilistic 1-counter automata, with respect to any (fixed)\nomega-regular or LTL property.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Feb 2013 12:48:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 26 Apr 2013 21:55:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-30"}

The estimation of microbial\ndiversity has received renewed attention with the advent of large-scale\nmetagenomic studies. Here, we consider what the diversity observed in a sample\ntells us about the diversity of the community being sampled. First, we argue\nthat one cannot reliably estimate the absolute and relative number of microbial\nspecies present in a community without making unsupported assumptions about\nspecies abundance distributions. The reason for this is that sample data do not\ncontain information about the number of rare species in the tail of species\nabundance distributions. We illustrate the difficulty in comparing species\nrichness estimates by applying Chao's estimator of species richness to a set of\nin silico communities: they are ranked incorrectly in the presence of large\nnumbers of rare species. Next, we extend our analysis to a general family of\ndiversity metrics (\"Hill diversities\"), and construct lower and upper estimates\nof diversity values consistent with the sample data. The theory generalizes\nChao's estimator, which we retrieve as the lower estimate of species richness.\nWe show that Shannon and Simpson diversity can be robustly estimated for the in\nsilico communities. We analyze nine metagenomic data sets from a wide range of\nenvironments, and show that our findings are relevant for empirically-sampled\ncommunities.

As coagulation of dust particles is frustrated by bouncing and\nfragmentation, condensation could be a complementary, or even dominant, growth\nmode in the early stages of planet formation. Ice particles diffuse across the\nice line and sublimate, and vapour diffusing back across the ice line\nrecondenses onto already existing particles, causing them to grow. We develop a\nnumerical model of the dynamical behaviour of ice particles close to the water\nice line, approximately 3 AU from the host star. Particles move with the\nturbulent gas, modelled as a random walk. They also sediment towards the\nmidplane and drift radially towards the central star. Condensation and\nsublimation are calculated using a Monte Carlo approach. Our results indicate\nthat, with a turbulent alpha-value of 0.01, growth from millimeter to at least\ndecimeter-sized pebbles is possible on a time scale of 1000 years. We find that\nparticle growth is dominated by ice and vapour transport across the radial ice\nline, with growth due to transport across the atmospheric ice line being\nnegligible. Ice particles mix outwards by turbulent diffusion, leading to net\ngrowth across the entire cold region. The resulting particles are large enough\nto be sensitive to concentration by streaming instabilities, and in pressure\nbumps and vortices, which can cause further growth into planetesimals. In our\nmodel, particles are considered to be homogeneous ice particles. Taking into\naccount the more realistic composition of ice condensed onto rocky ice nuclei\nmight affect the growth time scales, by release of refractory ice nuclei after\nsublimation. We also ignore sticking and fragmentation in particle collisions.\nThese effects will be the subject of future investigations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Feb 2013 13:56:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 22 Feb 2013 17:10:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

We consider a typical multiscale registration setting where\nthe global 2-D translation between a pair of images is estimated by smoothing\nthe images and minimizing the distance between them with gradient descent. Our\nstudy particularly concentrates on the effect of noise and low-pass filtering\non the alignment accuracy. We adopt an analytic representation for images and\nanalyze the well-behavedness of the image distance function by estimating the\nneighborhood of translations for which it is free of undesired local minima.\nThis corresponds to the neighborhood of translation vectors that are correctly\ncomputable with a simple gradient descent minimization. We show that the area\nof this neighborhood increases at least quadratically with the smoothing filter\nsize, which justifies the use of a smoothing step in image registration with\nlocal optimizers such as gradient descent. We then examine the effect of noise\non the alignment accuracy and derive an upper bound for the alignment error in\nterms of the noise properties and filter size. Our main finding is that the\nerror increases at a rate that is at least linear with respect to the filter\nsize. Therefore, smoothing improves the well-behavedness of the distance\nfunction; however, this comes at the cost of amplifying the alignment error in\nnoisy settings. Our results provide a mathematical insight about why\nhierarchical techniques are effective in image registration, suggesting that\nthe multiscale coarse-to-fine alignment strategy of these techniques is very\nsuitable from the perspective of the trade-off between the well-behavedness of\nthe objective function and the registration accuracy.

Superconductivity ceases when the associated lateral oscillation of\nthe outer s electrons extends between neighbor atoms.

For a classical phase (i.e., the quantum\ncorrelations decay on a distance smaller than the mean inter-molecular\ndistance) the far from equilibrium kinetic equation can be cast in the form of\na Fokker-Plank equation whose phase space velocity vector maximizes the\ndissipation of the energy-type function, named here, stochastic free energy.\nNear equilibrium the maximum stochastic free energy dissipation is shown to be\ncompatible with the Prigogine s principle of minimum entropy production.\nMoreover, in the case of elastic molecular collisions and in absence of\nchemical reactions, in quasi-isothermal far from equilibrium states, the theory\nshows that the maximum stochastic free energy dissipation reduces to the\nmaximum free energy dissipation. Following the tendency to reach the highest\nrate of stochastic free energy dissipation, the system transition to states\nwith higher free energy can happen. Given that in incompressible ordinary\nfluids such an increase of free energy is almost given by a decrease of\nentropy, the matter self-organization becomes possible. When chemical reactions\nor relevant thermal gradients are present, the theory highlights that the\nSawada enunciation of maximum free energy dissipation can be violated. The\nproposed model depicts the Prigogine s principle of minimum entropy production\nnear-equilibrium and the far from equilibrium Sawada s principle of maximum\nenergy dissipation as two complementary principia of a unique theory where the\nlatter one is a particular case of the more general one of maximum stochastic\nfree energy dissipation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Feb 2013 14:05:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Mar 2013 09:49:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 8 Apr 2013 14:29:16 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 7 May 2013 09:22:04 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 9 May 2013 09:08:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-10"}
