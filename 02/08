The architecture consists of two components, an aperture assembly\nand a sensor. No lens is used. The aperture assembly consists of a two\ndimensional array of aperture elements. The transmittance of each aperture\nelement is independently controllable. The sensor is a single detection\nelement, such as a single photo-conductive cell. Each aperture element together\nwith the sensor defines a cone of a bundle of rays, and the cones of the\naperture assembly define the pixels of an image. Each pixel value of an image\nis the integration of the bundle of rays in a cone. The sensor is used for\ntaking compressive measurements. Each measurement is the integration of rays in\nthe cones modulated by the transmittance of the aperture elements. A\ncompressive sensing matrix is implemented by adjusting the transmittance of the\nindividual aperture elements according to the values of the sensing matrix. The\nproposed architecture is simple and reliable because no lens is used.\nFurthermore, the sharpness of an image from our device is only limited by the\nresolution of the aperture assembly, but not affected by blurring due to\ndefocus. The architecture can be used for capturing images of visible lights,\nand other spectra such as infrared, or millimeter waves. Such devices may be\nused in surveillance applications for detecting anomalies or extracting\nfeatures such as speed of moving objects. Multiple sensors may be used with a\nsingle aperture assembly to capture multi-view images simultaneously. A\nprototype was built by using a LCD panel and a photoelectric sensor for\ncapturing images of visible spectrum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Feb 2013 16:00:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-08"}

A large fraction of these millisecond pulsars are in\ncompact binaries with low-mass companions. These systems often show eclipses of\nthe pulsar signal and are commonly known as black widows and redbacks because\nthe pulsar is gradually destroying its companion. In this paper, we report on\nthe optical discovery of four strongly irradiated millisecond pulsar\ncompanions. All four sources show modulations of their color and luminosity at\nthe known orbital periods from radio timing. Light curve modelling of our\nexploratory data shows that the equilibrium temperature reached on the\ncompanion's dayside with respect to their nightside is consistent with about\n10-30% of the available spin-down energy from the pulsar being reprocessed to\nincrease the companion's dayside temperature. This value compares well with the\nrange observed in other irradiated pulsar binaries and offers insights about\nthe energetics of the pulsar wind and the production of gamma-ray emission. In\naddition, this provides a simple way of estimating the brightness of irradiated\npulsar companions given the pulsar spin-down luminosity. Our analysis also\nsuggests that two of the four new irradiated pulsar companions are only\npartially filling their Roche lobe. Some of these sources are relatively bright\nand represent good targets for spectroscopic follow-up. These measurements\ncould enable, among other things, mass determination of the neutron stars in\nthese systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Feb 2013 16:03:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

One of the main challenges in the analysis of fading\nnetworks, specifically multi-receiver networks including fading ICs, is to\nobtain efficient capacity outer bounds. In this paper, a novel capacity outer\nbound is established for the two-user ergodic fading IC. For this purpose, by a\nsubtle combination of broadcast channel techniques (i.e., manipulating mutual\ninformation functions composed of vector random variables by Csiszar-Korner\nidentity) and genie-aided techniques, first a single-letter outer bound\ncharacterized by mutual information functions including some auxiliary random\nvariables is derived. Then, by novel arguments the derived bound is optimized\nover its auxiliaries only using the entropy power inequality. Besides being\nwell-described, our outer bound is efficient from several aspects.\nSpecifically, it is optimal for the fading IC with uniformly strong\ninterference. Also, it is sum-rate optimal for the channel with uniformly mixed\ninterference. More importantly, it is proved that when each transmitter has\naccess to any amount of CSIT that includes the interference to noise ratio of\nits non-corresponding receiver, the outer bound differs by no more than one bit\nfrom the achievable rate region given by Han-Kobayashi scheme. This result is\nviewed as a natural generalization of the ETW to within one bit capacity result\nfor the static channel to the wireless ergodic fading case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Feb 2013 19:32:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Feb 2013 20:44:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-15"}

To obtain this result, a\nsingle-letter outer bound in terms of some auxiliary random variables is first\nestablished for the sum-rate capacity of the general IC and then those\nconditions under which this outer bound is reduced to the achievable sum-rate\ngiven by the simple treating interference as noise strategy are specified.

The effects of vector and tensor fossils can be\ndistinguished geometrically from those of scalars through the parity of the\nBiPoSHs they induce. However, the two-dimensional nature of the CMB sky does\nnot allow vectors to be distinguished geometrically from tensors. We estimate\nthe detectability of a signal in terms of the scalar-scalar-fossil coupling for\nscalar, vector, and tensor fossils, assuming a local-type coupling. We comment\non a divergence that arises in the quadrupolar BiPoSH from the\nscalar-scalar-tensor correlation in single-field slow-roll inflation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Feb 2013 21:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 12 May 2013 15:11:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-14"}

The viability of the disk fragmentation scenario for the formation of\nwide-orbit companions in protostellar disks around (sub-)solar mass stars was\ninvestigated. Methods: We used numerical hydrodynamics simulations of disk\nformation and evolution with an accurate treatment of disk thermodynamics. The\nuse of the thin-disk limit allowed us to probe the long-term evolution of\nprotostellar disks. We focused on models that produced wide-orbit GP/BD\nembryos, which opened a gap in the disk and showed radial migration timescales\nsimilar to or longer than the typical disk lifetime. Results: While disk\nfragmentation was seen in the majority of our models, only 6 models out of 60\nrevealed the formation of quasi-stable, wide-orbit GP/BD embryos. Disk\nfragmentation produced GP/BD embryos with masses in the 3.5-43 M_J range,\ncovering the whole mass spectrum of directly-imaged, wide-orbit companions to\n(sub-)solar mass stars. On the other hand, our modelling failed to produce\nembryos on orbital distances <= 170 AU, whereas several directly-imaged\ncompanions were found at smaller orbits down to a few AU.

The gravity of a subhalo in a cluster compresses the\nsurrounding intracluster gas and enhances its X-ray emission. We present a\nsimple model, which treats subhalos as slow moving and gasless, for computing\nthis effect. Recent weak lensing measurements by Okabe et al. have determined\nmasses of ~ 10^13 solar masses for three mass concentrations projected within\n300 kpc of the center of the Coma Cluster, two of which are centered on the\ngiant elliptical galaxies NGC 4889 and NGC 4874.

The agreement between the\nmodels and the X-ray morphology of the central Coma Cluster is striking. With\nsubhalo parameters from the lensing measurements, the distances of the three\nsubhalos from the Coma Cluster midplane along our line of sight are all tightly\nconstrained. Using the model to fit the subhalo masses for NGC 4889 and NGC\n4874 gives 9.1 x 10^12 and 7.6 x 10^12 solar masses, respectively, in good\nagreement with the lensing masses.

In the first\npart of this paper, I will review a set of techniques of quantum measurement\ntheory that are often used to analyze quantum optomechanical systems. Some of\nthese techniques were originally designed to analyze how a classical driving\nforce passes through a quantum system, and can eventually be detected with\noptimal signal-to-noise ratio --- while others focus more on the quantum state\nevolution of a mechanical object under continuous monitoring. In the second\npart of this paper, I will review a set of experimental concepts that will\ndemonstrate quantum mechanical behavior of macroscopic objects --- quantum\nentanglement, quantum teleportation, and the quantum Zeno effect. Taking the\ninterplay between gravity and quantum mechanics as an example, I will review a\nset of speculations on how quantum mechanics can be modified for macroscopic\nobjects, and how these speculations --- and their generalizations --- might be\ntested by optomechanics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Feb 2013 01:37:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

Applications of these circuits include proofs of theorems from algebraic\ngraph theory including the Chung-Langlands formula for the number of rooted\nspanning forests of a graph and computing Tutte Polynomials of certain\nmatroids.

We find that a-GeTe ultrathin films scaled down to about\n38 Angstrom (12 atomic layers) still shows a band gap and the electrical\nconductance is mainly due to electron transport via intra-gap states. If the\nultrathin films are further scaled, the a-GeTe band gap disappears due to\noverlap of the two metal induced gap states (MIGS) regions near the TiN\nelectrodes, leading to sharp increase of a-GeTe conductance and significant\ndecrease of c-GeTe/a-GeTe conductance ratio. The c-GeTe/a-GeTe conductance\nratio drops below one order of magnitude if the ultrathin films are scaled\nbelow about 33 Angstrom, making it difficult to reliably perform read\noperations in thin film based phase change memory devices. This overlap of the\nMIGS regions sets up the ultimate scaling limit of phase change memory\ntechnology.

At\nthe same time, the number of iterations must be enough to give a feasible\nsolution to the optimization problem and to guarantee stability of the closed\nloop system. In this paper, a stopping condition to the distributed\noptimization algorithm that guarantees these properties, is presented. The\nstopping condition is based on two theoretical contributions. First, since the\noptimization problem is solved using dual decomposition, standard techniques to\nprove stability in model predictive control (MPC), i.e. with a terminal cost\nand a terminal constraint set that involve all state variables, do not apply.\nFor the case without a terminal cost or a terminal constraint set, we present a\nnew method to quantify the control horizon needed to ensure stability and a\nprespecified performance. Second, the stopping condition is based on a novel\nadaptive constraint tightening approach. Using this adaptive constraint\ntightening approach, we guarantee that a primal feasible solution to the\noptimization problem is found and that closed loop stability and performance is\nobtained.

The dominance of the knotting by threading mechanism is not observed in\nMJ0366 folding simulations using simplified, native-centric models.

As an organizations employees need to access\nsuch information in order to carry out their daily work, data leakage detection\nis both an essential and challenging task. Whether caused by malicious intent\nor an inadvertent mistake, data loss can result in significant damage to the\norganization. Fingerprinting is a content-based method used for detecting data\nleakage. In fingerprinting, signatures of known confidential content are\nextracted and matched with outgoing content in order to detect leakage of\nsensitive content. Existing fingerprinting methods, however, suffer from two\nmajor limitations. First, fingerprinting can be bypassed by rephrasing (or\nminor modification) of the confidential content, and second, usually the whole\ncontent of document is fingerprinted (including non-confidential parts),\nresulting in false alarms. In this paper we propose an extension to the\nfingerprinting approach that is based on sorted k-skip-n-grams. The proposed\nmethod is able to produce a fingerprint of the core confidential content which\nignores non-relevant (non-confidential) sections. In addition, the proposed\nfingerprint method is more robust to rephrasing and can also be used to detect\na previously unseen confidential document and therefore provide better\ndetection of intentional leakage incidents.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Feb 2013 13:32:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-11"}

Although measurements of \\alpha have been made\nover the years for several hundred pulsars, a study of the intrinsic\ndistribution of pulsar spectra has not been carried out. From the result of\npulsar surveys carried out at three different radio frequencies, we use\npopulation synthesis techniques and a likelihood analysis to deduce what\nunderlying spectral index distribution is required to replicate the results of\nthese surveys. We find that in general the results of the surveys can be\nmodelled by a Gaussian distribution of spectral indices with a mean of -1.4 and\nunit standard deviation.

The fraction of peaked spectrum sources in\nthe population with significant turn-over at low frequencies appears to be at\nmost 10%.

This implies that any correlations between \\alpha and other\npulsar parameters (for example age or magnetic field) need to carefully account\nfor selection biases in pulsar surveys. We also expect that many known pulsars\nwhich have been detected at high frequencies will have shallow, or positive,\nspectral indices. The majority of pulsars do not have recorded flux density\nmeasurements over a wide frequency range, making it impossible to constrain\ntheir spectral shapes.

As an example of that, we prove the\nuniversal homotopy formula.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Feb 2013 15:15:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-30"}

However, the interplay between financial distress and\ntopological changes is still poorly understood. Here we analyze the quarterly\ninterbank exposures among Dutch banks over the period 1998-2008, ending with\nthe crisis. After controlling for the link density, many topological properties\ndisplay an abrupt change in 2008, providing a clear - but unpredictable -\nsignature of the crisis. By contrast, if the heterogeneity of banks'\nconnectivity is controlled for, the same properties show a gradual transition\nto the crisis, starting in 2005 and preceded by an even earlier period during\nwhich anomalous debt loops could have led to the underestimation of\ncounter-party risk. These early-warning signals are undetectable if the network\nis reconstructed from partial bank-specific data, as routinely done. We discuss\nimportant implications for bank regulatory policies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Feb 2013 15:17:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Jul 2013 10:10:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 24 Nov 2013 20:26:54 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 26 Nov 2013 15:51:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-10"}

We show that the node structure for exact\nspin symmetry is the same as the one for central potentials which go to zero at\ninfinity but for exact pseudospin symmetry the structure is reversed. We obtain\nthe important result that it is possible to have positive energy bound\nsolutions in exact pseudospin symmetry conditions for confining potentials of\nany shape, including naturally those used in hadron physics, from nuclear to\nquark models. Since this does not happen for potentials going to zero at large\ndistances, used in nuclear relativistic mean-field potentials or in the atomic\nnucleus, this shows the decisive importance of the asymptotic behavior of the\nscalar and vector central potentials on the onset of pseudospin symmetry and on\nthe node structure of the radial functions. Finally, we show that these results\nare still valid for negative energy bound solutions for anti-fermions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Feb 2013 15:49:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}
