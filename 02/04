This naturally immerges in a four dimensional\ngenerally covariant modified Yang-Mills action, which depends on the lorentzian\ncomplex structure of spacetime and not its metric. This metric independence\nmakes the model renormalizable. It is a counter example to the general belief\nthat \"string theory is the only selfconsistent quantum model which includes\ngravity\". The other properties of the model are phenomenologically very\ninteresting too. The modified Yang-Mills action generates a linear potential,\ninstead of the Coulomb-like (1/r) potential of the ordinary action. Therefore\nthe Yang-Mills excitations must be perturbatively confined. This separates the\nsolutions of the model into the vacuum bosonic sector of the periodic\nconfigurations, the \"leptonic\" sector with fermionic solitons and their gauge\nfield excitations, the \"hadronic\" sector. Simple integrability conditions of\nthe pure geometric equations imply a limited number of \"leptonic\" and\n\"hadronic\" families. The geometric surfaces are generally inside the SU(2,2)\nclassical domain. Soliton spin and gravity measure how much the surface\npenetrates inside the classical domain. The i0 point of infinity breaks the\nSU(2,2) symmetry down to the Poincare and dilation groups. A scaling breaking\nmechanism is presented. Hence the pure geometric modes and asymptotically flat\nsolitons of the model must belong to representations of the Poincare group. The\nmetrics compatible to the lorentzian complex structure are induced by a Kaehler\nmetric and the spacetime is a totally real lagrangian submanifold of a Kaehler\nmanifold. This opens up the possibility to use the geometric quantization\ndirectly to the solitonic surfaces of the model, considering their\ncorresponding Kaehler symplectic manifold as their phase space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Feb 2013 17:24:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-05"}

Recently, the structural characterization\nof the networks in which social interactions take place has shed some light on\nthe mechanisms by which cooperative behavior emerges and eventually overcomes\nthe natural temptation to defect. In particular, it has been found that the\nheterogeneity in the number of social ties and the presence of tightly knit\ncommunities lead to a significant increase in cooperation as compared with the\nunstructured and homogeneous connection patterns considered in classical\nevolutionary dynamics. Here, we investigate the role of social-ties dynamics\nfor the emergence of cooperation in a family of social dilemmas.

The new theorems show\nthat compressed sensing is also possible, and reveals several advantages, under\nthese substantially relaxed conditions. The importance of this is threefold.\nFirst, inverse problems to which compressed sensing is currently applied are\ntypically coherent. The new theory provides the first comprehensive\nmathematical explanation for a range of empirical usages of compressed sensing\nin real-world applications, such as medical imaging, microscopy, spectroscopy\nand others. Second, in showing that compressed sensing does not require\nincoherence, but instead that asymptotic incoherence is sufficient, the new\ntheory offers markedly greater flexibility in the design of sensing mechanisms.\nThird, by using asymptotic incoherence and multi-level sampling to exploit not\njust sparsity, but also structure, i.e. asymptotic sparsity, the new theory\nshows that substantially improved reconstructions can be obtained from fewer\nmeasurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Feb 2013 01:07:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Jan 2014 20:59:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 3 Feb 2014 02:53:40 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 23 Jun 2014 11:15:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-24"}

This model considers spherical\nparticles moving over an inclined flat surface based on three forces: gravity\nas the driving force, repulsive force due to particle collision, and drag force\nas the particle-- interaction through the ambient fluid. Numerical simulations\nof this model are conducted in two different types of two-dimensional planes,\ni.e., the monolayer was treated. In the horizontal plane parallel to the slope,\nparticles aggregate at the moving front of the granular flow; and subsequently,\nflow instability occurs as a wavy pattern. This flow pattern is caused by the\ninterparticle interaction arising from the drag force. Additionally, a vortex\nconvection of particles is formed inside the aggregations. Meanwhile, in the\nvertical plane on the slope, particle aggregation is also found at the moving\nfront of the granular flow. The aggregation resembles a head--tail structure,\nwhere the frontal angle against the slope approaches 60 degree from a larger\nangle as time progresses. Comparing the numerical result by varying the\nparticle size, the qualitative dynamics of the granular flow are independent of\nsize. To elucidate this reason, we perform a nondimensionalization for this\nmodel.

We combine these new thermal IR data\nwith existing 1-4um and 24um photometry to constrain the properties of the BDs\nand identify evidence for circumprimary/secondary disks in these unusual\nsystems. We confirm that GSC 06214B is surrounded by a disk, further showing\nthis disk produces a broadband IR excess due to small dust near the dust\nsublimation radius. An unresolved 24um excess in the system may be explained by\nthe contribution from this disk. 1RXS 1609B exhibits no 3-4um excess, nor does\nits primary; however, the system as a whole has a modest 24um excess, which may\ncome from warm dust around the primary and/or BD. Neither object in the HIP\n78530 system exhibits near- to mid-IR excesses. We additionally find that the\n1-4um colors of HIP 78530B match a spectral type of M3+-2, inconsistent with\nthe M8 spectral type assigned based on its near-IR spectrum, indicating it may\nbe a low-mass star rather than a BD. We present new upper limits on additional\nlow-mass companions in the system (<5M_Jup beyond 175AU). Finally, we examine\nthe utility of circumsecondary disks as probes of the formation histories of\nwide BD companions, finding that the presence of a disk may disfavor BD\nformation near the primary with subsequent outward scattering.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Feb 2013 04:57:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

In fact, this {\\it ad hoc} procedure\ngives results which depend on the choice of the renormalization scheme, and it\nis in conflict with the standard scale-setting procedure used in QED.\nPredictions for physical results should be independent of the choice of scheme\nor other theoretical conventions.

The RG equation\nprovides a convenient way for estimating the scheme- and scale- dependence of a\nphysical process.

Recently, warm dark matter (WDM) remarkably rose as an\nalternative of cold dark matter (CDM). In the literature, many attempts have\nbeen made to determine the equation-of-state parameter (EoS) of WDM. However,\nin most of the previous works, it is usually assumed that the EoS of dark\nmatter (DM) is constant (and usually the EoS of dark energy is also constant).\nObviously, this assumption is fairly restrictive. It is more natural to assume\na variable EoS for WDM (and dark energy). In the present work, we try to\nconstrain the EoS of variable WDM with the current cosmological observations.\nWe find that the best fits indicate WDM, while CDM is still consistent with the\ncurrent observational data. However, $\\Lambda$CDM is still better than WDM\nmodels from the viewpoint of goodness-of-fit. So, in order to distinguish WDM\nand CDM, the further observations on the small/galactic scale are required. On\nthe other hand, in this work we also consider WDM whose EoS is constant, while\nthe role of dark energy is played by various models. We find that the\ncosmological constraint on the constant EoS of WDM is fairly robust.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Feb 2013 11:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 Feb 2013 00:30:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 10 Mar 2013 10:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-12"}

It is shown that the temperature stratified\nturbulence strongly increases the degree of compressibility of particle\nvelocity field. This results in the strong decrease of the threshold for the\nexcitation of the tangling clustering instability even for small particles. The\ntangling clustering instability in the temperature stratified turbulence is\nessentially different from the inertial clustering instability that occurs in\nnon-stratified isotropic and homogeneous turbulence. While the inertial\nclustering instability is caused by the centrifugal effect of the turbulent\neddies, the mechanism of the tangling clustering instability is related to the\ntemperature fluctuations generated by the tangling of the mean temperature\ngradient by the velocity fluctuations. Temperature fluctuations produce\npressure fluctuations and cause particle clustering in regions with increased\npressure fluctuations. It is shown that the growth rate of the tangling\nclustering instability is much larger than that of the inertial clustering\ninstability. It is found that depending on the parameters of the turbulence and\nthe mean temperature gradient there is a preferential particle size at which\nthe particle clustering due to the tangling clustering instability is more\neffective. The particle number density inside the cluster after the saturation\nof this instability can be in several orders of magnitude larger than the mean\nparticle number density. It is also demonstrated that the evaporation of\ndroplets drastically change the tangling clustering instability, e.g., it\nincreases the instability threshold in the droplet radius.

A first type of user\nfollows a small number of other users. A second type of user follows\napproximately the same number of other users as the number of follows that the\nuser receives. Then, we compare local (i.e., egocentric) followership networks\naround the two types of users with many followers. We show that the second\ntype, which is presumably uninfluential users despite its large number of\nfollowers, is characterized by high link reciprocity, a large number of friends\n(i.e., those whom a user follows) for the followers, followers' high link\nreciprocity, large clustering coefficient, large fraction of the second type of\nusers among the followers, and a small PageRank.

Glycine (NH2CH2COOH), the\nsimplest amino acid, and related molecules such as glycinal, propionic acid and\npropanal, are included in the chemical network. Glycine is found to form in\nmoderate abundance within and upon dust-grain ices via three radical-addition\nmechanisms, with no single mechanism strongly dominant. Glycine production in\nthe ice occurs over temperatures ~40-120 K. Peak gas-phase glycine fractional\nabundances lie in the range 8 x 10^{-11} - 8 x 10^{-9}, occuring at ~200 K, the\nevaporation temperature of glycine. A gas-phase mechanism for glycine\nproduction is tested and found insignificant, even under optimal conditions. A\nnew spectroscopic radiative-transfer model is used, allowing the translation\nand comparison of the chemical-model results with observations of specific\nsources. Comparison with the nearby hot-core source NGC 6334 IRS1 shows\nexcellent agreement with integrated line intensities of observed species,\nincluding methyl formate. The results for glycine are consistent with the\ncurrent lack of a detection of this molecule toward other sources; the high\nevaporation temperature of glycine renders the emission region extremely\ncompact. Glycine detection with ALMA is predicted to be highly plausible, for\nbright, nearby sources with narrow emission lines.

Our\nproposed algorithms are novel in addressing a trade-off between active sensing\nperformance and time efficiency.

A prime zero-dimensional\nparadigm is predator-prey or Lotka-Volterra. Here we extend a successful\nthree-variable (temperature gradient; microturbulence level; one class of\ncoherent structure) model in this genre [M A Malkov and P H Diamond, Phys.\nPlasmas 16, 012504 (2009)], by adding a fourth variable representing a second\nclass of coherent structure.

The viscosity in the fluid depends on the temperature as it\nchanges its value abruptly in an interval around a temperature of transition.\nThe influence of the viscosity law on the morphology of the plumes is examined\nfor several parameter settings, and a variety of shapes ranging from spout to\nmushroom shaped is found. We explore the impact of the symmetry on the time\nevolution of this type of fluid, and find solutions which are greatly\ninfluenced by its presence: at a large aspect ratio and high Rayleigh numbers,\ntraveling waves, heteroclinic connections and chaotic regimes are found. These\nsolutions, which are due to the symmetry presence, have not been previously\ndescribed in the context of temperature dependent viscosities. However,\nsimilarities are found with solutions described in other contexts such as flame\npropagation problems or convection problems with constant viscosity also under\nthe presence of the O(2) symmetry, thus confirming the determining role of the\nsymmetry in the dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Feb 2013 15:58:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 2 Nov 2013 18:42:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-05"}

We formulate the dynamical as well as\ntransport equations and then couple them to investigate the process of\ncollapse. We conclude that the gravitational force in this theory is much\nstronger as compared to general relativity which indicates increase in the rate\nof collapse. Further, the relation between the Weyl tensor and matter\ncomponents is established. This shows that for constant f(G) the vanishing of\nthe Weyl scalar leads to the homogeneity in energy density and vice versa.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Feb 2013 08:32:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}
