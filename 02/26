For those targets with good uv coverage, we used a\nfour parameter Gaussian elliptical disk model to fit the visibilities and to\ndetermine the axial ratio, position angle, K-band photospheric flux\ncontribution, and angular diameter of the disk major axis. For the other\ntargets with relatively limited uv coverage, we constrained the axial ratio,\ninclination angle, and or disk position angle where necessary in order to\nresolve the degeneracy between possible model solutions. We also made fits of\nthe ultraviolet and infrared spectral energy distributions to estimate the\nstellar angular diameter and infrared flux excess of each target. The mean\nratio of the disk diameter (measured in K-band emission) to stellar diameter\n(from SED modeling) is 4.4 among the 14 cases where we reliably resolved the\ndisk emission, a value which is generally lower than the disk size ratio\nmeasured in the higher opacity Halpha emission line.

An analogous analysis reveals that both random mass and random\ngauge potential are irrelevant.

The conditions under\nwhich ULX form are poorly understood, but recent evidence suggests they may be\nmore common in low metallicity systems. Here we investigate the hypothesis that\nULX form preferentially in low metallicity galaxies by searching for ULX in a\nsample of Extremely Metal Poor Galaxies (XMPG) observed with the Chandra X-ray\nObservatory. XMPG are defined as galaxies with log(O/H)+12<7.65, or less than\n5% solar. These are the most metal-deficient galaxies known, and a logical\nplace to find ULX if they favor metal poor systems. We compare the number of\nULX (corrected for background contamination) per unit of star formation (Nulx)\nin the XMPG sample with Nulx in a comparison sample of galaxies with higher\nmetallicities taken from the Spitzer Infrared Galaxy Sample (SINGS). We find\nthat ULX occur preferentially in the metal poor sample with a formal\nstatistical significance of 2.3 sigma.

Our goal is to determine the physical processes responsible for the\nincrease in the central gas-phase metallicity and of the central SFR observed\nin SDSS. We define a 2kpc diameter central aperture to approximate the\nintegrated spectroscopic fibre measurements from the SDSS. The chemical\nevolution observed within this central region depends critically upon the\nrelative size of the bar and the aperture, which evolves strongly with time. At\nt~0.5Gyr, a strong bar forms, whose length is considerably longer than the 2kpc\naperture. The stars and gas lose angular momentum and follow elongated orbits\nthat cause an intense mixing of the gas between the central region and its\nsurroundings. During the next 1.5Gyr, the orbits of the gas contract\nsignificantly until the entire gas bar is contained in the 2kpc aperture,\nresulting in a net flux of gas into the central region. During this period, the\nmetallicity in the central region increases steadily, and this enrichment is\ndominated by metal-rich gas that is flowing into the central region. The main\nresult of this work is therefore that the observed enrichment in the centres of\nbarred galaxies is not dominated by in-situ enrichment by stars formed in the\ncentre. Rather, star formation occurs along the full length of the bar, much of\nwhich occurs initially outside the 2kpc aperture. About 50% of the metals that\nend up in the central region originate from this extended bar-long star\nformation, but flow into the central region due to loss of angular momentum. We\nconclude that there is no direct connection between central SFR and central\nmetallicity. The central metallicity does not originate exclusively from\ncentral stars. Instead, the global SFR (especially along the bar) and the\nlarge-scale flow of enriched gas play a major role.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Feb 2013 20:10:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

Our primary result is that X-ray radiation from the\nshocks inhibits wind acceleration and can lead to a lower pre-shock velocity,\nand a correspondingly lower shocked plasma temperature, yet the intrinsic X-ray\nluminosity of the shocks, LX remains largely unaltered, with the exception of a\nmodest increase at small binary separations.

Several commonly employed size\nmeasurement techniques are used, including single Sersic fits, two-component\nSersic models, and a non-parametric method. Through simple simulations, we show\nthat the non-parametric and two-component Sersic methods provide the most\nrobust effective radius measurements, while those based on single Sersic\nprofiles are often overestimates, especially for massive red/early-type\ngalaxies. Using our robust sizes, we show for all sub-samples that the\nmass-size relations are shallow at low stellar masses and steepen above ~ 3-4 x\n10^{10}\\msun. The mass-size relations for galaxies classified as late-type,\nlow-n, and star-forming are consistent with each other, while blue galaxies\nfollow a somewhat steeper relation. The mass-size relations of early-type,\nhigh-n, red, and quiescent galaxies all agree with each other but are somewhat\nsteeper at the high-mass end than previous results. To test potential\nsystematics at high redshift, we artificially redshifted our sample (including\nsurface brightness dimming and degraded resolution) to z=1 and re-fit the\ngalaxies using single Serisc profiles. The sizes of these galaxies before and\nafter redshifting are consistent and we conclude that systematic effects in\nsizes and the size-mass relation at z ~ 1 are negligible. Interestingly, since\nthe poorer physical resolution at high redshift washes out bright galaxy\nsubstructures, single-Sersic fitting appears to provide more reliable and\nunbiased effective radius measurements at high z than for nearby, well-resolved\ngalaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Feb 2013 21:00:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Oct 2013 12:47:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

This limit is given by the balance\nbetween the accelerating electric force and the radiation reaction force acting\non the electrons. The discovery of synchrotron gamma-ray flares in the Crab\nNebula, well above this limit, challenges this classical picture of particle\nacceleration. To overcome this limit, particles must accelerate in a region of\nhigh electric field and low magnetic field. This is possible only with a\nnon-ideal magnetohydrodynamic process, like magnetic reconnection. We present\nthe first numerical evidence of particle acceleration beyond the synchrotron\nburnoff limit, using a set of 2D particle-in-cell simulations of\nultra-relativistic pair plasma reconnection. We use a new code, Zeltron, that\nincludes self-consistently the radiation reaction force in the equation of\nmotion of the particles. We demonstrate that the most energetic particles move\nback and forth across the reconnection layer, following relativistic Speiser\norbits. These particles then radiate >160 MeV synchrotron radiation rapidly,\nwithin a fraction of a full gyration, after they exit the layer. Our analysis\nshows that the high-energy synchrotron flux is highly variable in time because\nof the strong anisotropy and inhomogeneity of the energetic particles. We\ndiscover a robust positive correlation between the flux and the cut-off energy\nof the emitted radiation, mimicking the effect of relativistic Doppler\namplification. A strong guide field quenches the emission of >160 MeV\nsynchrotron radiation.

The bottom line is that upon expanding in powers of 1/L the energy\nlevels of long (closed) strings (where L is the length of the string), all the\nterms up to (and including) order 1/L^5 are universal.

By a stable\nsystem, we broadly mean that small disturbances either in the system inputs or\nin the initial conditions do not lead to large changes in the overall behavior\nof the system. To be of practical use, a system must have to be stable. The\ntheory of stability is a vast, rapidly growing subject with prolific and\ninnovative contributions from numerous researchers. As such, an introductory\nbook that covers the basic concepts and minute details about this theory is\nessential. The primary aim of this book is to make the readers familiar with\nthe various terminologies and methods related to the stability analysis of\ntime-invariant (autonomous) and time-varying (non-autonomous) systems. A\nspecial treatment is given to the celebrated Liapunov's direct method which is\nso far the most widely used and perhaps the best method for determining the\nstability nature of both autonomous as well as non-autonomous systems. After\ndiscussing autonomous systems to a considerable extent, the book concentrates\non the non-autonomous systems. From stability point of view, these systems are\noften quite difficult to manage. Also, unlike their autonomous counterparts,\nthe non-autonomous systems often behave in peculiar manners which can make the\nanalysts arrive at misleading conclusions. Due to these issues, this book\nattempts to present a careful and systematic study about the stability\nproperties of non-autonomous systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Feb 2013 21:36:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-27"}

These anomalies may be associated with a hypothetical\nliquid-liquid critical point in supercooled water below the line of homogeneous\nnucleation. However, while the thermal conductivity is known to diverge at the\nvapor-liquid critical point due to critical density fluctuations, the thermal\nconductivity of supercooled water, calculated as the product of thermal\ndiffusivity and heat capacity, does not show any sign of such an anomaly. We\nhave used mode-coupling theory to investigate the possible effect of critical\nfluctuations on the thermal conductivity of supercooled water, and found that\nindeed any critical thermal-conductivity enhancement would be too small to be\nmeasurable at experimentally accessible temperatures.

In this paper, turbo-coded orthogonal multi-tone\nfrequency-shift keying (FSK) is considered for the two-way relay channel. In\ncontrast with analog network coding, the system considered is an instance of\ndigital network coding; i.e., the relay decodes the network codeword and\nforwards a re-encoded version.

We investigated whether\nphylogenetic uncertainty affects a commonly used method (MEDUSA, modelling\nevolutionary diversity using stepwise AIC) for estimating shifts in\ndiversification rates in lineages of the family Nymphalidae, by extending the\nmethod to run across a random sample of phylogenetic trees from the posterior\ndistribution of a Bayesian run. We found that phylogenetic uncertainty greatly\naffects diversification rate estimates. Different trees from the posterior\ndistribution can give diversification rates ranging from high values to almost\nzero for the same clade, and for some clades both significant rate increase and\ndecrease were estimated. Only three out of 13 significant shifts found on the\nmaximum credibility tree were consistent across more than 95% of the trees from\nthe posterior: (i) accelerated diversification for Solanaceae feeders in the\ntribe Ithomiini; (ii) accelerated diversification in the genus Charaxes, and\n(iii) deceleration in the Danaina.

A shift to Apocynaceae is not responsible for the slowdown of\ndiversification in Danaina.

We suggest that the quasi-periodicity feature of\ntiming noise, with rapid oscillations lying on lower frequency structure, comes\nfrom the geodetic precession of an unseen binary system, which induces\nadditional motion of the pulsar spin axis. The resultant change of azimuth and\nlatitude at which the observer's line of sight crosses the emission beam is\nresponsible for the variation of timing noise and pulse profile respectively.\nThe first numerical simulation to both timing noise and pulse profile variation\nare thus performed, from which the orbital periods of these pulsars are of 1-35\nminutes.

Thus,\nunderstanding the structures and evolutions of reciprocal edges and parasocial\nones, exploring the factors that influence parasocial edges to become\nreciprocal ones, and predicting whether a parasocial edge will turn into a\nreciprocal one are basic research problems.\n  However, there have been few systematic studies about such problems. In this\npaper, we bridge this gap using a novel large-scale Google+ dataset crawled by\nourselves as well as one publicly available social network dataset. First, we\ncompare the structures and evolutions of reciprocal edges and those of\nparasocial edges. For instance, we find that reciprocal edges are more likely\nto connect users with similar degrees while parasocial edges are more likely to\nlink ordinary users (e.g., users with low degrees) and popular users (e.g.,\ncelebrities). However, the impacts of reciprocal edges linking ordinary and\npopular users on the network structures increase slowly as the social networks\nevolve.

Third, in contrast to previous studies that treat\nreciprocal edge prediction as either a supervised or a semi-supervised learning\nproblem, we identify that reciprocal edge prediction is better modeled as an\noutlier detection problem.

To date, very little\nresearch has been done to develop the theory and practice of cloud forensics.\nMany factors complicate forensic investigations in a cloud environment. First,\nthe storage system is no longer local. Therefore, even with a subpoena, law\nenforcement agents cannot confiscate the suspect's computer and get access to\nthe suspect's files. Second, each cloud server contains files from many users.\nHence, it is not feasible to seize servers from a data center without violating\nthe privacy of many other users.

This sheds new light on several observations of Solar System objects:\n(i) the similar N isotopic fractionation in Jupiter's NH3 and solar wind N+;\n(ii) the 15N-enrichments in cometary HCN and CN (that might represent a direct\ninter- stellar inheritance); and (iii) 15N-enrichments observed in organics in\nprimitive cosmomaterials. The large variations in the isotopic composition of\nN-bearing molecules in Solar System objects might then simply reflect the\ndifferent interstellar N reservoirs from which they are originating.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Feb 2013 05:35:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

Furthermore, we open up the possibility to pull back\nproperties from first-order term graphs to lambda-ho-term-graphs, properties\nsuch as the complete lattice structure of bisimulation equivalence classes with\nrespect to the sharing order.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Feb 2013 06:50:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-27"}

Relationship quality (RQ) is replacing service quality as a key\nsource of superior performance and competitive advantage. Accordingly, this\nstudy investigates the dimensions of relationship quality from e-Banking\nservices and explores the differences among customers of Jordanian and foreign\nbanks. Many of the foreign banks in Jordan are equipped with large financial\ncapital, having high banking and financial experiences and are offering many\nmodern hi-tech banking services. This situation makes Jordanian banks in front\nof unprecedented competition and so they have invested heavily to develop their\ne-banking services, in order to strengthening their relationships with existing\ncustomers, enhancing their trust, letting them satisfied, ensuring their\ncommitment and attracting of new ones. This paper aims to identify the key\ndimensions that shape the relationship quality among Jordanian and foreign\nbanks and their customers who are utilizing the e-Banking services. Based on an\nextensive review of relevant literature, we have formulated nine hypotheses and\nidentified three factors (satisfaction, trust, and commitment) that may affect\nthe competitiveness and success of Jordanian and foreign banks. Survey data\nfrom 350 customers from four Jordanian banks and four foreign banks in Amman\ncity the capital of Jordan were collected and used to test the proposed\nhypotheses.

We show that in DVG the vecton field can be consistently\nreplaced by an effectively massive scalar field (scalaron) with an unusual\ncoupling to dilaton gravity. With this vecton - scalaron duality, one can use\nmethods and results of the standard DG coupled to usual scalars (DGS) in more\ncomplex dilaton - scalaron gravity theories (DSG) equivalent to DVG.

It exhibits the\nphysical mechanism underlying shape perception for weakly electric fish. These\nfish orient themselves at night in complete darkness by employing their active\nelectrolocation system. They generate a stable, high-frequency, weak electric\nfield and perceive the transdermal potential modulations caused by a nearby\ntarget with different admittivity than the surrounding water. In this paper, we\nexplain how weakly electric fish might identify and classify a target, knowing\nby advance that the latter belongs to a certain collection of shapes. Our model\nof the weakly electric fish relies on differential imaging, i.e., by forming an\nimage from the perturbations of the field due to targets, and physics-based\nclassification. The electric fish would first locate the target using a\nspecific location search algorithm. Then it could extract, from the\nperturbations of the electric field, generalized (or high-order) polarization\ntensors of the target. Computing, from the extracted features, invariants under\nrigid motions and scaling yields shape descriptors. The weakly electric fish\nmight classify a target by comparing its invariants with those of a set of\nlearned shapes. On the other hand, when measurements are taken at multiple\nfrequencies, the fish might exploit the shifts and use the spectral content of\nthe generalized polarization tensors to dramatically improve the stability with\nrespect to measurement noise of the classification procedure in\nelectro-sensing. Surprisingly, it turns out that the first-order polarization\ntensor at multiple frequencies could be enough for the purpose of\nclassification. A procedure to eliminate the background field in the case where\nthe permittivity of the surrounding medium can be neglected, and hence improve\nfurther the stability of the classification process, is also discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Feb 2013 10:25:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

We\nanalyze the robustness of these entangled molecular states with respect to\nintensity fluctuations of the trapping laser and discuss possible applications\nof the system for quantum information processing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Feb 2013 14:26:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-27"}

G29.96-0.02 is a high-mass star-forming cloud observed at 70, 160,\n250, 350, and 500 microns as part of the Herschel survey of the Galactic Plane\nduring the Science Demonstration Phase. Aims. We wish to conduct a far-infrared\nstudy of the sources associated with this star-forming region by estimating\ntheir physical properties and evolutionary stage, and investigating the clump\nmass function, the star formation efficiency and rate in the cloud. Methods. We\nhave identified the Hi-GAL sources associated with the cloud, searched for\npossible counterparts at centimeter and infrared wavelengths, fitted their\nspectral energy distribution and estimated their physical parameters. Results.\nA total of 198 sources have been detected in all 5 Hi-GAL bands, 117 of which\nare associated with 24 microns emission and 87 of which are not associated with\n24 microns emission. We called the former sources 24 microns-bright and the\nlatter ones 24 microns-dark. The [70-160] color of the 24 microns-dark sources\nis smaller than that of the 24 microns-bright ones. The 24 microns-dark sources\nhave lower L_bol and L_bol/M_env than the 24 microns-bright ones for similar\nM_env, which suggests that they are in an earlier evolutionary phase. The\nG29-SFR cloud is associated with 10 NVSS sources and with extended centimeter\ncontinuum emission well correlated with the 70 microns emission. Most of the\nNVSS sources appear to be early B or late O-type stars. The most massive and\nluminous Hi-GAL sources in the cloud are located close to the G29-UC region,\nwhich suggests that there is a privileged area for massive star formation\ntowards the center of the G29-SFR cloud. Almost all the Hi-GAL sources have\nmasses well above the Jeans mass but only 5% have masses above the virial mass,\nwhich indicates that most of the sources are stable against gravitational\ncollapse.

First, an analytic model is developed through the\nuse of the ballooning transform. The terms that generate the momentum transport\nare then connected with the poloidal derivative of the ballooning envelope,\nwhich are one order smaller in the normalised Larmor radius, compared with the\nderivative of the eikonal. The mechanism, therefore, does not introduce an\ninhomogeneity in the radial direction, in contrast with the effect of profile\nshearing. Numerical simulations of the linear ion temperature gradient mode\nwith adiabatic electrons, retaining the finite rho* effects in the ExB\nvelocity, the drift, and the gyro-average, are presented. The momentum flux is\nfound to be linear in the normalised Larmor radius (\\rho*) but is,\nnevertheless, generating a sizeable counter-current rotation. The total\nmomentum flux scales linear with the aspect ratio of the considered magnetic\nsurface, and increases with increasing magnetic shear, safety factor, and\ndensity and temperature gradients.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Feb 2013 15:17:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-22"}

However, the lack of rapid rotators in the\nmagnetic white dwarf population has been always considered a problematic issue\nof this scenario. Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics simulations show that in\nmergers in which the two white dwarfs have different masses a disc around the\ncentral compact object is formed. If the central object is magnetized it can\ninteract with the disc through its magnetosphere. The torque applied by the\ndisc changes the spin of the star, whereas the transferred angular momentum\nfrom the star to the disc determines the properties of the disc. In this work\nwe build a model for the disc evolution under the effect of magnetic accretion,\nand for the angular momentum evolution of the star, which can be compared with\nthe observations. Our model predicts that the magnetospheric interaction of\nmagnetic white dwarfs with their discs results in a significant spin down, and\nwe show that for magnetic white dwarfs with relatively strong fields (larger\nthan 10 MG) the observed rotation periods of the magnetic white dwarf\npopulation can be reproduced.

Correspondingly, a number of algorithms have been developed that\nexploit Toeplitz structure to gain computational efficiency when solving these\nsystems. The earliest \"fast\" algorithms for Toeplitz systems required O(n^2)\noperations, while more recent \"superfast\" algorithms reduce the cost to O(n\n(log n)^2) or below. In this work, we present a superfast algorithm for\nTikhonov regularization of Toeplitz systems. Using an\n\"extension-and-transformation\" technique, our algorithm translates a\nTikhonov-regularized Toeplitz system into a type of specialized polynomial\nproblem known as tangential interpolation. Under this formulation, we can\ncompute the solution in only O(n (log n)^2) operations. We use numerical\nsimulations to demonstrate our algorithm's complexity and verify that it\nreturns stable solutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Feb 2013 22:49:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 Feb 2013 01:23:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

In particular, TABG can\ncheck that all the subterms reaching a given state are distinct. This\nconstraint is related to monadic key constraints for XML documents, meaning\nthat every two distinct positions of a given type have different values. We\nprove decidability of the emptiness problem for TABG. This solves, in\nparticular, the open question of the decidability of emptiness for TAGED. We\nfurther extend our result by allowing global arithmetic constraints for\ncounting the number of occurrences of some state or the number of different\nequivalence classes of subterms (modulo a given flat equational theory)\nreaching some state during a computation. We also adapt the model to unranked\nordered terms. As a consequence of our results for TABG, we prove the\ndecidability of a fragment of the monadic second order logic on trees extended\nwith predicates for equality and disequality between subtrees, and cardinality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Feb 2013 12:52:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Apr 2013 09:29:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-01"}
