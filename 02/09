We relax this assumption to prove that AIC itself is\nasymptotically efficient and we study its performance in finite samples. In\nclassical regression, it is known that AIC tends to select overly complex\nmodels when the dimension of the maximum candidate model is large relative to\nthe sample size. Simulation studies suggest that AIC suffers from the same\nshortcomings when used in penalized regression. We therefore propose the use of\nthe classical corrected AIC (AICc) as an alternative and prove that it\nmaintains the desired asymptotic properties. To broaden our results, we further\nprove the efficiency of AIC for penalized likelihood methods in the context of\ngeneralized linear models with no dispersion parameter. Similar results exist\nin the literature but only for a restricted set of candidate models. By\nemploying results from the classical literature on maximum-likelihood\nestimation in misspecified models, we are able to establish this result for a\ngeneral set of candidate models. We use simulations to assess the performance\nof AIC and AICc, as well as that of other selectors, in finite samples for both\nSCAD-penalized and Lasso regressions and a real data example is considered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Feb 2013 16:02:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-02"}

We show that the most dramatic and easily observable consequence\nof the anomalous C/O abundance, is the significant, by more than an order of\nmagnitude, attenuation of the Ka line of iron. It is caused by screening of the\npresence of iron by oxygen - in the C/O dominated material the main interaction\nprocess for a E ~ 7keV photon is absorption by oxygen rather than by iron,\ncontrary to the solar composition case. Ionization of oxygen at high mass\naccretion rates adds a luminosity dependence to this behavior - the iron line\nis significantly suppressed only at low luminosity, log(LX) less than 37-37.5,\nand should recover its nominal strength at higher luminosity. The increase of\nthe EW of the Ka lines of carbon and oxygen, on the other hand, saturates at\nrather moderate values. Screening by He is less important, due to its low\nionization threshold and because in the accretion disk it is mostly ionized.\nConsequently, in the case of the He-rich donor, the iron line strength remains\nclose to its nominal value, determined by the iron abundance in the accretion\ndisk. This opens the possibility of constraining the nature of donor stars in\nUCXBs by means of X-ray spectroscopy with moderate energy resolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Feb 2013 16:05:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 Apr 2013 13:31:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

The regular momentum conservation phenomenon can be\nviewed as the limit of the damping-induced self-recovery phenomenon in the\nsense that the self-recovery phenomenon disappears as the damping goes to zero.\nThis paper generalizes the past result on damping-induced self-recovery for the\ncase of a single unactuated cyclic variable to the case of multiple unactuated\ncyclic variables. We characterize a class of external forces that induce new\nconserved quantities, which we call the damping-induced momenta. The\ndamping-induced momenta yield first-order asymptotically stable dynamics for\nthe unactuated cyclic variables under some conditions, thereby inducing the\nself-recovery phenomenon. It is also shown that the viscous damping-like forces\nimpose bounds on the range of trajectories of the unactuated cyclic variables.\nTwo examples are presented to demonstrate the analytical discoveries: the\nplanar pendulum with gimbal actuators and the three-link planar manipulator on\na horizontal plane.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Feb 2013 18:49:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-03"}

Analogously to the information-theoretic\ncase, one might expect that also for the \\emph{computational} variants of\nentropy the loss depends only on the actual leakage, i.e. on $Z_{\\ell+1}$.\nSurprisingly, Krenn et al.\\ have shown recently that for the most commonly used\ndefinitions of computational entropy this holds only if the computational\nquality of the entropy deteriorates exponentially in\n$|(Z_{1},\\ldots,Z_{\\ell})|$. This means that the current standard definitions\nof computational entropy do not allow to fully capture leakage that occurred\n\"in the past\", which severely limits the applicability of this notion.\n  As a remedy for this problem we propose a slightly stronger definition of the\ncomputational entropy, which we call the \\emph{modulus computational entropy},\nand use it as a technical tool that allows us to prove a desired chain rule\nthat depends only on the actual leakage and not on its history. Moreover, we\nshow that the modulus computational entropy unifies other,sometimes seemingly\nunrelated, notions already studied in the literature in the context of\ninformation leakage and chain rules. Our results indicate that the modulus\nentropy is, up to now, the weakest restriction that guarantees that the chain\nrule for the computational entropy works. As an example of application we\ndemonstrate a few interesting cases where our restricted definition is\nfulfilled and the chain rule holds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Feb 2013 19:43:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 May 2013 16:59:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 25 Nov 2013 16:43:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-26"}

In over hundred years of turbulence modeling, the numerical\nschemes adopted to simulate turbulent flow - with the exception of the Lattice\nBoltzmann methods - have never exploited this analogy in any other way. In this\nwork, a gas-kinetic scheme is modified to simulate turbulent flow; the\nturbulent relaxation time is deduced from assumed turbulent quantities.

When our model is applied to\nKepler planet candidate KIC 12557548b --- which is believed to be a rocky body\nevaporating at a rate of dM/dt > 0.1 M_Earth/Gyr --- our model yields a\npresent-day planet mass of < 0.02 M_Earth or less than about twice the mass of\nthe Moon. Mass loss rates depend so strongly on planet mass that bodies can\nreside on close-in orbits for Gyrs with initial masses comparable to or less\nthan that of Mercury, before entering a final short-lived phase of catastrophic\nmass loss (which KIC 12557548b has entered). Because this catastrophic stage\nlasts only up to a few percent of the planet's life, we estimate that for every\nobject like KIC 12557548b, there should be 10--100 close-in quiescent\nprogenitors with sub-day periods whose hard-surface transits may be detectable\nby Kepler --- if the progenitors are as large as their maximal, Mercury-like\nsizes (alternatively, the progenitors could be smaller and more numerous).\nAccording to our calculations, KIC 12557548b may have lost ~70% of its\nformation mass; today we may be observing its naked iron core.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Feb 2013 21:00:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 11 Apr 2013 05:36:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 21 May 2013 04:51:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

Though very popular and robust, this conjecture still needs a\nconclusive proof. The strongest support to this idea is probably the fact that\nsupernova remnants are observed in gamma-rays, which are indeed expected as the\nresult of the hadronic interactions between the cosmic rays accelerated at the\nshock and the ambient gas. However, also leptonic processes can, in most cases,\nexplain the observed gamma-ray emission. This implies that the detections in\ngamma rays do not necessarily mean that supernova remnants accelerate cosmic\nray protons. To overcome this degeneracy, the multi-wavelength emission (from\nradio to gamma rays) from individual supernova remnants has been studied and in\na few cases it has been possible to ascribe the gamma-ray emission to one of\nthe two processes (hadronic or leptonic). Here we adopt a different approach\nand, instead of a case-by-case study we aim for a population study and we\ncompute the number of supernova remnants which are expected to be seen in TeV\ngamma rays above a given flux under the assumption that these objects indeed\nare the sources of cosmic rays. The predictions found here match well with\ncurrent observational results, thus providing a novel consistency check for the\nsupernova remnant paradigm for the origin of galactic cosmic rays. Moreover,\nhints are presented for the fact that particle spectra significantly steeper\nthan E^-2 are produced at supernova remnants. Finally, we expect that several\nof the supernova remnants detected by H.E.S.S. in the survey of the galactic\nplane should exhibit a gamma-ray emission dominated by hadronic processes (i.e.\nneutral pion decay). The fraction of the detected remnants for which the\nleptonic emission dominates over the hadronic one depends on the assumed values\nof the physical parameters and can be as high as roughly a half.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Feb 2013 21:00:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

The player\nstrives to minimize regret, the difference between his loss and the loss of a\npost-hoc benchmark strategy. The standard benchmark is the loss of the best\nstrategy chosen from a bounded comparator set. When the the comparison set and\nthe adversary's gradients satisfy L_infinity bounds, we give the value of the\ngame in closed form and prove it approaches sqrt(2T/pi) as T -> infinity.\n  Interesting algorithms result when we consider soft constraints on the\ncomparator, rather than restricting it to a bounded set. As a warmup, we\nanalyze the game with a quadratic penalty. The value of this game is exactly\nT/2, and this value is achieved by perhaps the simplest online algorithm of\nall: unprojected gradient descent with a constant learning rate.\n  We then derive a minimax-optimal algorithm for a much softer penalty\nfunction. This algorithm achieves good bounds under the standard notion of\nregret for any comparator point, without needing to specify the comparator set\nin advance. The value of this game converges to sqrt{e} as T ->infinity; we\ngive a closed-form for the exact value as a function of T.

These four frequencies are very close to\nthe four major heliospheric oscillations relative to the center of mass of the\nsolar system caused by Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune.

Speculation consists in\nguaranteeing that the system satisfies its requirements for any execution but\nexhibits significantly better performances for a subset of executions that are\nmore probable. A speculative protocol is in this sense supposed to be both\nrobust and efficient in practice. We introduce the notion of speculative\nstabilization which we illustrate through the mutual exclusion problem. We then\npresent a novel speculatively stabilizing mutual exclusion protocol. Our\nprotocol is self-stabilizing for any asynchronous execution. We prove that its\nstabilization time for synchronous executions is diam(g)/2 steps (where diam(g)\ndenotes the diameter of the system). This complexity result is of independent\ninterest. The celebrated mutual exclusion protocol of Dijkstra stabilizes in n\nsteps (where n is the number of processes) in synchronous executions and the\nquestion whether the stabilization time could be strictly smaller than the\ndiameter has been open since then (almost 40 years).

A CW semiconductor laser and a\nfemtosecond Ti:Sa laser were used to excite the plasmons and the SPO excited\ntunnel current was used as the detector. When scanning the STM from negative to\npositive bias and reversed, hysteresis in the tunnel signal was found,\nexcluding (or rather minimizing) the role of the presence of a Casimir effect\nin the process. It was found, however, that a multiple image charge induced\ndouble well potential may explain our experimental findings. The stepwise\nbehaviour of the area of the observed hysteresis loops is a new, additional\nindication of the non-classical properties of the SPOs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Feb 2013 15:02:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-27"}

We re-analyze the available photometric HST data, and we\ncompare them with the results of N-body/smoothed particle hydrodynamics\nsimulations. In particular, we derive synthetic surface brightness profiles for\nthe simulated counterpart of HLX-1 in six HST filters, ranging from far\nultraviolet (FUV) to infrared wavelengths. Such synthetic profiles include a\ncontribution from the stellar population associated with the simulated\ndisrupted satellite and a contribution from an irradiated disc model.

The main difference between models and\nobservations is in the FUV band, where the HST image shows a fuzzy and extended\nemission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Feb 2013 15:45:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-12"}
