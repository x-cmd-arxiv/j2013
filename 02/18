The most important factor contributing to\nthe distinction between different literary styles was {the average shortest\npath length (particularly, the asymmetry of the distribution)}. Furthermore,\nover time there has been a trend toward larger average shortest path lengths,\nwhich is correlated with increased syntactic complexity, and a more uniform use\nof the words reflected in a smaller power-law coefficient for the distribution\nof word frequency.

Many enzymes\nchange from an open to a closed conformation upon binding of substrate or\ninhibitor molecules. These conformational changes have been suggested to follow\nan induced-fit mechanism in which the molecules first bind in the open\nconformation in those cases where binding in the closed conformation appears to\nbe sterically obstructed such as for the HIV-1 protease. In this article, we\npresent a general model for the catalysis and inhibition of enzymes with\ninduced-fit binding mechanism. We derive general expressions that specify how\nthe overall catalytic rate of the enzymes depends on the rates for binding, for\nthe conformational changes, and for the chemical reaction. Based on these\nexpressions, we analyze the effect of mutations that mainly shift the\nconformational equilibrium on catalysis and inhibition. If the overall\ncatalytic rate is limited by product unbinding, we find that mutations that\ndestabilize the closed conformation relative to the open conformation increase\nthe catalytic rate in the presence of inhibitors by a factor exp(ddG/RT) where\nddG is the mutation-induced shift of the free-energy difference between the\nconformations. This increase in the catalytic rate due to changes in the\nconformational equilibrium is independent of the inhibitor molecule and, thus,\nmay help to understand how non-active-site mutations can contribute to the\nmulti-drug-resistance that has been observed for the HIV-1 protease. A\ncomparison to experimental data for the non-active-site mutation L90M of the\nHIV-1 protease indicates that the mutation slightly destabilizes the closed\nconformation of the enzyme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Feb 2013 19:41:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-19"}

The loans were part of a general government policy which used\nindexation to the CPI to address the economic consequences of the\nhyperinflation. Although most other forms of indexation were subsequently\nremoved, loan indexation has remained, and these loans now comprise the\nmajority of mortgages in Iceland. Although it is still often argued that\nindex-linked loans helped to stop the hyperinflation, these arguments are\ntypically based on high level macro-economic interpretations of the Icelandic\neconomy, they fail to identify specific mechanisms to support their claims. In\nthis paper we take the opposite approach, and present a detailed analysis of\nthe monetary mechanics used for the loans at the double entry bookkeeping level\nof the banking system.\n  Based on this analysis there appears to be no evidence or mechanism that\nwould support the claim that index-linked loans reduce or stop inflation. On\nthe contrary: our research shows that the bookkeeping treatment of these loans\nwithin the banking system directly contributes to the banking system's monetary\nexpansion rate, and hence index-linked loans act to increase the inflation rate\nto which they are linked, rather than reducing it. They consequently create a\npositive feedback loop within the banking system's monetary regulation\noperating directly on the money supply. Since the feedback into monetary\nexpansion only occurs at annual CPI rates above approximately 2%, we suggest\none solution would be to stabilise the money supply to 0% growth, and we\nexplore some ways this could be achieved by modifying the Basel Regulatory\nFramework within the Icelandic Banking System.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Feb 2013 19:43:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Apr 2014 01:08:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-09"}

The MAC scheduling problem in such\nnetworks refers to making intelligent decisions on which communication links to\nactivate at which time instant and over which frequency band. The challenge in\ndesigning a low-complexity distributed MAC, that achieves low delay, is posed\nby two additional dimensions of cognitive radio networks: interference graphs\nand data rates that are frequency-band dependent, and explosion in number of\nfeasible schedules due to large number of available frequency-bands.

Our proposed MAC also achieves\na throughput provably within a constant fraction (under isotropic propagation)\nof the maximum throughput. Due to a recent impossibility result, optimal\ndelay-scaling could only be achieved with some amount of throughput loss [30].\nExtensive simulations using OMNeT++ network simulator shows that, compared to a\nmulti-band extension of a state-of-art CSMA algorithm (namely, Q-CSMA), our\nasynchronous algorithm achieves a 2.5x? reduction in delay while achieving at\nleast 85% of the maximum achievable throughput.

The ALMA\nobservations were carried out in the extended array at 0.7\" resolution. We have\ndetected the line and dust continuum in all five objects. The derived [C II]\nline luminosities are 1.6x10^{9} to 8.8x10^{9} Lsun and the [C II]-to-FIR\nluminosity ratios are 3.0-5.6x10^{-4}, which is comparable to the values found\nin other high-redshift quasar-starburst systems and local ultra-luminous\ninfrared galaxies. The sources are marginally resolved and the intrinsic source\nsizes (major axis FWHM) are constrained to be 0.3\" to 0.6\" (i.e., 1.7 to 3.5\nkpc) for the [C II] line emission and 0.2\" to 0.4\" (i.e., 1.2 to 2.3 kpc) for\nthe continuum. These measurements indicate that there is vigorous star\nformation over the central few kpc in the quasar host galaxies.

Such velocity gradients are consistent with a\nrotating, gravitationally bound gas component, although they are not uniquely\ninterpreted as such. Under the simplifying assumption of rotation, the implied\ndynamical masses within the [C II]-emitting regions are of order 10^{10} to\n10^{11} Msun.

In this context, an efficient standalone method for rapid\nassignment of backbone (1H, 15N, 13Ca and 13C') resonances and secondary\nstructure determination of proteins has been presented here. Compared to\ncurrently available strategies used for the purpose, the method employs only a\nsingle reduced dimensionality (RD) experiment -(4,3)D-hnCOCANH and exploits the\nlinear combinations of backbone (13Ca and 13C') chemical shifts to achieve a\ndispersion relatively better compared to those of individual chemical shifts\n(see the text) for efficient and rapid data analysis. Further, the experiment\nleads to the spectrum with direct distinction of self (intra-residue) and\nsequential (inter-residue) carbon correlation peaks; these appear opposite in\nsigns and therefore can easily be discriminated without using an additional\ncomplementary experiment. On top of all this, the main strength of the method\nis its efficient and robust assignment strategy based on: (a) multiple, but\nunidirectional sequential 15N and 13C correlations (i-->i-1) and (b) the\ndistinctive peak patterns of self and sequential peaks in different\n[(F1(13C)-F3(1H) and (F2(15N)-F3(1H)] planes of the 3D spectrum which enable\nready identification of certain specific triplet sequences (see the text) and\nthus serve as check points for mapping the stretches of sequentially connected\nHSQC cross peaks on to the primary sequence for assigning the resonances\nsequence specifically.

There is thus an increasing contention\non scarce data center resources like network bandwidth; further, the energy\nrequirements for powering the computing equipment are also growing\ndramatically. As we show empirically, increasing the execution parallelism by\nspreading out data across a large number of machines may achieve the intended\ngoal of decreasing query latencies, but in most cases, may increase the total\nresource and energy consumption significantly. For many analytical workloads,\nhowever, minimizing query latencies is often not critical; in such scenarios,\nwe argue that we should instead focus on minimizing the average query span,\ni.e., the average number of machines that are involved in processing of a\nquery, through colocation of data items that are frequently accessed together.\nIn this work, we exploit the fact that most distributed environments need to\nuse replication for fault tolerance, and we devise workload-driven replica\nselection and placement algorithms that attempt to minimize the average query\nspan. We model a historical query workload trace as a hypergraph over a set of\ndata items, and formulate and analyze the problem of replica placement by\ndrawing connections to several well-studied graph theoretic concepts. We\ndevelop a series of algorithms to decide which data items to replicate, and\nwhere to place the replicas.

These\nmodels give rise to superconductivity driven by lowering of kinetic energy when\nthe electronic energy band is almost full, with higher transition temperatures\nresulting when the ions are negatively charged. We show that the charge\ndistribution in dynamic Hubbard models can be highly inhomogeneous in the\npresence of disorder, and that a finite system will expel {\\it negative charge}\nfrom the interior to the surface, and that these tendencies are largest in the\nparameter regime where the models give rise to highest superconducting\ntransition temperatures. High $T_c$ cuprate materials exhibit charge\ninhomogeneity and they exhibit tunneling asymmetry, a larger tendency to emit\nelectrons rather than holes in NIS tunnel junctions. We propose that these\nproperties, as well as their high $T_c$'s, are evidence that they are governed\nby the physics described by dynamic Hubbard models. Below the superconducting\ntransition temperature the models considered here describe a negatively charged\nsuperfluid and positively charged quasiparticles, unlike the situation in\nconventional BCS superconductors where quasiparticles are charge neutral on\naverage.

We show how it can\nemerge in a simple way from the underlying microscopic quantum world governed\nby Schrodinger's equation without the need for observers or their brains. In\norder to achieve this, we assemble pieces of various pre-existing ideas.\nFirstly, we adopt a relational approach and use the eigenvectors of the reduced\ndensity matrix of a quantum sub-system, or equivalently the Schmidt\ndecomposition, to define the `internal state' of a sub-system. Previous work\nhas identified serious objections to such an interpretation because it\napparently leads to macroscopic superpositions and physically unacceptable\ninstabilities near degeneracies.

As this is not only interesting at\npresent times but also along the planetary evolution, we studied the effect\nthat the evolution of microbial mats and plants over land has had on the way\nour planet looks from afar. As life evolved, continental surfaces changed\ngradually and non- uniformly from deserts through microbial mats to land\nplants, modifying the reflective properties of the ground and most probably the\ndistribution of moisture and cloudiness. Here, we used a radiative transfer\nmodel of the Earth, together with geological paleo-records of the continental\ndistribution and a reconstructed cloud distribution, to simulate the visible\nand near-IR radiation reflected by our planet as a function of Earth's\nrotation. We found that the evolution from deserts to microbial mats and to\nland plants produces detectable changes in the globally-averaged Earth's\nreflectance. The variability of each surface type is located in different bands\nand can induce reflectance changes of up to 40% in period of hours.

Second, we show that there is no model-checking algorithm with\nelementary parameter dependence for MSO logic even restricted to paths (or\nequivalently to unary strings), unless E=NE. As a corollary, we resolve an open\nproblem on the complexity of MSO model-checking on graphs of bounded max-leaf\nnumber. Finally, we look at MSO on the class of colored trees of depth d. We\nshow that, assuming the ETH, for every fixed d>=1 at least d+1 levels of\nexponentiation are necessary for this problem, thus showing that the (d+1)-fold\nexponential algorithm recently given by Gajarsk\\`{y} and Hlin\\u{e}n\\`{y} is\nessentially optimal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Feb 2013 13:40:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 Mar 2014 12:16:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 24 Mar 2014 09:50:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-01"}

Recent\nwork suggests that modularity can evolve in a variety of circumstances,\nincluding goals that vary in time such that they share the same subgoals\n(modularly varying goals), or when connections are costly. Here, we studied the\norigin of modularity and sparseness focusing on the nature of the mutation\nprocess, rather than on connection cost or variations in the goal. We use\nsimulations of evolution with different mutation rules. We found that commonly\nused sum-rule mutations, in which interactions are mutated by adding random\nnumbers, do not lead to modularity or sparseness except for in special\nsituations. In contrast, product-rule mutations in which interactions are\nmutated by multiplying by random numbers - a better model for the effects of\nbiological mutations - led to sparseness naturally. When the goals of evolution\nare modular, in the sense that specific groups of inputs affect specific groups\nof outputs, product-rule mutations also lead to modular structure; sum-rule\nmutations do not.

Around\n$E_{cm}=m_{Z}$, due to the $Z^0$-boson resonance effect, total cross sections\nfor the channels via the $Z^0$-propagator become much larger than the channels\nvia the virtual photon propagator. We conclude that, in addition to the $B$\nfactories as BaBar and Belle and the hadronic colliders as Tevatron and LHC,\nsuch a super $Z$-factory will present an excellent platform for studying the\nheavy quarkonium properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Feb 2013 14:18:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 Apr 2013 12:14:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 23 May 2013 03:10:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-10"}

In a strict theoretical sense, however, neither the\nJeans nor the Bonnor-Ebert mass are meaningful when applied locally to\nsubstructure in a self-gravitating turbulent medium. For this reason, we\ninvestigate the local support by thermal pressure, turbulence, and magnetic\nfields against gravitational compression through an approach that is\nindependent of these concepts. At the centre of our approach is the dynamical\nequation for the divergence of the velocity field. We carry out a statistical\nanalysis of the source terms of the local compression rate (the negative time\nderivative of the divergence) for simulations of forced self-gravitating\nturbulence in periodic boxes with zero, weak, and moderately strong mean\nmagnetic fields (measured by the averages of the magnetic and thermal\npressures). We also consider the amplification of the magnetic field energy by\nshear and by compression. Thereby, we are able to demonstrate that the support\nagainst gravity is dominated by thermal pressure fluctuations, although\nmagnetic pressure also yields a significant contribution. The net effect of\nturbulence in the highly supersonic regime, however, is to enhance compression\nrather than supporting overdense gas even if the vorticity is very high. This\nis incommensurate with the support of the highly dynamical substructures in\nmagneto-turbulent fluids being determined by local virial equilibria of volume\nenergies without surface stresses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Feb 2013 14:44:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 23 Mar 2013 13:21:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

We\ndevelop a field-theoretic treatment to calculate, from first principles, the\nspace-time statistics of instantaneous velocities within an avalanche. For\nelastic interfaces at (or above) their (internal) upper critical dimension d >=\nd_uc (d_uc = 2, 4 respectively for long-ranged and short-ranged elasticity) we\nshow that the field theory for the center of mass reduces to the motion of a\npoint particle in a random-force landscape, which is itself a random walk (ABBM\nmodel). Furthermore, the full spatial dependence of the velocity correlations\nis described by the Brownian-force model (BFM) where each point of the\ninterface sees an independent Brownian-force landscape. Both ABBM and BFM can\nbe solved exactly in any dimension d (for monotonous driving) by summing tree\ngraphs, equivalent to solving a (non-linear) instanton equation. This tree\napproximation is the mean-field theory (MFT) for realistic interfaces in\nshort-ranged disorder. Both for the center of mass, and for a given Fourier\nmode q, we obtain probability distribution functions (PDF's) of the velocity,\nas well as the avalanche shape and its fluctuations (second shape). Within MFT\nwe find that velocity correlations at non-zero q are asymmetric under time\nreversal. Next we calculate, beyond MFT, i.e. including loop corrections, the\n1-time PDF of the center-of-mass velocity du/dt for dimension d< d_uc. The\nsingularity at small velocity P(du/dt) ~ 1/(du/dt)^a is substantially reduced\nfrom a=1 (MFT) to a = 1 - 2/9 (4-d) + ... (short-ranged elasticity) and a = 1 -\n4/9 (2-d) + ...

This\nscenario differs qualitatively from the standard view of adaptation in that the\nspeed of adaptation becomes independent of population size while the fitness\nvariance does not. Here we exploit recent progress in the understanding of\nsurface growth processes to obtain precise predictions for the universal,\nnon-Gaussian shape of the fitness distribution for one-dimensional habitats,\nwhich are verified by simulations. When the mutations are deleterious rather\nthan beneficial the problem becomes a spatial version of Muller's ratchet. In\ncontrast to the case of well-mixed populations, the rate of fitness decline\nremains finite even in the limit of an infinite habitat, provided the ratio\n$U_d/s^2$ between the deleterious mutation rate and the square of the\n(negative) selection coefficient is sufficiently large.
