To this end, we first analyze clusters of\nhighly mobile particles, the string-like collective motion of these mobile\nparticles, and clusters of relative low mobility. We show that the time scale\nof the high-mobility clusters and strings is associated with a diffusive time\nscale, while the low-mobility particles' time scale relates to a structural\nrelaxation time. We find a high degree of similarity in the geometrical\nstructure of these particle clusters. In particular, we show that the fractal\ndimensions of these clusters are consistent with those of swollen branched\npolymers or branched polymers with screened excluded-volume interactions. In\ncontrast, the fractal dimension of the strings crosses over from that of\nself-avoiding walks for small strings, to simple random walks for longer, {more\nstrongly interacting, strings, corresponding to flexible polymers with screened\nexcluded-volume interactions. We examine the appropriateness of identifying the\nsize scales of either mobile particle clusters or strings with the size of\ncooperatively rearranging regions (CRR) in the AG and RFOT theories.

According to this suggestion the SN progenitor\nsuffered a rapid expansion within months before explosion. The expansion was\ndriven by leakage of energy from the core where vigorous oxygen nuclear burning\ntakes place within a year prior to explosion. This expansion triggered mass\ntransfer onto the secondary star. Most of the extra energy of the outburst\ncomes from the accretion of ~0.1Mo onto the secondary star. As well, the gas\noutflowing at v~2000 km/s was launched from the accreting secondary star, most\nlikely in a bipolar outflow.

To address these concerns, we propose a privacy-preserving photo\nencoding algorithm that extracts and encrypts a small, but significant,\ncomponent of the photo, while preserving the remainder in a public,\nstandards-compatible, part.

This\ntechnique significantly reduces the signal-to-noise ratio and the accuracy of\nautomated detection and recognition on the public part, while preserving the\nability of the provider to perform server-side transformations to conserve\ndownload bandwidth usage.

A hallmark characteristic\nof these non-magnetic bulk insulators is the protected metallic electronic\nstates confined to the material's surfaces. Electrons in these surface states\nare spin polarized with their spins governed by their direction of travel\n(linear momentum), resulting in a helical spin texture in momentum space. Spin-\nand angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (spin-ARPES) has been the only\ntool capable of directly observing this central feature with simultaneous\nenergy, momentum, and spin sensitivity. By using an innovative photoelectron\nspectrometer with a high-flux laser-based light source, we discovered another\nsurprising property of these surface electrons which behave like Dirac\nfermions. We found that the spin polarization of the resulting photoelectrons\ncan be fully manipulated in all three dimensions through selection of the light\npolarization. These surprising effects are due to the spin-dependent\ninteraction of the helical Dirac fermions with light, which originates from the\nstrong spin-orbit coupling in the material. Our results illustrate unusual\nscenarios in which the spin polarization of photoelectrons is completely\ndifferent from the spin state of electrons in the originating initial states.\nThe results also provide the basis for a novel source of highly spin-polarized\nelectrons with tunable polarization in three dimensions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Feb 2013 20:20:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-16"}

The groups span\nthe redshift range $z\\sim0.066-1.544$ and virial mass range\n$M_{200}\\sim1.34\\times 10^{13}-1.33\\times 10^{14}M_\\odot$. For the 49 extended\nsources which lie within DEEP2 and DEEP3 Galaxy Redshift Survey coverage, we\nidentify spectroscopic counterparts and determine velocity dispersions. We\nselect member galaxies by applying different cuts along the line of sight or in\nprojected spatial coordinates. A constant cut along the line of sight can cause\na large scatter in scaling relations in low-mass or high-mass systems depending\non the size of cut. A velocity dispersion based virial radius can more\noverestimate velocity dispersion in comparison to X-ray based virial radius for\nlow mass systems. There is no significant difference between these two radial\ncuts for more massive systems. Independent of radial cut, overestimation of\nvelocity dispersion can be created in case of existence of significant\nsubstructure and also compactness in X-ray emission which mostly occur in low\nmass systems. We also present a comparison between X-ray galaxy groups and\noptical galaxy groups detected using the Voronoi-Delaunay method (VDM) for\nDEEP2 data in this field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Feb 2013 21:00:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-08"}

We use COSMOS to study in a self-consistent way the change in the\nnumber densities of quenched early-type galaxies (Q-ETGs) of a given size over\nthe interval 0.2 < z < 1.0 to study the claimed size evolution of these\ngalaxies. At 10^10.5<Mgalaxy<10^11 Msun, we see no change in the number density\nof compact Q-ETGs, while at >10^11 Msun we find a decrease by 30%. In both mass\nbins, the increase of the median sizes of Q-ETGs with time is primarily caused\nby the addition to the size function of larger and more diffuse Q-ETGs. At all\nmasses, compact Q-ETGs become systematically redder towards later epochs, with\na (U-V) difference consistent with passive evolution of their stellar\npopulations, indicating that they are a population that does not appreciably\nevolve in size. At all epochs, the larger Q-ETGs (at least in the lower mass\nbin) have average rest-frame colors systematically bluer than those of the more\ncompact Q-ETGs, suggesting that the former are younger than the latter. The\nidea that new, large, Q-ETGs are responsible for the observed growth in the\nmedian size of the population at a given mass is supported by the sizes and\nnumber of the star-forming galaxies that are expected to be progenitors of the\nnew Q-ETGs over the same period. In the low mass bin, the new Q-ETG have 30%\nsmaller sizes than their star-forming progenitors. This is likely due to the\nfading of their disks after they cease star-formation. Comparison with higher z\nshows that the median size of newly-quenched galaxies roughly scales, at\nconstant mass, as (1+z)^-1. The dominant cause of the size evolution seen in\nthe Q-ETG population is thus that the average sizes of individual Q-ETGs scale\nwith the average density of the Universe at the time when they were quenched,\nwith subsequent size changes in individual objects through eg merging of\nsecondary importance, especially at masses <10^11 Msun.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Feb 2013 21:00:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 Jul 2013 11:29:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

In particular, password management relies on assumptions\nabout human memory, e.g., that a user who follows a particular rehearsal\nschedule will successfully maintain the corresponding memory. These assumptions\nare informed by research in cognitive science and validated through empirical\nstudies. Given rehearsal requirements and a user's visitation schedule for each\naccount, we use the total number of extra rehearsals that the user would have\nto do to remember all of his passwords as a measure of the usability of the\npassword scheme.

However, most\nexisting work deals with networks that simply encode whether relationships\nexist or not. In contrast, relationships in signed networks can be positive\n(\"like\", \"trust\") or negative (\"dislike\", \"distrust\"). The theory of social\nbalance shows that signed networks tend to conform to some local patterns that,\nin turn, induce certain global characteristics. In this paper, we exploit both\nlocal as well as global aspects of social balance theory for two fundamental\nproblems in the analysis of signed networks: sign prediction and clustering.\nMotivated by local patterns of social balance, we first propose two families of\nsign prediction methods: measures of social imbalance (MOIs), and supervised\nlearning using high order cycles (HOCs). These methods predict signs of edges\nbased on triangles and \\ell-cycles for relatively small values of \\ell.\nInterestingly, by examining measures of social imbalance, we show that the\nclassic Katz measure, which is used widely in unsigned link prediction,\nactually has a balance theoretic interpretation when applied to signed\nnetworks. Furthermore, motivated by the global structure of balanced networks,\nwe propose an effective low rank modeling approach for both sign prediction and\nclustering. For the low rank modeling approach, we provide theoretical\nperformance guarantees via convex relaxations, scale it up to large problem\nsizes using a matrix factorization based algorithm, and provide extensive\nexperimental validation including comparisons with local approaches. Our\nexperimental results indicate that, by adopting a more global viewpoint of\nbalance structure, we get significant performance and computational gains in\nprediction and clustering tasks on signed networks. Our work therefore\nhighlights the usefulness of the global aspect of balance theory for the\nanalysis of signed networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Feb 2013 23:15:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Mar 2013 03:35:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-06"}

Methods: We used\nthe Roche potential modified to account for radiation pressure to compute the\nstellar surface of close circular systems and we used the TIDES code for\nsurface computation of eccentric systems. In both cases, we accounted for\ngravity darkening and mutual heating generated by irradiation to compute the\nsurface temperature. We then interpolated NLTE plane-parallel atmosphere model\nspectra in a grid to obtain the local spectrum at each surface point. We\nfinally summed all contributions, accounting for the Doppler shift,\nlimb-darkening, and visibility to obtain the total synthetic spectrum. We\ncomputed different orbital phases and sets of physical and orbital parameters.\nResults: Our models predict line strength variations through the orbital cycle,\nbut fail to completely reproduce the Struve-Sahade effect. Including radiation\npressure allows us to reproduce a surface temperature distribution that is\nconsistent with observations of semi-detached binary systems. Conclusions:\nRadiation pressure effects on the stellar surface are weak in (over)contact\nbinaries and well-detached systems but can become very significant in\nsemi-detached systems. The classical von Zeipel theorem is sufficient for the\nspectral computation. Broad-band light curves derived from the spectral\ncomputation are different from those computed with a model in which the stellar\nsurfaces are equipotentials of the Roche potential scaled by the instantaneous\norbital separation. In many cases, the fit of two Gaussian/Lorentzian profiles\nfails to properly measure the equivalent width of the lines and leads to\napparent variations that could explain some of the effects reported in the\nliterature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Feb 2013 06:59:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

Our goal is to explore the impact of trap\nlocation on the efficiency of trapping in these two important polymer systems,\nwith the efficiency being measured by the average trapping time (ATT) that is\nthe average of source-to-trap mean first-passage time over every staring point\nin the whole networks. For Cayley trees, we derive an exact analytic formula\nfor the ATT to an arbitrary trap node, based on which we further obtain the\nexplicit expression of ATT for the case that the trap is uniformly distributed.\nFor Vicsek fractals, we provide the closed-form solution for ATT to a\nperipheral node farthest from the central node, as well as the numerical\nsolutions for the case when the trap is placed on other nodes. Moreover, we\nderive the exact formula for the ATT corresponding to the trapping problem when\nthe trap has an uniform distribution over all nodes. Our results show that the\ninfluence of trap location on the trapping efficiency is completely different\nfor the two polymer networks. In Cayley trees, the leading scaling of ATT\nincreases with the shortest distance between the trap and the central node,\nimplying that trap's position has an essential impact on the trapping\nefficiency; while in Vicsek fractals, the effect of location of the trap is\nnegligible, since the dominant behavior of ATT is identical, respective of the\nlocation where the trap is placed.

Numerical methods testing the SUSY models often report a good\nlikelihood L (or chi^2=-2ln L) to fit the data {\\it including} the EW scale\nitself (m_Z^0) with a {\\it simultaneously} large fine-tuning i.e. a large\nvariation of this scale under a small variation of the SUSY parameters. We\nargue that this is inconsistent and we identify the origin of this problem. Our\nclaim is that the likelihood (or chi^2) to fit the data that is usually\nreported in such models does not account for the chi^2 cost of fixing the EW\nscale. When this constraint is implemented, the likelihood (or chi^2) receives\na significant correction (delta_chi^2) that worsens the current data fits of\nSUSY models. We estimate this correction for the models: constrained MSSM\n(CMSSM), models with non-universal gaugino masses (NUGM) or higgs soft masses\n(NUHM1, NUHM2), the NMSSM and the general NMSSM (GNMSSM). For a higgs mass\nm_h\\approx 126 GeV, one finds that in these models (delta_chi^2)/ndf> 1.5\n(approx 1 for GNMSSM), which violates the usual condition of a good fit (total\nchi^2/ndf approx 1) already before fitting observables other than the EW scale\nitself (ndf=number of degrees of freedom). This has (negative) implications for\nSUSY models and it is suggested that future data fits properly account for this\neffect, if one remains true to the original goal of SUSY. Since the expression\nof delta_chi^2 that emerges from our calculation depends on a familiar measure\nof fine-tuning, one concludes that EW fine-tuning is an intrinsic part of the\nlikelihood to fit the data that includes the EW scale (m_Z^0).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Feb 2013 12:06:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 May 2013 18:27:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 16 Jul 2013 20:40:41 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 4 Aug 2013 21:14:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

However, their implementation\nin practical applications has been severely hampered due to the breakdown of\ntheir magnetotransport properties at temperatures well below their magnetic\ntransition temperature. This breakdown has been usually associated to surface\nand interface related problems but its physical origin has not been clearly\nestablished yet. In this work we investigate the interface between\nLa2/3Sr1/3MnO3 (LSMO) thin films and different capping layers by means of x-ray\nlinear dichroism and transport measurements. Our data reveal that, irrespective\nto the capping material, LSMO/capping layer bilayers exhibit an\nantiferromegnetic/insulating phase at the interface, likely to originate from a\npreferential occupancy of Mn 3d 3z2-r2 eg orbitals. This phase, which extends\nca. 2 unit cells, is also observed in an uncapped LSMO reference sample thus,\npointing to an intrinsic interfacial phase separation phenomenon, likely to be\npromoted by the structural disruption and symmetry breaking at the LSMO free\nsurface/interface. These experimental observations strongly suggest that the\nstructural disruption at the LSMO interfaces play a major role on the observed\ndepressed magnetotransport properties in manganite-based magnetic tunneling\njunctions and it is at the origin of the so-called dead layer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Feb 2013 14:40:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-22"}

We consider the\ncase where the dark matter is a scalar and study its coannihilations with the\nright-handed neutrinos. These coannihilations tend to increase, rather than\nreduce, the dark matter density and they modify in a significant way the viable\nparameter space of the model. In particular, they allow to satisfy the relic\ndensity constraint for dark matter masses well below 500 GeV. The dependence of\nthe relic density on the relevant parameters of the model, such as the dark\nmatter mass, the mass splitting, and the number of coannihilating fermions, is\nanalyzed in detail. We also investigate, via a scan over the parameter space,\nthe new viable regions that are obtained when coannihilations are taken into\naccount. Notably, they feature large indirect detection rates, with sigmav\nreaching values of order 10^{-24} cm^3/s. Finally, we emphasize that\ncoannihilation effects analogous to those discussed here can be used to\nreconcile a thermal freeze-out with a large sigmav also in other models of dark\nmatter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Feb 2013 15:01:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 22 Feb 2013 10:43:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-17"}

We first present the\nmid-infrared (MIR) properties of the H-alpha-selected galaxies in a rich\ncluster Cl0939+4713 at z=0.4. With a MIR stacking analysis, we find that the\nmedian SFR of H-alpha emitters is higher in higher-density environment at\nz=0.4.

This increase of SSFR in high-density environment is\nnot visible when we consider the SFR derived from H-alpha alone, suggesting\nthat the dust attenuation in galaxies depends on environment; galaxies in\nhigh-density environment tend to be dustier (by up to ~0.5 mag).

By using the\ncanonical form of Abel equation, the polynomial Appell invariant make the\nequation integrable in terms of Weierstrass $\\wp$ functions. We will use a\ngeneral formalism based on Ince's transformation to write the general solution\nof dissipative BBM in terms of $\\wp$ functions, from which all the other known\nsolutions can be obtained via simplifying assumptions. Using ODE analysis we\nshow that the traveling wave speed is a bifurcation parameter that makes\ntransition between different classes of waves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Feb 2013 18:32:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 Apr 2013 23:40:46 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 8 Nov 2017 19:45:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-13"}

In this paper, we\npropose and analyze a new interpretation of the wave-particle duality, and\npropose a new rule that relates the corpuscular and wave properties of quantum\nparticles, and replaces the Born's rule. We introduce a new representation\nabout quantum particles as temporary objects that are born permanently in a\nwave field and spontaneously decayed due to their \"instability\". Thus, we fill\nwith the physical meaning the standard notions of \"creation\" and \"annihilation\"\nof the particles, used in the second quantization formalism. We show that the\ntraditional probabilistic interpretation of quantum mechanics in the form of\nthe Born's rule is an approximate consequence of the proposed theory. The\nproposed theory allows explaining the indistinguishability of quantum particles\nand shows meaninglessness of the concept of their trajectories. We give an\nexplanation of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle within the limits of this\ntheory in terms of classical physics that allows us to return to an objective\nunderstanding of the measurement process and do not consider it as a compulsory\npart of the physical process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Feb 2013 12:35:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

Requiring that this velocity is\nequal to the speed of light constrains our model of vacuum. Within this\napproach, the propagation of a photon is a statistical process at scales much\nlarger than the Planck scale. Therefore we expect its time of flight to\nfluctuate.

At array stations, cross correlation\ndemonstrates a higher resolution because the time delays at individual sensors\nfrom master and slave events are the same but they may differ from theoretical\nones used in standard beamforming. In the regions where master events and thus\nwaveform templates are available, one can reduce the amplitude threshold of\nsignal detection by a factor of 2 to 3 relative to standard beamforming and\nSTA/LTA detector used at the International Data Centre. The gain in sensitivity\ncorresponds to a body wave magnitude reduction by 0.3 to 0.4 units and doubles\nthe number of detected events. This gain is crucial for seismic monitoring\nunder the CTBT. The coverage by real master events is sparse and confined to\nareas with historical seismicity, however. In two parts of this study, we\ninvestigate the possibility to populate the global grid with real and synthetic\nmaster events. In Part I, we replicate a high-quality master event over a\nregular grid several hundred kilometers from its actual position. In Part II,\nwe model waveform templates using synthetic seismograms with the aim to apply\nthem in aseismic zones. Both approaches are tested using the aftershock\nsequence of the April 11, 2012 Sumatera earthquake (Ms(IDC)=8.2). We used\nsixteen master events to recover the aftershocks in the Reviewed Event Bulletin\nof the IDC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Feb 2013 09:45:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-27"}
