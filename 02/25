First, we consider\nBR(Bs->\\mu\\mu), which has recently been for the first time measured by LHCb. In\nthe CMSSM we show that ultimate, but realistic, improvement in the\ndetermination of the observable to about 5-10% around the Standard Model value\nwould strongly disfavor the A-funnel region, while not affecting much the other\nfavored regions. Second, we show that all the favored regions of the CMSSM will\nbe, for the most part, sensitive to direct dark matter searches in future\none-tonne detectors. A signal at low WIMP mass (<=450 GeV) and low\nspin-independent cross section would then strongly favor the stau\ncoannihilation region while a signal at higher WIMP mass (~800 GeV to ~1.2 TeV)\nwould clearly point to the region where the neutralino is higgsino-like with\nmass ~1 TeV. A nearly complete experimental testing of the CMSSM over multi-TeV\nranges of superpartner masses, far beyond the reach of direct SUSY searches at\nthe LHC, can therefore be achievable.

It is shown that\na dipole with small polarizability can dramatically influence the dipole moment\nof a distant polarizable dipole, if it is appropriately placed. We call this\nthe searchlight effect, as the enhancement depends on the orientation of the\nline joining the polarizable dipoles and can be varied by changing the\nfrequency. For some particular polarizabilities the enhancement can actually\nincrease the further the polarizable dipoles are apart.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Feb 2013 02:38:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-21"}

Superconductivity in such a system is accomplished by a\ntwo-dimensional Wigner crystal consisting of one-dimensional Wigner crystals\nformed by bosons, i.e., singlet electron pairs that are in the same\nquasi-one-dimensional state extending along the ion chain, which corresponds to\na delocalized $\\pi$ orbital in chemistry. The model applicability to three\ndifferent classes of materials (cuprates, picene, iron pnictides) indicates\nthat it can prove useful for development of the theory of superconductivity\ntaking into consideraion the highly correlated state of valence electrons and\nstrong Coulomb interactions between the electrons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Feb 2013 06:30:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Mar 2013 07:39:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 20 Jun 2013 06:00:13 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 22 Jun 2013 08:15:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

The gradient\ntrace of the electric potential on this free boundary part acts as a source\nterm in the governing equation for the membrane deformation.

This increased\navailability of heterogeneous biological data has resulted in biological\napplications where a multiple sequence alignment (msa) is required for aligning\nsimilar features, where a feature is described in structural, functional or\nevolutionary terms. In these applications, for a given set of sequences,\ndepending on the feature of interest the optimal msa is likely to be different,\nand sequence similarity can only be used as a rough initial estimate on the\naccuracy of an msa. This has motivated the growth in template based heuristics\nthat supplement the sequence information with evolutionary, structural and\nfunctional data and exploit feature similarity instead of sequence similarity\nto construct multiple sequence alignments that are biologically more accurate.\nHowever, current frameworks for designing template based heuristics do not\nallow the user to explicitly specify information that can help to classify\nfeatures into types and associate weights signifying the relative importance of\na feature with respect to other features. In this paper, we first provide a\nmechanism where as a part of the template information the user can explicitly\nspecify for each feature, its type, and weight. The type is to classify the\nfeatures into different categories based on their characteristics and the\nweight signifies the relative importance of a feature with respect to other\nfeatures in that sequence. Second, we exploit the above information to define\nscoring models for pair-wise sequence alignment that assume segment\nconservation as opposed to single character (residue) conservation. Finally, we\npresent a fast progressive alignment based heuristic framework that helps in\nconstructing a global msa efficiently.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Feb 2013 09:55:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-26"}

This is done\nby a detailed analysis of the excitation properties of the ground state and the\ntorsionally excited states, v11=1 and v15=1, toward the high-mass star-forming\nregion G327.3-0.6. With the Atacama Pathfinder EXperiment 12 m submillimeter\ntelescope, we performed a spectral line survey. The observed spectrum is\nmodeled assuming local thermal equilibrium. CH3OCH3 has been detected in the\nground state, and in the torsionally excited states v11=1 and v15=1, for which\nlines have been detected here for the first time. The emission is modeled with\nan isothermal source structure as well as with a non-uniform spherical\nstructure. For non-uniform source models one abundance jump for dimethyl ether\nis sufficient to fit the emission, but two components are needed for the\nisothermal models. This suggests that dimethyl ether is present in an extended\nregion of the envelope and traces a non-uniform density and temperature\nstructure. Both types of models furthermore suggest that most dimethyl ether is\npresent in gas that is warmer than 100 K, but a smaller fraction of 5%-28% is\npresent at temperatures between 70 and 100 K. The dimethyl ether present in\nthis cooler gas is likely formed in the solid state, while gas phase formation\nprobably is dominant above 100 K. Finally, the v11=1 and v15=1 torsionally\nexcited states are easily excited under the density and temperature conditions\nin G327.3-0.6 and will thus very likely be detectable in other hot cores as\nwell.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Feb 2013 10:40:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-06"}

However, the ability to carry out effective\nmatched-filter based searches for these systems is limited by the lack of\nreliable waveforms. Here we consider binaries in which the intermediate-mass\nblack hole has mass in the range 24 - 200 solar masses with a stellar-mass\ncompanion having masses in the range 1.4 - 18.5 solar masses. In addition, we\nconstrain the mass ratios, q, of the binaries to be in the range 1/140 < q <\n1/10 and we restrict our study to the case of circular binaries with\nnon-spinning components. We investigate the relative contribution to the\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the three different phases of the coalescence:\ninspiral, merger and ringdown.

It has been postulated that SMSs forms through very\nrapid mass accretion onto a protostar at a high rate exceeding 0.01 Msun/yr.\nAccording to recent studies, such rapidly accreting protostars evolve into\n\"supergiant protostars\", i.e. protostars consisting of a bloated envelope and a\ncontracting core, similar to giant star. However, like massive stars as well as\ngiant stars, both of which are known to be pulsationally unstable, supergiant\nprotostars may also be also unstable to launch strong pulsation-driven\noutflows. If this is the case, the stellar growth via accretion will be\nhindered by the mass loss. We here study the pulsational stability of the\nsupergiant protostars in the mass range M<10^3 Msun through the method of the\nlinear perturbation analysis. We find that the supergiant protostars with M>600\nMsun and very high accretion rate Mdot>1.0 Msun/yr are unstable due to the\nkappa mechanism. The pulsation is excited in the He^+ ionization layer in the\nenvelope. Even under a conservative assumption that all the pulsation energy is\nconverted into the kinetic energy of the outflows, the mass-loss rate is ~10^-3\nMsun/yr, which is lower than the accretion rate by more than two orders of\nmagnitude. We thus conclude that the supergiant protostars should grow stably\nvia rapid accretion at least in the mass range we studied. As long as the rapid\naccretion is maintained in the later stage, protostars will become SMSs, which\neventually produce seeds for the high-z SMBHs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Feb 2013 11:53:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

The selection of the number, d, of the FPC's to be used in a specific\nprocedure has attracted a fair amount of attention, and a number of reasonably\neffective approaches exist. Intuitively, they assume that the functional data\ncan be sufficiently well approximated by a projection onto a finite-dimensional\nsubspace, and the error resulting from such an approximation does not impact\nthe conclusions. This has been shown to be a very effective approach, but it is\ndesirable to understand the behavior of many inferential procedures by\nconsidering the projections on subspaces spanned by an increasing number of the\nFPC's. Such an approach reflects more fully the infinite-dimensional nature of\nfunctional data, and allows to derive procedures which are fairly insensitive\nto the selection of d. This is accomplished by considering limits as d tends to\ninfinity with the sample size.\n  We propose a specific framework in which we let d tend to infinity by\nderiving a normal approximation for the two-parameter partial sum process of\nthe scores \\xi_{i,j} of the i-th function with respect to the j-th FPC. Our\napproximation can be used to derive statistics that use segments of\nobservations and segments of the FPC's.

We define social resilience as the ability of a community to\nwithstand changes. We do not argue about the cause of such changes, but\nconcentrate on their impact. Changes may cause users to leave, which may\ntrigger further leaves of others who lost connection to their friends. This may\nlead to cascades of users leaving. A social network is said to be resilient if\nthe size of such cascades can be limited. To quantify resilience, we use the\nk-core analysis, to identify subsets of the network in which all users have at\nleast k friends. These connections generate benefits (b) for each user, which\nhave to outweigh the costs (c) of being a member of the network. If this\ndifference is not positive, users leave. After all cascades, the remaining\nnetwork is the k-core of the original network determined by the cost-to-benefit\nc/b ratio. By analysing the cumulative distribution of k-cores we are able to\ncalculate the number of users remaining in each community. This allows us to\ninfer the impact of the c/b ratio on the resilience of these online\ncommunities. We find that the different online communities have different\nk-core distributions. Consequently, similar changes in the c/b ratio have a\ndifferent impact on the amount of active users. As a case study, we focus on\nthe evolution of Friendster. We identify time periods when new users entering\nthe network observed an insufficient c/b ratio. This measure can be seen as a\nprecursor of the later collapse of the community. Our analysis can be applied\nto estimate the impact of changes in the user interface, which may temporarily\nincrease the c/b ratio, thus posing a threat for the community to shrink, or\neven to collapse.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Feb 2013 14:47:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-11"}

Unlike other quasiparticle\nBEC systems, this system has a spectrum with two degenerate minima, which makes\nit possible for the system to have two condensates in momentum space. Recent\nBrillouin Light scattering studies for a microwave-pumped YIG film of thickness\nd=5 $\\mu$m and field H=1 kOe find a low-contrast interference pattern at the\ncharacteristic wavevector $Q$ of the magnon energy minimum. In this report, we\nshow that this modulation pattern can be quantitatively explained as due to\nnon-symmetric but coherent Bose-Einstein condensation of magnons into the two\nenergy minima. Our theory predicts a transition from a high-contrast symmetric\nphase to a low-contrast non-symmetric phase on varying the $d$ and $H$, and a\nnew type of collective oscillations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Feb 2013 15:37:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-06"}

The\npartition function can be expressed as the vacuum expectation value of an\noperator on the Fock space of 2D complex free fermion fields. The quantum torus\nalgebra of fermion bilinears behind this expression is shown to have an\nextended set of \"shift symmetries\". They are used to prove that the partition\nfunction (deformed by external potentials) is essentially a tau function of the\n2D Toda hierarchy. This special solution of the 2D Toda hierarchy can be\ncharacterized by a factorization problem of $\\ZZ\\times\\ZZ$ matrices as well.\nThe associated Lax operators turn out to be quotients of first order difference\noperators. This implies that the solution of the 2D Toda hierarchy in question\nis actually a solution of the Ablowitz-Ladik (equivalently, relativistic Toda)\nhierarchy. As a byproduct, the shift symmetries are shown to be related to\nmatrix-valued quantum dilogarithmic functions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Feb 2013 15:48:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 12 May 2013 00:19:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-31"}
