We\npropose an alternative construction of the spacetime manifold which naturally\nenables time anisotropy. We promote the role of curvature: the Ricci scalar R\nat a given point sets the length scales for physical processes - including\ngravity - in the local inertial frames enclosing that point. The manifold is a\npatchwork of local regions; each region is Lorentz invariant and adopts a local\nscale a_R defined as a_R = 1/sqrt|R|. In each local patch, the length scales of\nphysical processes are measured relatively to a_R, and only their dimensionless\nratios partake in the dynamics of physical processes. Time anisotropy arises by\nrequiring that the form - but not necessarily the parameters - of physical laws\nbe unchanged under variations of the local a_R as one moves on the manifold.\nThe time scaling is found to be dt ~ a_R^(3/2) whereas the spatial part scales\nas dx ~ a_R.\n  We show how to conjoin the local patches of the manifold in a way which\nrespects causality and special relativity, as well as the equivalence and\ngeneral covariance principles.

Differential cross sections are presented as a function of the\njet rapidities (y), lepton transverse momentum (p_T) and pseudorapidity (\\eta),\nthe scalar sum of the transverse energies of the W boson and all jets (H_T),\nleading dijet p_T and invariant mass, dijet rapidity separations for a variety\nof jet pairings for p_T-ordered and angular-ordered jets, dijet opening angle,\ndijet azimuthal angular separations for p_T-ordered and angular-ordered jets,\nand W boson transverse momentum. The mean number of jets in an event containing\na W boson is measured as a function of H_T, and as a function of the rapidity\nseparations between the two highest-p_T jets and between the most widely\nseparated jets in rapidity. Finally, the probability for third-jet emission in\nevents containing a W boson and at least two jets is studied by measuring the\nfraction of events in the inclusive W+2-jet sample that contain a third jet\nover a p_T threshold.

The stationary reduced density matrix of the quantum dot is determined\nby the use of the density matrix kernel, while the current kernel is used in a\nsecond step to determine the stationary current across the dot. If the\ntunneling Hamiltonian is multiplied by a coupling parameter ``w``, then\neverything, including the kernels, the stationary density matrix as well as the\nstationary current, can be viewed as a function of w. In the time space, and at\nevery single and fixed time t, the kernels have the clear structure of a\nconvergent power series in w. Refer to the coefficients of these power series\nas the orders of the kernels. It is intuitive to truncate the kernels at some\nfinite order and to perform remaining calculations by the use of the\ncorresponding approximate kernels. However, the quantities which actually\nappear in the calculations are not the kernels as a function of time but rather\ntheir Laplace transforms, and here only in the limit \\lambda \\to 0. The\nstatement that even in this limit the structure of a convergent power series in\nthe coupling parameter is still conserved is shown in the text.

The Fourier transform of a narrow-band signal, with a\ndiscontinuous amplitude and/or phase function, exhibits spectral and temporal\nspreading. The proposed method aims to avoid such spreading by explicitly\nmodeling the signal of interest as a sum of sinusoids with time-varying\namplitudes. So as to accommodate abrupt changes, it is further assumed that the\namplitude/phase functions are approximately piecewise constant (i.e., their\ntime-derivatives are sparse). The proposed method is based on a convex\nvariational (optimization) approach wherein the total variation (TV) of the\namplitude functions are regularized subject to a perfect (or approximate)\nreconstruction constraint. A computationally efficient algorithm is derived\nbased on convex optimization techniques.

The crucial parameter determining\nthe ejecta mass is the radius R_1.35 of a 1.35 M_sun NS. NSs with smaller\nR_1.35 (\"soft\" EoS) eject systematically higher masses. These range from ~10^-3\nM_sun to ~10^-2 M_sun for 1.35-1.35 M_sun binaries and from ~5*10^-3 M_sun to\n~2*10^-2 M_sun for 1.2-1.5 M_sun systems (with kinetic energies between\n~5*10^49 erg and 10^51 erg).

We find that an infinitesimal amount of disorder can completely suppress\nswarming for particles that utilize only alignment interactions suggesting that\nalignment alone is insufficient. The addition of repulsive forces between\nparticles produces a critical phase transition from a collectively moving swarm\nto a disordered gas-like state. This novel phase transition is entirely driven\nby the amount of topological disorder in the particles environment and displays\ncritical features that are similar to those of 2D percolation, while occurring\nat a value of disorder that is far from the percolation critical point.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Feb 2013 20:19:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-26"}

The dust transfers momentum to the surrounding gas through\ncollisions and thereby triggers a general outflow. Radiation-hydrodynamical\nmodels of M-type AGB stars suggest that these winds can be driven by photon\nscattering -- in contrast to absorption -- on Fe-free silicate grains of sizes\n0.1--1\\,$\\mu$m. In this paper we study photometric constraints for wind-driving\ndust species in M-type AGB stars, as part of an ongoing effort to identify\nlikely candidates among the grain materials observed in circumstellar\nenvelopes. To investigate the scenario of stellar winds driven by photon\nscattering on dust, and to explore how different optical and chemical\nproperties of wind-driving dust species affect photometry we focus on two sets\nof dynamical models atmospheres: (i) models using a detailed description for\nthe growth of Mg$_2$SiO$_4$ grains, taking into account both scattering and\nabsorption cross-sections when calculating the radiative acceleration, and (ii)\nmodels using a parameterized dust description, constructed to represent\ndifferent chemical and optical dust properties. By comparing synthetic\nphotometry from these two sets of models to observations of M-type AGB stars we\ncan provide constraints on the properties of wind-driving dust species.\nPhotometry from wind models with a detailed description for the growth of\nMg$_2$SiO$_4$ grains reproduces well both the values and the time-dependent\nbehavior of observations of M-type AGB stars, providing further support for the\nscenario of winds driven by photon scattering on dust.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Feb 2013 20:41:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

It turns out that the perturbative approach is\ninvalidated by a high occupation of the Bogoliubov modes. Recently, it was\nproposed that a black hole is a Bose-Einstein condensate of gravitons that\ndynamically ensures to stay at the verge of a quantum phase transition.

Unfortunately, marginal MAP can be NP-hard even on trees, and has\nattracted less attention in the literature compared to the joint MAP\n(maximization) and marginalization problems. We derive a general dual\nrepresentation for marginal MAP that naturally integrates the marginalization\nand maximization operations into a joint variational optimization problem,\nmaking it possible to easily extend most or all variational-based algorithms to\nmarginal MAP. In particular, we derive a set of \"mixed-product\" message passing\nalgorithms for marginal MAP, whose form is a hybrid of max-product, sum-product\nand a novel \"argmax-product\" message updates. We also derive a class of\nconvergent algorithms based on proximal point methods, including one that\ntransforms the marginal MAP problem into a sequence of standard marginalization\nproblems. Theoretically, we provide guarantees under which our algorithms give\nglobally or locally optimal solutions, and provide novel upper bounds on the\noptimal objectives.

Far from the Galactic plane (|b| > 30 degrees), the observed\ngamma-ray emission is nearly invariant with latitude, and is consistent with\narising from inverse Compton scattering of the interstellar radiation field by\ncosmic-ray electrons with an approximately power-law spectrum. The same\nelectrons in the presence of microgauss-scale magnetic fields can also generate\nthe the observed microwave \"haze\". At lower latitudes (b < 20 degrees), in\ncontrast, the spectrum of the emission correlated with the Bubbles possesses a\npronounced spectral feature peaking at 1-4 GeV (in E^2 dN/dE) which cannot be\ngenerated by any realistic spectrum of electrons. Instead, we conclude that a\nsecond (non-inverse-Compton) emission mechanism must be responsible for the\nbulk of the low-energy, low-latitude emission. This second component is\nspectrally similar to the excess GeV emission previously reported from the\nGalactic Center (GC), and also appears spatially consistent with a luminosity\nper volume falling approximately as r^-2.4, where r is the distance from the\nGC. We argue that the spectral feature visible in the low-latitude Bubbles is\nthe extended counterpart of the GC excess, now detected out to at least 2-3 kpc\nfrom the GC. The spectrum and angular distribution of the signal is consistent\nwith that predicted from ~10 GeV dark matter particles annihilating to leptons,\nor from ~50 GeV dark matter particles annihilating to quarks, following a\ndistribution similar to the canonical Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile. We\nalso consider millisecond pulsars as a possible astrophysical explanation for\nthe signal, as observed millisecond pulsars possess a spectral cutoff at\napproximately the required energy. Any such scenario would require a large\npopulation of unresolved millisecond pulsars extending at least 2-3 kpc from\nthe GC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Feb 2013 21:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-28"}

We resolve two structural components with distinct stellar\npopulations, a morphology more akin to merging and interacting systems. We also\nfind strong evidence of a truncated, Schechter-type mass function, and a\nsimilarly segmented luminosity function. These results indicate that binning\nmust erase much of the substructure present in the mass and luminosity\nfunctions, and might account for the conflicting reports on the intrinsic shape\nof these functions in the literature. We also note a tidal feature in the\noutskirts of the galaxy in GALEX UV imaging, and follow it up with a\ncomprehensive multi-wavelength study of NGC 4041 and its parent group. We\ndeduce a minor merger as a likely cause of its segmented structure and the\nobserved pattern of a radially decreasing star formation rate. We propose that\ncombining the study of star cluster populations with broad-band metrics is not\nonly advantageous, but often easily achievable through archival datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Feb 2013 21:05:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

We use a comprehensive one-dimensional photochemistry model and\nradiative transfer model to investigate the sulfur chemistry in atmospheres\nranging from reducing to oxidizing. The most important finding is that both H2S\nand SO2 are chemically short-lived in virtually all types of atmospheres on\nterrestrial exoplanets, based on models of H2, N2, and CO2 atmospheres. This\nimplies that direct detection of surface sulfur emission is unlikely, as their\nsurface emission rates need to be extremely high (>1000 times Earth's volcanic\nsulfur emission) for these gases to build up to a detectable level. We also\nfind that sulfur compounds emitted from the surface lead to photochemical\nformation of elemental sulfur and sulfuric acid in the atmosphere, which would\ncondense to form aerosols if saturated.

In\nthis paper, we use the variational principle of conformation dynamics to derive\nan optimal way of identifying the \"slow subspace\" of a large set of prior order\nparameters - either generic internal coordinates (distances and dihedral\nangles), or a user-defined set of parameters. It is shown that a method to\nidentify this slow subspace exists in statistics: the time-lagged independent\ncomponent analysis (TICA). Furthermore, optimal indicators-order parameters\nindicating the progress of the slow transitions and thus may serve as reaction\ncoordinates-are readily identified. We demonstrate that the slow subspace is\nwell suited to construct accurate kinetic models of two sets of molecular\ndynamics simulations, the 6-residue fluorescent peptide MR121-GSGSW and the\n30-residue natively disordered peptide KID. The identified optimal indicators\nreveal the structural changes associated with the slow processes of the\nmolecular system under analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Feb 2013 22:24:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

Galaxy groups are thought to\nplay an important role in shaping the physical properties of galaxies before\nentering massive clusters at low redshift, and transformations of satellite\ngalaxies likely dominate the buildup of local environmental correlations. To\nilluminate the physical processes that shape galaxy evolution in dense\nenvironments, we study a sample of 116 X-ray selected galaxy groups at z=0.2-1\nwith halo masses of 10^13-10^14 M_sun and centroids determined with weak\nlensing. We analyze morphologies based on HST imaging and colors determined\nfrom 31 photometric bands for a stellar mass-limited population of 923\nsatellite galaxies and a comparison sample of 16644 field galaxies. Controlling\nfor variations in stellar mass across environments, we find significant trends\nin the colors and morphologies of satellite galaxies with group-centric\ndistance and across cosmic time. Specifically at low stellar mass\n(log(M_stellar/M_sun) = 9.8-10.3), the fraction of disk-dominated star-forming\ngalaxies declines from >50% among field galaxies to <20% among satellites near\nthe centers of groups. This decline is accompanied by a rise in quenched\ngalaxies with intermediate bulge+disk morphologies, and only a weak increase in\nred bulge-dominated systems. These results show that both color and morphology\nare influenced by a galaxy's location within a group halo. We suggest that\nstrangulation and disk fading alone are insufficient to explain the observed\nmorphological dependence on environment, and that galaxy mergers or close tidal\nencounters must play a role in building up the population of quenched galaxies\nwith bulges seen in dense environments at low redshift.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Feb 2013 22:52:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 May 2013 16:31:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

The social consequence of a top-down approach to\nproduct development has been a large failure rate in new product introduction.\nBy surveying potential customers, a refined target is created that guides\ndevelopers and reduces the failure rate. Today, however, the proliferation of\nproducts and the emergence of consumer choice has resulted in the\nidentification of segments within the market. Understanding your target market\ntypically involves conducting a product category assessment, where 12 to 30\ncommercial products are tested with consumers to create a preference map.

The large abundance gradient across M101 (a factor of 20)\nsuggests that many more WR stars must be found in the inner parts of this\ngalaxy than in the outer regions. Many HII regions and massive star-forming\ncomplexes have been identified in M101; they should be rich in WR stars, and\nsurrounded by RSG stars. Finally, the Wolf-Rayet stars in M101 may be abundant\nenough for one to explode as a Type Ib or Ic supernova and/or GRB within a\ngeneration. The clear identification of the progenitor of a Type Ib or Ic\nsupernova as a WR star would be a major confirmation of current stellar\nevolution theory.\n  Motivated by these considerations, we have used the Hubble Space Telescope to\ncarry out a deep, HeII optical narrowband imaging survey of the massive star\npopulations in the ScI spiral galaxy M101. Combined with archival broadband\nimages, we were able to image almost the entire galaxy with the unprecedented\ndepth and resolution that only HST affords.\n  We describe the extent of the survey and our images, as well as our data\nreduction procedures. A detailed study of a field east of the center of M101,\ncontaining the giant star-forming region NGC 5462, demonstrates how we find\ncandidates, their properties and spatial distribution, and how we rule out most\ncontaminants. The spatial distributions of the WR and RSG stars near a giant\nstar-forming complex are strikingly different. WR stars dominate the complex\ncore, while RSG dominate the complex halo. Future papers in this series will\ndescribe and catalog more than a thousand WR and RSG candidates that are\ndetectable in our images, as well as spectra of many of those candidates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Feb 2013 00:19:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

In many solid-state quantum\nsystems, these operations rely on disparate techniques that can vary widely\ndepending on the particular qubit structure. One such qubit, the\nnitrogen-vacancy (NV) center spin in diamond, can be initialized and read out\nthrough its special spin selective intersystem crossing, while microwave\nelectron spin resonance (ESR) techniques provide unitary spin rotations.\nInstead, we demonstrate an alternative, fully optical approach to these control\nprotocols in an NV center that does not rely on its intersystem crossing. By\ntuning an NV center to an excited-state spin anticrossing at cryogenic\ntemperatures, we use coherent population trapping and stimulated Raman\ntechniques to realize initialization, readout, and unitary manipulation of a\nsingle spin. Each of these techniques can be directly performed along any\narbitrarily-chosen quantum basis, removing the need for extra control steps to\nmap the spin to and from a preferred basis. Combining these protocols, we\nperform measurements of the NV center's spin coherence, a demonstration of this\nfull optical control. Consisting solely of optical pulses, these techniques\nenable control within a smaller footprint and within photonic networks.\nLikewise, this approach obviates the need for both ESR manipulation and spin\naddressability through the intersystem crossing. This method could therefore be\napplied to a wide range of potential solid-state qubits, including those which\ncurrently lack a means to be addressed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Feb 2013 01:09:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 Mar 2013 01:28:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-08"}

This conjecture, put forward by Penrose more\nthan four decades ago, is widely believed to be one of the basic principles of\nnature. However, a complete proof of this hypothesis is still lacking and the\nvalidity of the conjecture has therefore remained one of the most important\nopen questions in general relativity. In this study we analyze a gedanken\nexperiment which is designed to challenge cosmic censorship by trying to\novercharge a Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om black hole: a charged shell is lowered {\\it\nadiabatically} into the charged black hole. The mass-energy delivered to the\nblack hole can be red-shifted by letting the dropping point of the shell\napproach the black-hole horizon. On the other hand, the electric charge of the\nshell is not red-shifted by the gravitational field of the black hole. It\ntherefore seems, at first sight, that the charged shell is not hindered from\nentering the black hole, overcharging it and removing its horizon. However, in\nthe present study we prove that the exposure of a naked singularity to distant\nobservers is actually excluded due to the formation of a new (and {\\it larger})\nhorizon around the original black hole. Moreover, we shall prove that this new\nhorizon is already formed {\\it before} the charged shell crosses the original\nblack-hole horizon.

Urban traffic gridlock is a familiar scene.\nRidesharing has the potential to solve many environmental, congestion, and\nenergy problems. In this paper, we introduce the problem of large scale\nreal-time ridesharing with service guarantee on road networks. Servers and trip\nrequests are dynamically matched while waiting time and service time\nconstraints of trips are satisfied. We first propose two basic algorithms: a\nbranch-and-bound algorithm and an integer programing algorithm. However, these\nalgorithm structures do not adapt well to the dynamic nature of the ridesharing\nproblem. Thus, we then propose a kinetic tree algorithm capable of better\nscheduling dynamic requests and adjusting routes on-the-fly. We perform\nexperiments on a large real taxi dataset from Shanghai. The results show that\nthe kinetic tree algorithm is faster than other algorithms in response time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Feb 2013 05:41:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-28"}

Also,\noccultation measurements provide important information on the planetary shape\nwhich is often not considered in structure models. In this paper we explore how\nwind velocities and internal rotation affect the planetary shape and the\nconstraints on Saturn's interior. We show that within the geodetic approach\n(Lindal et al., 1985, ApJ, 90, 1136) the derived physical shape is insensitive\nto the assumed deep rotation. Saturn's re-derived equatorial and polar radii at\n100 mbar are found to be 54,445 $\\pm$10 km and 60,365$\\pm$10 km, respectively.\nTo determine Saturn's interior we use {\\it 1 D} three-layer hydrostatic\nstructure models, and present two approaches to include the constraints on the\nshape. These approaches, however, result in only small differences in Saturn's\nderived composition. The uncertainty in Saturn's rotation period is more\nsignificant: with Voyager's 10h39mns period, the derived mass of heavy elements\nin the envelope is 0-7 M$_{\\oplus}$. With a rotation period of 10h32mns, this\nvalue becomes $<4$ $M_{\\oplus}$, below the minimum mass inferred from\nspectroscopic measurements. Saturn's core mass is found to depend strongly on\nthe pressure at which helium phase separation occurs, and is estimated to be\n5-20 M$_{\\oplus}$. Lower core masses are possible if the separation occurs\ndeeper than 4 Mbars. We suggest that the analysis of Cassini's radio\noccultation measurements is crucial to test shape models and could lead to\nconstraints on Saturn's rotation profile and departures from hydrostatic\nequilibrium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Feb 2013 07:59:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

Moreover, we show that inelastic scattering processes, which plague\nultrafast scattering in the far-field regime, do not contribute in ultrafast\nx-ray phase contrast imaging as a consequence of an interference effect. We\nillustrate our general findings by means of a wavepacket that lies in the time\nand energy range of the dynamics of valence electrons in complex molecular and\nbiological systems.

Our classification is\nbased on nine measures to quantify the social embeddedness of bug reporters in\nthe collaboration network.

For those projects that exhibit the lowest fraction of valid\nbug reports, we find that the bug reporters' position in the collaboration\nnetwork is a strong indicator for the quality of bug reports. Based on this\nfinding, we develop an automated classification scheme that can easily be\nintegrated into bug tracking platforms and analyze its performance in the\nconsidered OSS communities. A support vector machine (SVM) to identify valid\nbug reports based on the nine measures yields a precision of up to 90.3% with\nan associated recall of 38.9%. With this, we significantly improve the results\nobtained in previous case studies for an automated early identification of bugs\nthat are eventually fixed.

The central idea is to assign a probability\ndistribution on the set of all paths in a network. More precisely, a\nGibbs-Boltzmann distribution is defined over a bag of paths in a network, that\nis, on a representation that considers all paths independently. We show that,\nunder this distribution, the probability of drawing a path connecting two nodes\ncan easily be computed in closed form by simple matrix inversion. This\nprobability captures a notion of relatedness between nodes of the graph: two\nnodes are considered as highly related when they are connected by many,\npreferably low-cost, paths. As an application, two families of distances\nbetween nodes are derived from the BoP probabilities. Interestingly, the second\ndistance family interpolates between the shortest path distance and the\nresistance distance. In addition, it extends the Bellman-Ford formula for\ncomputing the shortest path distance in order to integrate sub-optimal paths by\nsimply replacing the minimum operator by the soft minimum operator.\nExperimental results on semi-supervised classification show that both of the\nnew distance families are competitive with other state-of-the-art approaches.\nIn addition to the distance measures studied in this paper, the bag-of-paths\nframework enables straightforward computation of many other relevant network\nmeasures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Feb 2013 13:41:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 29 Jun 2016 10:21:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 14 Dec 2016 08:47:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-30"}

Fisher and Muller proposed that\nrecombination provides an evolutionary advantage in large populations by\nalleviating this competition. Based on recent progress in quantifying the speed\nof adaptation in asexual populations undergoing clonal interference, we present\na detailed analysis of the Fisher-Muller mechanism for a model genome\nconsisting of two loci with an infinite number of beneficial alleles each and\nmultiplicative fitness effects. We solve the infinite population dynamics\nexactly and show that, for a particular, natural mutation scheme, the speed of\nadaptation in sexuals is twice as large as in asexuals. Guided by the infinite\npopulation result and by previous work on asexual adaptation, we postulate an\nexpression for the speed of adaptation in finite sexual populations that agrees\nwith numerical simulations over a wide range of population sizes and\nrecombination rates. The ratio of the sexual to asexual adaptation speed is a\nfunction of population size that increases in the clonal interference regime\nand approaches 2 for extremely large populations. The simulations also show\nthat the imbalance between the numbers of accumulated mutations at the two loci\nis strongly suppressed even by a small amount of recombination. The\ngeneralization of the model to an arbitrary number $L$ of loci is briefly\ndiscussed. If each offspring samples the alleles at each locus from the gene\npool of the whole population rather than from two parents, the ratio of the\nsexual to asexual adaptation speed is approximately equal to $L$ in large\npopulations.

To understand the\nphysical conditions during the early stages of high-mass star formation, it is\nnecessary to learn more about the physical conditions and stability in\nrelatively unevolved IRDCs.

The present paper shows that prior ignorance about three\nor more exclusive alternatives and the emergence of partially ordered beliefs\nwhen evidence is obtained defy representation by any single set of\ndistributions, but yield to a representation baud on several uts. The partial\norder is shown to be a partial qualitative probability which shares some\nintuitively appealing attributes with probability distributions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Feb 2013 14:19:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-28"}

From a\nmagnetohydrodynamical framework, the torus can be considered to be a particular\nregion of clouds surrounding the central engine where the clouds are dusty and\noptically thick. In this framework, the magnetic field plays an important role\nin the creation, morphology and evolution of the torus. If the dust grains\nwithin the clouds are assumed to be aligned by paramagnetic alignment, then the\nratio of the intrinsic polarisation and visual extinction, P(%)/Av, is a\nfunction of the magnetic field strength.\n  To estimate the visual extinction through the torus and constrain the\npolarisation mechanisms in the nucleus of AGN, we developed a polarisation\nmodel to fit both the total and polarised flux in a 1.2\" (~263pc) aperture of\nthe type 2 AGN, IC5063. The polarisation model is consistent with the nuclear\npolarisation observed at K being produced by dichroic absorption from aligned\ndust grains with a visual extinction through the torus of 48$\\pm$2 mag. We\nestimated the intrinsic polarisation arising from dichroic absorption to be\nP$_{K}^{dic}$=12.5$\\pm$2.7%.\n  We consider the physical conditions and environment of the gas and dust for\nthe torus of IC5063.

Alternatively, we estimate the magnetic field strength in\nthe plane of the sky using the Chandrasekhar-Fermi method. The minimum magnetic\nfield strength in the plane of the sky is estimated to be 13 and 41 mG\ndepending of the conditions within the torus of IC5063.

Traditional tactic languages, often based on stack-based\ngoal propagation, make it easy to write proofs that obscure the flow of goals\nbetween tactics and are fragile to minor changes in input, proof structure or\nchanges to tactics themselves. Here, we address this by introducing a graphical\nlanguage called PSGraph for writing proof strategies. Strategies are\nconstructed visually by \"wiring together\" collections of tactics and evaluated\nby propagating goal nodes through the diagram via graph rewriting. Tactic nodes\ncan have many output wires, and use a filtering procedure based on goal-types\n(predicates describing the features of a goal) to decide where best to send\nnewly-generated sub-goals.\n  In addition to making the flow of goal information explicit, the graphical\nlanguage can fulfil the role of many tacticals using visual idioms like\nbranching, merging, and feedback loops. We argue that this language enables\ndevelopment of more robust proof strategies and provide several examples, along\nwith a prototype implementation in Isabelle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Feb 2013 15:58:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Oct 2013 13:49:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-13"}

In Raman scattering if we set,\nfor example, incident and scattered light polarizations to two possible stripe\ndirections, we can observe the fluctuating stripe as if it is static. Using the\ndifferent symmetry selection rule between the B1g two-magnon scattering and the\nB1g and B2g isotropic electronic scattering, we succeeded to obtain the\nk\\parallel and k\\perp strip magnetic excitations separately in La2-xSrxCuO4.\nOnly the k\\perp stripe excitations appear in the wide-energy isotropic\nelectronic Raman scattering, indicating that the charge transfer is restricted\nto the direction perpendicular to the stripe. This is the same as the Burgers\nvector of an edge dislocation which easily slides perpendicularly to the\nstripe. Hence charges at the edge dislocation move together with the\ndislocation perpendicularly to the stripe, while other charges are localized. A\nlooped edge dislocation has lower energy than a single edge dislocation. The\nsuperconducting coherence length is close to the inter-charge stripe distance\nat x \\le 0.2. Therefore we conclude that Cooper pairs are formed at looped edge\ndislocations. The restricted charge transfer direction naturally explains the\nopening of a pseudogap around (0, {\\pi}) for the stripe parallel to the b axis\nand the reconstruction of the Fermi surface to have a flat plane near (0,\n{\\pi}). They break the four-fold rotational symmetry.
