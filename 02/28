While\nconventional equilibrium statistical mechanics is not useful for characterizing\ngranular materials, the idea of constructing a statistical ensemble analogous\nto its equilibrium counterpart to describe static granular matter was proposed\nby Edwards and Oakshott more than two decades ago. Recent years have seen\nseveral implementations of this idea. One of these is the stress ensemble,\nwhich is based on properties of the force moment tensor, and applies to\nfrictional and frictionless grains. We demonstrate the full utility of this\nstatistical framework in shear jammed (SJ) experimental states [1,2], a special\nclass of granular solids created by pure shear, which is a strictly\nnon-equilbrium protocol for creating solids. We demonstrate that the stress\nensemble provides an excellent quantitative description of fluctuations in\nexperimental SJ states. We show that the stress fluctuations are controlled by\na single tensorial quantity: the angoricity of the system, which is a direct\nanalog of the thermodynamic temperature. SJ states exhibit significant\ncorrelations in local stresses and are thus inherently different from\ndensity-driven, isotropically jammed (IJ) states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Feb 2013 16:01:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-18"}

(henceforth M12) recently reported, based on 14C data, an\nextreme cosmic event ca. AD775. Using a simple model, M12 claimed that the\nevent was too strong to be caused by a solar flare within the standard theory.\nThis implied a new paradigm of either an impossibly strong solar flare or a\nvery strong cosmic ray event of unknown origin occurred ca. AD775. We show that\nthe strength of the event was significantly overestimated by M12. Several\nsubsequent works have attempted to find a possible exotic source for such an\nevent, but they are all based on incorrect estimates by M12.

We surveyed available\nhistorical chronicles for astronomical observations for the AD770s to identify\npotential sightings of aurorae or supernovae. We interpreted the 14C\nmeasurements using an appropriate carbon cycle model. We show that: (1) The\nreality of the AD775 event is confirmed by new measurements of 14C; (2) by\nusing an inappropriate carbon cycle model, M12 strongly overestimated the\nevent's strength; (3) The revised magnitude of the event is consistent with\ndifferent independent datasets (14C, 10Be, 36Cl) and can be associated with a\nstrong, but not inexplicably strong, SEP event (or a sequence of events), and\nprovides the first evidence for an event of this magnitude (the fluence >30 MeV\nwas about 4.5*10^{10} /cm2) in multiple datasets; (4) This is in agreement with\nincreased auroral activity identified in historical chronicles.

We conclude\nthat the presence of the 1/q^2-term in the SVZ-expansion due to a tachyonic\ngluon mass appears naturally in the Minimum Soft Wall (MSW) and the\nGauge/String Dual (GSD) models which can also reproduce semi-quantitatively\nsome of the higher dimension condensate contributions appearing in the OPE. The\nHard-Wall model shows a large departure from the SVZ + 1/q^2 expansion in the\nvector, scalar and gluonium channels due to the absence of any power\ncorrections. The equivalence of the MSW and GSD models is manifest in the\nvector channel through the relation of the dilaton parameter with the tachyonic\ngluon mass. For approximately reproducing the phenomenological values of the\ndimension d=4,6 condensates, the holographic models require a tachyonic gluon\nmass (\\alpha_s/\\pi)\\lambda^2= -(0.12- 0.14) GeV^2, which is about twice the\nfitted phenomenological value from e^+e^- data. The relation of the inverse\nlength parameter c_i to the tachyonic gluon mass also shows that c_i is channel\ndependent but not universal for a given holographic model. Using the MSW model\nand M_\\rho=0.78 GeV as input, we predict a scalar \\bar qq mass M_S=(0.95-1.10)\nGeV and a scalar gluonium mass M_G= (1.1- 1.3) GeV.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Feb 2013 16:27:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 9 Mar 2013 06:04:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

A numerical analysis shows also\nthat the expected J2c^-2 range-rate signal for Juno should be as large as 280\nmicrons per second during a typical 6 h pass at its closest approach.\nIndependent analyses previously performed by other researchers about the\nmeasurability of the Lense-Thirring effect showed that the radio science\napparatus of Juno should reach an accuracy in Doppler range-rate measurements\nof 1-5 microns per second over such passes. The range-rate signature of the\nclassical even zonal perturbations is different from the 1PN one. Thus, further\ninvestigations, based on covariance analyses of simulated Doppler data and\ndedicated parameters estimation, are worth of further consideration.

We then present a new measure for unbiased detection of\nmulti-variable dependency, \"differential interaction information.\" This\nquantity for two variables reduces to the pairwise \"set complexity\" previously\nproposed as a context-dependent measure of information in biological systems.\nWe generalize it here to an arbitrary number of variables. Critical limiting\nproperties of the \"differential interaction information\" are key to the\ngeneralization. This measure extends previous ideas about biological\ninformation and provides a more sophisticated basis for study of complexity.\nThe properties of \"differential interaction information\" also suggest new\napproaches to data analysis. Given a data set of system measurements\ndifferential interaction information can provide a measure of collective\ndependence, which can be represented in hypergraphs describing complex system\ninteraction patterns. We investigate this kind of analysis using simulated data\nsets. The conjoining of a generalized set complexity measure, multi-variable\ndependency analysis, and hypergraphs is our central result. While our focus is\non complex biological systems, our results are applicable to any complex\nsystem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Feb 2013 17:30:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 Mar 2013 15:58:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 19 Aug 2013 23:13:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-21"}

The speed c appearing in\nMaxwell's wave equations was the speed of light with respect to the ether.\nTherefore, according to the Galilean addition of velocities, the speed of light\nin the laboratory would differ from c. The measure of such difference would\nreveal the motion of the laboratory (the Earth) relative to the ether (a sort\nof absolute motion). However the Earth's absolute motion was never evidenced.\n  Galileo addition of velocities is based on the assumption that lengths and\ntime intervals are invariant (independent of the state of motion). This way of\nthinking the spacetime emanates from our daily experience and lies at the heart\nof Newton's Classical Mechanics. Nevertheless, in 1905 Einstein defied Galileo\naddition of velocities by postulating that light travels at the same speed c in\nany inertial frame. In doing so, Einstein extended the principle of relativity\nto the electromagnetic phenomena described by Maxwell's laws. In Einstein's\nSpecial Relativity the ether does not exist and the absolute motion is devoid\nof meaning. The invariance of the speed of light forced the replacement of\nGalileo transformations with Lorentz transformations. Thus, relativistic length\ncontractions and time dilations entered our understanding of the spacetime.\nNewtonian mechanics had to be reformulated, which led to the discovery of the\nmass-energy equivalence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Feb 2013 19:21:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

The solar\nabundances from oxygen to atomic mass 90 are fit quite well assuming no cut-off\nat all, i.e., by assuming all stars up to 120 solar masses make successful\nsupernovae. Little degradation in the fit occurs if the upper limit is reduced\nto 25 solar masses. The limit can be further reduced, but the required event\nrate of supernovae in the remaining range rises rapidly to compensate for the\nlost nucleosynthesis of the more massive stars. The nucleosynthesis of the\ns-process declines precipitously and the production of species made in the\nwinds, e.g., carbon, becomes unacceptably large compared with elements made in\nthe explosion, e.g., silicon and oxygen. However, by varying uncertain physics,\nespecially the mass loss rate for massive stars and the rate for the neon-22 to\nmagnesium-25 reaction rate, acceptable nucleosynthesis might still be achieved\nwith a cutoff as low as 18 solar masses.

In this article, we consider a toy version of this difficult\nproblem by analyzing the von Neumann entropy of stabilizer states. We find that\nthe von Neumann entropy of stabilizer states satisfies all balanced information\ninequalities that hold in the classical case. Our argument is built on the fact\nthat stabilizer states have a classical model, provided by the discrete Wigner\nfunction: The phase-space entropy of the Wigner function corresponds directly\nto the von Neumann entropy of the state, which allows us to reduce to the\nclassical case.

Past work\nhas focused on designing the network to support all hose matrices (all matrices\nnot exceeding marginal bounds at the nodes). This model may be too conservative\nif additional information on traffic patterns is available. Another extreme is\nthe fixed demand model, where one designs the network to support peak\npoint-to-point demands. We introduce a capped hose model to explore a broader\nrange of traffic matrices which includes the above two as special cases. It is\nknown that optimal designs for the hose model are always determined by\nsingle-hub routing, and for the fixed- demand model are based on shortest-path\nrouting. We shed light on the wider space of capped hose matrices in order to\nsee which traffic models are more shortest path-like as opposed to hub-like. To\naddress the space in between, we use hierarchical multi-hub routing templates,\na generalization of hub and tree routing. In particular, we show that by adding\npeak capacities into the hose model, the single-hub tree-routing template is no\nlonger cost-effective. This initiates the study of a class of robust network\ndesign (RND) problems restricted to these templates. Our empirical analysis is\nbased on a heuristic for this new hierarchical RND problem. We also propose\nthat it is possible to define a routing indicator that accounts for the\nstrengths of the marginals and peak demands and use this information to choose\nthe appropriate routing template. We benchmark our approach against other\nwell-known routing templates, using representative carrier networks and a\nvariety of different capped hose traffic demands, parameterized by the relative\nimportance of their marginals as opposed to their point-to-point peak demands.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Feb 2013 23:25:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-01"}

Methods: Using our 3D Monte Carlo Lya radiation transfer code, we\nstudy the radiative transfer of Lya, UV and optical continuum photons in\nhomogeneous and clumpy shells of neutral hydrogen and dust surrounding a\ncentral source. Our simulations predict the Lya and continuum escape fraction,\nthe Lya equivalent width EW(Lya), the Lya line profile and their dependence on\nthe gas geometry and the main input physical parameters. Results: The ISM\nclumpiness is found to have a strong impact on the Lya line radiative transfer,\nentailing a strong dependence of the emergent features of the Lya line (escape\nfraction, EW(Lya)) on the ISM morphology. Although a clumpy and dusty ISM\nappears more transparent to radiation (both line and continuum) compared to an\nequivalent homogeneous ISM of equal dust optical depth, we find that the Lya\nphotons are, in general, still more attenuated than UV continuum radiation. As\na consequence, the observed Lya equivalent width (EWobs(Lya)) is lower than the\nintrinsic one (EWint(Lya)) for nearly all clumpy ISM configurations considered.\nThere are, however, special conditions under which Lya photons escape more\neasily than the continuum, resulting in an enhanced EWobs(Lya). The requirement\nfor this to happen is that the ISM is almost static (galactic outflows < 200\nkm/s), extremely clumpy (with density contrasts >10^7 in HI between clumps and\nthe interclump medium), and very dusty (E(B-V) > 0.30). When these conditions\nare fulfilled the emergent Lya line profile shows no velocity shift and little\nasymmetry. Given the asymmetry and velocity shifts generally observed in\nstarburst galaxies with Lya emission, we conclude that clumping is unlikely to\nsignificantly enhance their relative Lya/UV transmission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Feb 2013 00:29:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 May 2013 19:24:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

More generally, optimized chromatic aberration will allow to\nsimultaneously focus on several objects located at different distances and\nemitting or reflecting at different frequencies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Feb 2013 02:13:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-01"}

We finally show that ideal memristors, namely those whose state\ndepends only on the charge that flows through them (or on the history of the\nvoltage) are subject to very strict physical conditions and are unable to\nprotect their memory state against the unavoidable fluctuations, and therefore\nare susceptible to a stochastic catastrophe.

The present work specifically focuses onto random quantities lying in\na high dimensional stochastic space in the context of limited amount of\ninformation. The proposed approach involves a procedure for the selection of an\napproximation basis and the evaluation of the associated coefficients. The\nselection of the approximation basis relies on the a priori choice of the\nHigh-Dimensional Model Representation format combined with a modified Least\nAngle Regression technique. The resulting basis then provides the structure for\nthe actual approximation basis, possibly using different functions, more\nparsimonious and nonlinear in its coefficients. To evaluate the coefficients,\nboth an alternate least squares and an alternate weighted total least squares\nmethods are employed. Examples are provided for the approximation of a random\nvariable in a high-dimensional space as well as the estimation of a random\nfield. Stochastic dimensions up to 100 are considered, with an amount of\ninformation as low as about 3 samples per dimension, and robustness of the\napproximation is demonstrated w.r.t. noise in the dataset. The computational\ncost of the solution method is shown to scale only linearly with the\ncardinality of the a priori basis and exhibits a (N_q)^s, 2 <= s <= 3,\ndependence with the number N_q of samples in the dataset.

In real world applications, these models provide us\nwith the means of organizing what would otherwise be unstructured collections.\nThey can help us cluster a huge collection into different topics or find a\nsubset of the collection that resembles the topical theme found in an article\nat hand.\n  The first wave of topic models developed were able to discover the prevailing\ntopics in a big collection of documents spanning a period of time. It was later\nrealized that these time-invariant models were not capable of modeling 1) the\ntime varying number of topics they discover and 2) the time changing structure\nof these topics. Few models were developed to address this two deficiencies.\nThe online-hierarchical Dirichlet process models the documents with a time\nvarying number of topics. It varies the structure of the topics over time as\nwell. However, it relies on document order, not timestamps to evolve the model\nover time. The continuous-time dynamic topic model evolves topic structure in\ncontinuous-time. However, it uses a fixed number of topics over time.\n  In this dissertation, I present a model, the continuous-time infinite dynamic\ntopic model, that combines the advantages of these two models 1) the\nonline-hierarchical Dirichlet process, and 2) the continuous-time dynamic topic\nmodel. More specifically, the model I present is a probabilistic topic model\nthat does the following: 1) it changes the number of topics over continuous\ntime, and 2) it changes the topic structure over continuous-time.\n  I compared the model I developed with the two other models with different\nsetting values. The results obtained were favorable to my model and showed the\nneed for having a model that has a continuous-time varying number of topics and\ntopic structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Feb 2013 05:30:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-06"}

Recently, a novel method of determining the\nLDMD from stellar distribution and vertical velocity dispersion profiles\nperpendicular to the Galactic plane was devised. This method has the advantage\nof abolishing conventional approximations and using only a few assumptions. Our\naims are to carefully scrutinize this method and to examine influences by\nuncertainties of astrometric observations. We discuss how the determinations of\nthe LDMD vary with observational precisions on parallax, proper motion, and\nline-of-sight velocity measurements. To examine the influences by the\nobservational imprecision, we created mock observation data for stars that are\ndynamical tracers based on an analytical galaxy model and applied parametrized\nobservational errors to the mock data. We evaluated the accuracy of determining\nthe LDMD by applying the method to the mock data. In addition, we estimated a\nsample size and observational precision required to determine the LDMD with\naccuracy. We find that the method is capable of determining the LDMD with\naccuracy if the sample size and observational precisions are satisfactory. The\nrandom errors of parallaxes and proper motions can cause systematic\noverestimation of the LDMD. We estimate the required precisions of the parallax\nmeasurements to be approximately 0.1-0.3 milliarcseconds at 1 kpc away from the\nSun; the proper motion precisions do not seem to be as important as the\nparallaxes. From these results, we expect that using the Hipparcos catalog\nwould overestimate the LDMD because of the imprecise parallax measurements if\nthis method is applied; however, we emphasize the capability of the method. We\nexpect that Gaia will provide data precise enough to determine the LDMD.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Feb 2013 06:46:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 10 May 2013 07:18:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

The duration of the acceleration phase\nis related to the duration of the rise phase of a flare. We investigate CMEs\nassociated with slow long duration events (LDEs), i.e. flares with the long\nrising phase. We determined the relationships between flares and CMEs and\nanalyzed the CME kinematics in detail. The parameters of the flares (GOES flux,\nduration of the rising phase) show strong correlations with the CME parameters\n(velocity, acceleration during main acceleration phase and duration of the CME\nacceleration phase). These correlations confirm the strong relation between\nslow LDEs and CMEs. We also analyzed the relation between the parameters of the\nCMEs, i.e. a velocity, an acceleration during the main acceleration phase, a\nduration of the acceleration phase, and a height of a CME at the end of the\nacceleration phase. The CMEs associated with the slow LDEs are characterized by\nhigh velocity during the propagation phase, with the median equal 1423 km/s. In\nhalf of the analyzed cases, the main acceleration was low (a<300 m/s^2), which\nsuggests that the high velocity is caused by the prolongated acceleration phase\n(the median for the duration of the acceleration phase is equal 90 minutes).\nThe CMEs were accelerated up to several solar radii (with the median 7 Rsun),\nwhich is much higher than in typical impulsive CMEs. Therefore, slow LDEs may\npotentially precede extremely strong geomagnetic storms.

We show that this\ndamping is responsible for the fusion hindrance phenomena measured in the deep\nsub-barrier fusion reactions. To show those, we for the first time apply the\nrandom-phase-approximation (RPA) method to the two-body $^{16}$O + $^{16}$O and\n$^{40}$Ca + $^{40}$Ca systems. We calculate the octupole transition strengths\nfor the two nuclei adiabatically approaching each other. The calculated\ntransition strength drastically decreases near the touching point, strongly\nsuggesting the vanishing of the quantum couplings between the relative motion\nand the vibrational intrinsic degrees of freedom of each nucleus. Based on this\npicture, we also calculate the fusion cross section for the $^{40}$Ca +\n$^{40}$Ca system using the coupled-channel method with the damping factor\nsimulating the vanishing of the couplings.

Investigation of its orbital evolution is conducted by\nusing the Mercury subroutine package, where the gravitational perturbations of\neight major planets in the Solar System are considered. Over very short time\nscales (~300 kyr) relative to the Solar System life time (~10 Gyr), the\nasteroid 4179 Toutatis gave an example of chaotic motion that can cause\nasteroid to move outward and may be followed by escaping from the Solar System.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Feb 2013 10:09:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-01"}

The probability that the ratio (|{\\omega}\n\\dot U|/|{\\omega}|^2) is higher than a given threshold is higher in the\nunfiltered isotropic field than in the fields where the large scales were\nfiltered out and is lower than in the fields were the small inertial and\ndissipative scales are filtered out.

We model the number and properties of ultracompact X-ray\nbinaries (UCXBs) in the Galactic Bulge.

The binary population synthesis code SeBa and\nstellar evolutionary tracks are used to model the UCXB population. The\nluminosity behavior of UCXBs is predicted using long-term X-ray observations of\nthe known UCXBs and the thermal-viscous disk instability model. Results. In our\nmodel, the majority of UCXBs initially have a helium burning star donor. In the\nabsence of a mechanism that destroys old UCXBs, we predict (0.2 - 1.9) x 10^5\nUCXBs in the Galactic Bulge, mostly at orbital periods longer than 60 min (a\nlarge number of long-period systems also follows from the observed short-period\nUCXB population). About 5 - 50 UCXBs should be brighter than 10^35 erg/s,\nmostly persistent sources with orbital periods shorter than 30 min and with\ndegenerate helium and carbon-oxygen donors. This is one order of magnitude more\nthan the observed number of (probably) three. Conclusions. This overprediction\nof short-period UCXBs implies that fewer systems are formed, or that a\nsuper-Eddington mass transfer rate is more difficult to survive than assumed.\nThe very small number of observed long-period UCXBs with respect to\nshort-period UCXBs, the surprisingly high luminosity of the observed UCXBs with\norbital periods around 50 min, and the properties of the PSR J1719-1438 system\nall point to much faster UCXB evolution than expected from angular momentum\nloss via gravitational wave radiation alone. Old UCXBs, if they still exist,\nprobably have orbital periods longer than 2 h and have become very faint due to\neither reduced accretion or quiescence, or have become detached. UCXBs are\npromising candidate progenitors of isolated millisecond radio pulsars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Feb 2013 13:01:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-27"}

To date there has been no conclusive explanation of the processes\ninvolved in the formation of these fossils. Microbial mats behave like\nviscoelastic fluids. We propose that the key mechanism involved in the\nformation of Kinneyia is a Kelvin-Helmholtz type instability induced in a\nviscoelastic film under flowing water. A ripple corrugation is spontaneously\ninduced in the film and grows in amplitude over time. Theoretical predictions\nshow that the ripple instability has a wavelength proportional to the thickness\nof the film. Experiments carried out using viscoelastic films confirm this\nprediction. The ripple pattern that forms has a wavelength roughly three times\nthe thickness of the film. This behaviour is independent of the viscosity of\nthe film and the flow conditions. Laboratory-analogue Kinneyia were formed via\nthe sedimentation of glass beads, which preferentially deposit in the troughs\nof the ripples. Well-ordered patterns form, with both honeycomb-like and\nparallel ridges being observed, depending on the flow speed. These patterns\ncorrespond well with those found in Kinneyia, with similar morphologies,\nwavelengths and amplitudes being observed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Feb 2013 13:11:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-25"}

The\ntimescale on which quasi-static speckles evolve, is determined by various\nfactors, among others mechanical or thermal deformations. Understanding of\nthese time-variable instrumental speckles, and especially their interaction\nwith other aberrations, referred to as the pinning effect, is paramount for the\nsearch of faint stellar companions. The temporal evolution of quasi-static\nspeckles is for instance required for a quantification of the gain expected\nwhen using angular differential imaging (ADI), and to determine the interval on\nwhich speckle nulling techniques must be carried out. Following an early\nanalysis of a time series of adaptively corrected, coronagraphic images\nobtained in a laboratory condition with the High-Order Test bench (HOT) at ESO\nHeadquarters, we confirm our results with new measurements carried out with the\nSPHERE instrument during its final test phase in Europe.
