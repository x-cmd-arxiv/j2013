The Born rule for measurement equates the probability for a\ngiven outcome with the absolute square of the coefficient of the basis state,\nwhich by design removes the relative phase from the formulation. The value of\nthis phase at the moment of measurement naturally averages out in an ensemble,\nwhich would prevent any dependence from being observed, and we show that\nconventional frequency-spectroscopy measurements on discrete quantum systems\ncannot be imposed at a specific phase due to a straightforward uncertainty\nrelation. We lay out general conditions for imposing measurements at a specific\nvalue of the relative phase so that the possibility of its role as a hidden\nvariable can be tested, and we discuss implementation for the specific case of\nan atomic two-state system with laser-induced fluorescence for measurement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Feb 2013 16:03:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-18"}

This method is appreciated for its simplicity,\nrobustness, and efficiency. In the \"push\" protocol, every informed node\nselects, at every time step (a.k.a. round), one of its neighboring node\nuniformly at random and forwards the information to this node. This protocol is\nknown to complete information spreading in $O(\\log n)$ time steps with high\nprobability (w.h.p.) in several families of $n$-node \"static\" networks. The\nPush protocol has also been empirically shown to perform well in practice, and,\nspecifically, to be robust against dynamic topological changes.\n  In this paper, we aim at analyzing the Push protocol in \"dynamic\" networks.\nWe consider the \"edge-Markovian\" evolving graph model which captures natural\ntemporal dependencies between the structure of the network at time $t$, and the\none at time $t+1$. Precisely, a non-edge appears with probability $p$, while an\nexisting edge dies with probability $q$. In order to fit with real-world\ntraces, we mostly concentrate our study on the case where $p=\\Omega(1/n)$ and\n$q$ is constant.

These results suggest that the linear approximation is likely to be\ninappropriate to model systems with strong electron-phonon coupling, at least\nfor low carrier concentrations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Feb 2013 18:41:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 12 Jun 2013 00:12:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-13"}

In other words, there exists a\nshuffle of $k$-copies of $x$ which produces $x$. We are particularly interested\nin the case $k=2$, in which case we say $x$ is self-shuffling. This property of\ninfinite words is shown to be an intrinsic property of the word and not of its\nlanguage (set of factors). For instance, every aperiodic word contains a non\nself-shuffling word in its shift orbit closure. While the property of being\nself-shuffling is a relatively strong condition, many important words arising\nin the area of symbolic dynamics are verified to be self-shuffling. They\ninclude for instance the Thue-Morse word and all Sturmian words of intercept\n$0<\\rho <1$ (while those of intercept $\\rho=0$ are not self-shuffling). Our\ncharacterization of self-shuffling Sturmian words can be interpreted\narithmetically in terms of a dynamical embedding and defines an arithmetic\nprocess we call the {\\it stepping stone model}. One important feature of\nself-shuffling words stems from its morphic invariance, which provides a useful\ntool for showing that one word is not the morphic image of another. The notion\nof self-shuffling has other unexpected applications particularly in the area of\nsubstitutive dynamical systems. For example, as a consequence of our\ncharacterization of self-shuffling Sturmian words, we recover a number\ntheoretic result, originally due to Yasutomi, on a classification of pure\nmorphic Sturmian words in the orbit of the characteristic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Feb 2013 18:42:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 24 Nov 2013 18:34:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 14 Nov 2014 13:38:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-17"}

However, no\nhomogeneous database of star-forming galaxies is available in the NIR to fully\nexplore these results. With this in mind, we study the NIR spectra of a sample\nof 23 HII and starburst galaxies, aimed at characterizing the most prominent\nspectral features and continuum shape in the 0.8-2.4 micron region of these\nobjects. Spectral indices are derived for the relevant absorption lines/bands\nand a comparison with optical indices of the same sample available in the\nliterature is made. We found no correlation between the optical and the NIR\nindexes. This is probably due to the differences in aperture between these two\nsets of data. That result is further supported by the absence or weakness of\nemission lines in the NIR for a subsample galaxies, while in the optical the\nemission lines are strong and clear, which means that the ionisation source in\nmany of these galaxies is not nuclear, but circumnuclear or located in hot\nspots.

However, the effect of the musculature of the\nneck has yet to be investigated. Through measurements of the flexibility of the\nostrich neck after cumulative tissue removal, analyses of the muscle attachment\nsites of the ostrich and sauropods, and testing of the Osteological Neutral\nPose model, this study attempts to rectify this situation. The ostrich neck was\nshown to have three sections of flexibility; a slightly flexible anterior\nsection, a very flexible middle section and a stiff posterior section. The\nOsteological Neutral Pose did not show these sections, and was shown to\npotentially overestimate and underestimate flexibility. It was also found that\nthe inter-vertebral space could account for varying estimates of flexibility,\nand that sauropods would have proportionally more muscle mass at the base of\nthe neck in relation to the ostrich. Ultimately, it was shown that the tissues\nof the neck place the limits of flexibility, and that zygapophyseal overlap\ndoes not indicate the flexibility of the neck. Should the Osteological Neutral\nPose affect sauropod flexibility estimates in the same manner as that of the\nostrich (a general overestimate), then the sauropods would have a more limited\nfeeding envelope than previously thought, allowing for greater niche\npartitioning between groups.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Feb 2013 20:08:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-18"}

This encouraged\na greater investment in new types of game controllers such as the WiiMote, Rock\nBand instruments and the Kinect. However, the native software of these\ncontrollers was not originally designed to be used in other game applications.\nThis work addresses this issue by building a middleware framework, which maps\nbody poses or voice commands to actions in any game. This not only warrants a\nmore natural and customized user-experience but it also defines an\ninteroperable virtual controller. In this version of the framework, body poses\nand voice commands are respectively recognized through the Kinect's built-in\ncameras and microphones. The acquired data is then translated into the native\ninteraction scheme in real time using a lightweight method based on spatial\nrestrictions. The system is also prepared to use Nintendo's Wiimote as an\nauxiliary and unobtrusive gamepad for physically or verbally impractical\ncommands. System validation was performed by analyzing the performance of\ncertain tasks and examining user reports. Both confirmed this approach as a\npractical and alluring alternative to the game's native interaction scheme. In\nsum, this framework provides a game-controlling tool that is totally\ncustomizable and very flexible, thus expanding the market of game consumers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Feb 2013 20:18:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-18"}

Our spectrum, obtained with the Infrared\nSpectrograph onboard the Spitzer Space Telescope, reveals a 15.2 micron CO2 ice\nbending mode profile that cannot modeled with the same ice structure typically\nfound toward other protostars. We develop a modified CO2 ice profile\ndecomposition, including the addition of new high-quality laboratory spectra of\npure, crystalline CO2 ice. Using this model, we find that 87-92% of the CO2 is\nsequestered as spherical, CO2-rich mantles, while typical interstellar ices\nshow evidence of irregularly-shaped, hydrogen-rich mantles.

The mechanism responsible for the sublimation could be\neither a transient accretion event or shocks in the interaction region between\nthe protostellar outflow and envelope.

Its main features are an intuitive\nmathematical interface, a high degree of automation, and an efficient\nimplementation of the generated adjoint model. The framework is based upon the\nextension of a domain-specific language for variational problems to cleanly\nexpress complex optimisation problems in a compact, high-level syntax. For\nexample, optimisation problems constrained by the time-dependent Navier-Stokes\nequations can be written in tens of lines of code. Based on this high-level\nrepresentation, the framework derives the associated adjoint equations in the\nsame domain-specific language, and uses the FEniCS code generation technology\nto emit parallel optimised low-level C++ code for the solution of the forward\nand adjoint systems. The functional and gradient information so computed is\nthen passed to the optimisation algorithm to update the parameter values. This\napproach works both for steady-state as well as transient, and for linear as\nwell as nonlinear governing PDEs and a wide range of functionals and control\nparameters.

Our combined image of the interferometer and single-dish data depicts\ndetailed structures of the dense envelope within the core. We found that the\ncore has a radial density profile of n(r) prop. r^-p and a reliable difference\nin the power-law indices between the outer and inner regions of the core: p~2\nfor r >= 4000 AU and p ~ 1.5 for r <= 4000 AU}. The dense core shows a slight\noverall velocity gradient of ~1.0 km s^-1 over the scale of 20,000 AU across\nthe outflow axis. We believe that this velocity gradient represents a\nsolid-body-like rotation of the core. The dense envelope has a quite\nsymmetrical velocity structure with a remarkable line broadening toward the\ncore center, which is especially prominent in the position-velocity diagram\nacross the outflow axis.

Their particular strength lies in the multi-TeV to ultra high\nenergy range (E > 30 TeV), where large effective areas, yet small light\nsensitive areas per detector station are needed. To exploit this potential to\nfull extent, a large station spacing is required to achieve a large effective\narea at a reasonable effort. In such a detector, the low number of signals per\nevent, the absence of imaging information, and the poor signal to noise ratio\nof Cherenkov light to night sky brightness pose considerable challenges for the\nevent reconstruction, especially the gamma hadron separation. The event\nreconstruction presented in this paper has been developed for the wide-angle\ndetector HiSCORE, but the concepts may be applied more generically. It is\ntested on simulated data in the 10 TeV to 5 PeV energy range. For the tests, a\nregular grid of 22 x 22 detector stations with a spacing of 150 m is assumed,\ncovering an area of 10 km^2. The angular resolution of individual events is\nfound to be about 0.3 degree near the energy threshold, improving to below 0.1\ndegree at higher energies. The relative energy resolution is 20% at the\nthreshold and improves to 10% at higher energies. Several parameters for gamma\nhadron separation are described. With a combination of these parameters, 80% to\n90% of the hadronic background can be suppressed, while about 60% of the\ngamma-ray events are retained. The point source sensitivity to gamma-ray\nsources is estimated, with conservative assumptions, to be about 8 x 10^(-13)\nerg / s / cm^2 at 100 TeV gamma-ray for a 10 km^2 array. With more optimistic\nassumptions, and a 100 km^2 array, a sensitivity of about 1 x 10^(-13) erg / s\n/ cm^2 can be achieved (at 100 TeV).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Feb 2013 11:26:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

The system endeavors to provide a good trade-off\nbetween robustness, energy efficiency and high data rate, while still being\nsimple compared to conventional multi-carrier spread spectrum systems. This\nsystem can be seen as a parallel extension of the DCSK modulation where one\nchaotic reference sequence is transmitted over a predefined subcarrier\nfrequency. Multiple modulated data streams are transmitted over the remaining\nsubcarriers. This transmitter structure increases the spectral efficiency of\nthe conventional DCSK system and uses less energy. The receiver design makes\nthis system easy to implement where no radio frequency (RF) delay circuit is\nneeded to demodulate received data. Various system design parameters are\ndiscussed throughout the paper, including the number of subcarriers, the\nspreading factor, and the transmitted energy. Once the design is explained, the\nbit error rate performance of the MC-DCSK system is computed and compared to\nthe conventional DCSK system under an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and\nRayleigh channels. Simulation results confirm the advantages of this new hybrid\ndesign.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Feb 2013 19:00:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Mar 2013 01:14:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 26 Mar 2013 02:57:58 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 26 Jun 2013 16:24:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}
