Convergence\nanalysis of the algorithm is presented. Our approach is to obtain a sequence of\noptimization problems by successively approximating the l0-norm and to solve\nresulting problems by exploiting the proximity operator. We examine the\nperformance of our proposed algorithm and compare it with the binary iterative\nhard thresholding (BIHT) [10] a state-of-the-art algorithm for 1-bit\ncompressive sampling reconstruction.

Two initial entangled states of the system are\nexamined, namely the GHZ- and W-type states. The dynamics of quantum\ncorrelations results to be strongly affected by the input configuration of the\nqubits, the type of the system-environment interaction, and the memory\nproperties of the environmental noise. When the qubits are non-locally coupled\nto the random telegraph noise, the GHZ-type states partially preserve, at long\ntimes, both discord and entanglement, regardless the correlation time of the\nenvironmental noise. The survived entangled states turn out to be also\ndetectable by means of suitable entanglement witnesses. On the other hand, in\nthe same conditions, the decohering effects suppress all the quantum\ncorrelation of the W-type states which are thus less robust than the GHZ-type\nones. The long-time survival of tripartite discord and entanglement opens\ninteresting perspectives in the use of multipartite entangled states for\npractical applications in quantum information science.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Feb 2013 16:39:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-11"}

Full-disc magnetograms and\nintensity images by the HMI instrument onboard SDO were employed. Bright\nmagnetic features, representing network and faculae, were identified and the\nrelationship between their intensity contrast at continuum and line core with\nmagnetogram signal and heliocentric angle examined. Care was taken to minimize\nthe inclusion of the magnetic canopy and straylight from sunspots and pores as\nnetwork and faculae. In line with earlier studies, network features, on a per\nunit magnetic flux basis, appeared brighter than facular features. Intensity\ncontrasts in the continuum and line core differ considerably, most notably,\nthey exhibit opposite centre-to-limb variations. We found this difference in\nbehaviour to likely be due to the different mechanisms of the formation of the\ntwo spectral components. From a simple model based on bivariate polynomial fits\nto the measured contrasts we confirmed spectral line changes to be a\nsignificant driver of facular contribution to variation in solar irradiance.\nThe discrepancy between the continuum contrast reported here and in the\nliterature was shown to arise mainly from differences in spatial resolution and\ntreatment of magnetic signals adjacent to sunspots and pores. HMI is a source\nof accurate contrasts and low-noise magnetograms covering the full solar disc.\nFor irradiance studies it is important to consider not just the contribution\nfrom the continuum but also from the spectral lines. In order not to\nunderestimate long-term variations in solar irradiance, irradiance models\nshould take the greater contrast per unit magnetic flux associated with\nmagnetic features with low magnetic flux into account.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Feb 2013 17:21:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-17"}

We then apply this procedure to simulations of reduced MHD turbulence\nand perform a statistical analysis on the obtained population of current\nsheets. We evaluate the role of reconnection by separately studying the\npopulations of current sheets which contain magnetic X-points and those which\ndo not.

We assume further that the external electromagnetic field can be\ndecomposed into two parts: a deterministic (or coherent) part and a randomly\nfluctuating chaotic component, which is a \\delta-correlated, Gaussian, Markov\nand stationary process (white noise). This assumption corresponds to the case\nof the real multimode laser operating without any correlation between the\nmodes. We solve a set of coupled stochastic integro-differential equations\ninvolving the Fano model with two discrete levels. We derive an exact formula\nby determining the photoelectron spectrum and compare it with the results\nobtained in our previous papers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Feb 2013 19:18:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-07"}

Evidence comes\nfrom power spectrum analysis of palaeoclimate records and from inspection of\nthe timing of glacial and deglacial transitions. However, we do not know how\ntight this control is. Is it, for example, conceivable that random climatic\nfluctuations could cause a delay in deglaciation, bad enough to skip a full\nprecession or obliquity cycle and subsequently modify the sequence of ice ages?\n  To address this question, seven previously published conceptual models of ice\nages are analysed by reference to the notion of generalised synchronisation.\nInsight is being gained by comparing the effects of the astronomical forcing\nwith idealised forcings composed of only one or two periodic components. In\ngeneral, the richness of the astronomical forcing allows for synchronisation\nover a wider range of parameters, compared to periodic forcing. Hence, glacial\ncycles may conceivably have remained paced by the astronomical forcing\nthroughout the Pleistocene.\n  However, all the models examined here also show a range of parameters for\nwhich the structural stability of the ice age dynamics is weak. This means that\nsmall variations in parameters or random fluctuations may cause significant\nshifts in the succession of ice ages if the system were effectively in that\nparameter range. Whether or not the system has strong structural stability\ndepends on the amplitude of the effects associated with the astronomical\nforcing, which significantly differ across the different models studied here.\nThe possibility of synchronisation on eccentricity is also discussed and it is\nshown that a high Rayleigh number on eccentricity, as recently found in\nobservations, is no guarantee of reliable synchronisation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Feb 2013 19:49:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

The electronic spectral function for such a system\npredicts a narrow Kondo resonance close to Fermi energy below its Kondo\ntemperature 'TK'. The internal energy level structure of the localized magnetic\nmoment introduces sidebands near the Kondo resonance, each with its respective\nKondo temperature increasing as the sideband position moves towards higher\nbinding energies. Consequently, the temperature dependence of the resonance\nfeatures becomes weaker as we go towards higher binding energies. Here, we show\na Ce4f photoemission spectral evolution obtained from a prototypical Kondo\nsystem CeAl2, departing from the predictions of the spectral function. Our\nmeasurements reveal a uniform temperature dependence for all the well screened\nCe4f photoemission features (4f1 final state), which are usually interpreted as\nresonance features, as we reduce the temperature suggesting that the resonance\ninterpretation for the 4f1 final state features is not appropriate. Instead,\nthe spectral evolution is explained simply by the temperature dependence of the\nstrength of the coupling between Ce4f and valence electrons, which remains\nuniform over the range of 4f1 final state features.

How thin this light sheet exactly is, however, is often unknown.\nParticularly in the popular objective-type total internal reflection\nfluorescence microscopy (TIRFM) configuration large deviations from the\nexpected exponential intensity decay of the evanescent wave have been reported.\nPropagating, i.e., non-evanescent, excitation light diminishes the optical\nsectioning effect, reduces contrast and renders the quantification of TIRFM\nimages uncertain. Here, we use a combination of azimuthal- and polar-angle beam\nscanning, dark-field scatter imaging, and atomic force microscopy to identify\nthe sources of this unwanted background fluorescence excitation. We identify\nstray light originating from the microscope optics and the objective lens\nitself as the major sources of background, with minor contributions due to\nevanescent-wave scattering at the reflecting interface and at refractive-index\nboundaries in the sample. Apart from evanescence in excitation light, light\nemitted from a fluorophore can also show observable effects of evanescence.\nOnly fluorophores located close to the coverslip can couple their near-field\nradiation into propagating waves detectable at supercritical angles. We show\nthat selectively detecting this supercritical-angle fluorescence (SAF) through\na high-numerical aperture objective effectively rejects fluorescence from\ndeeper sample regions and improves optical sectioning. The microscopy scheme\npresented here merges the benefits of TIRF excitation and SAF detection and\nprovides the conditions for quantitative wide-field imaging of fluorophore\ndynamics at or near the plasma membrane.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Feb 2013 23:33:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-08"}

First,\nwe derive an equivalent Kalman filter for sensor selection, i.e., generalized\ninformation filter. Then, under a regularity condition, we prove that the\nmultistage look-ahead policy that minimizes either the final or the average\nestimation error covariances of next multiple time steps is equivalent to a\nmyopic sensor selection policy that maximizes the trace of the generalized\ninformation gain at each time step. Moreover, when the measurement noises are\nuncorrelated between sensors, the optimal solution can be obtained analytically\nfor sensor selection when constraints are temporally separable. When\nconstraints are temporally inseparable, sensor selections can be obtained by\napproximately solving a linear programming problem so that the sensor selection\nproblem for a large sensor network can be dealt with quickly. Although there is\nno guarantee that the gap between the performance of the chosen subset and the\nperformance bound is always small, numerical examples suggest that the\nalgorithm is near-optimal in many cases. Finally, when the measurement noises\nare correlated between sensors, the sensor selection problem with temporally\ninseparable constraints can be relaxed to a Boolean quadratic programming\nproblem which can be efficiently solved by a Gaussian randomization procedure\nalong with solving a semi-definite programming problem.

We explore gravitational interactions with\na distant planetary companion as a possible cause of these non-zero\neccentricities. For simplicity, we focus on the evolution of a planar\ntwo-planet system subject to slow eccentricity damping and provide an intuitive\ninterpretation of the resulting long-term orbital evolution. We show that\ndissipation shifts the two normal eigenmode frequencies and eccentricity ratios\nof the standard secular theory slightly, and that each mode decays at its own\nrate. Tidal damping of the eccentricities drives orbits to transition between\nperiods of pericenter circulation and libration, and the planetary system\nsettles into a locked state where the pericenters are nearly aligned or\nanti-aligned. Once in the locked state, the eccentricities of the two orbits\ndecrease very slowly due to tides rather than at the much more rapid\nsingle-planet rate, and thus eccentric orbits, even for close-in planets, can\noften survive much longer than the age of the system. Assuming that an observed\nclose-in planet on an elliptical orbit is apsidally-locked to a more distant,\nand perhaps unseen companion, we provide a constraint on the mass, semi-major\naxis, and eccentricity of the companion. We find the observed two-planet system\nHAT-P-13 might be in just such an apsidally-locked state, with parameters that\nobey our constraint well. We also survey close-in single planets, and found\nthat none provide compelling evidence for unseen companions. Instead, we\nsuspect that (1) orbits are circular, (2) tidal damping rates are slower than\nour assumption, or (3) a recent event has excited these eccentricities.

We find that nonlinear damping\nof the BAO signal is less severe for halos in the mass range we investigate\nthan for dark matter. The amount of damping depends weakly on the halo mass.\nThe correlation functions show a mass-dependent drop of the halo clustering\nbias below roughly 90 Mpc/h, which coincides with the scale of the BAO trough.\nThe drop of bias is 4% for halos with mass M>10^{14} Msun/h and reduces to\nroughly 2% for halos with mass M>10^{13} Msun/h. In contrast, halo biases in\nsimulations without BAO change more smoothly around 90 Mpc/h. In Fourier space,\nthe bias of M>10^{14} Msun/h halos decreases smoothly by 11% from wavenumber k\n= 0.012 h/Mpc to 0.2 h/Mpc, whereas that of M>10^{13} Msun/h halos decreases by\nless than 4% over the same range.

The main goal of\nour article is to make a comprehensive study of the local and asymptotic\nbehavior of $\\{Y(t):t\\in\\R\\}$; to this end, one needs to derive fine path\nproperties of $\\{X(u,v) : (u,v)\\in\\R \\times (1/\\alpha,1)\\}$, the field\ngenerating the latter process (i.e. one has $Y(t)=X(t,H(t))$ for all $t\\in\\R$).\nThis leads us to introduce random wavelet series representations of $\\{X(u,v) :\n(u,v)\\in\\R \\times (1/\\alpha,1)\\}$ as well as of all its pathwise partial\nderivatives of any order with respect to $v$.

Among other things, we solve a conjecture of Stoev and\nTaqqu, concerning the existence for LMSM of a modification with almost surely\ncontinuous paths; moreover we provides some bounds for the local H\\\"older\nexponent of LMSM: namely, we obtain a quasi-optimal global modulus of\ncontinuity for it, and also an optimal local one. It is worth noticing that,\neven in the quite classical case of LFSM, the latter optimal local modulus of\ncontinuity provides a new result which was unknown so far.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Feb 2013 08:37:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-08"}

Clearly, $ex_1(n,H)=2ex(n,H)$, where $ex(n,H)$\ndenotes the classical Tur\\'an number, i.e., the maximum number of edges among\nall $H$-free graphs with $n$ vertices. Pikhurko and Taraz generalize this\nTur\\'an-type problem: let $f$ be a non-negative increasing real function and\n$e_f(G)=\\sum_{i=1}^n f(d_i)$, and then define $ex_f(n,H)$ as the maximum value\nof $e_f(G)$ taken over all graphs with $n$ vertices that do not contain $H$ as\na subgraph. Observe that $ex_f(n,H)=ex(n,H)$ if $f(x)=x/2$,\n$ex_f(n,H)=ex_p(n,H)$ if $f(x)=x^p$. Bollob\\'as and Nikiforov mentioned that it\nis important to study concrete functions. They gave an example\n$f(x)=\\phi(k)={x\\choose k}$, since $\\sum_{i=1}^n{d_i\\choose k}$ counts the\n$(k+1)$-vertex subgraphs of $G$ with a dominating vertex.\n  Denote by $T_r(n)$ the $r$-partite Tur\\'an graph of order $n$. In this paper,\nusing the Bollob\\'as--Nikiforov's methods, we give some results on\n$ex_{\\phi}(n,K_{r+1})$ $(r\\geq 2)$ as follows: for $k=1,2$,\n$ex_\\phi(n,K_{r+1})=e_\\phi(T_r(n))$; for each $k$, there exists a constant\n$c=c(k)$ such that for every $r\\geq c(k)$ and sufficiently large $n$,\n$ex_\\phi(n,K_{r+1})=e_\\phi(T_r(n))$; for a fixed $(r+1)$-chromatic graph $H$\nand every $k$, when $n$ is sufficiently large, we have\n$ex_\\phi(n,H)=e_\\phi(n,K_{r+1})+o(n^{k+1})$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Feb 2013 10:07:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-08"}

In this context, the notion of source states\ncharacterizing the X-ray emission from black-hole binaries and neutron-star\nlow-mass X-ray binaries revealed to be a very useful tool to disentangle the\ncomplex spectral and aperiodic phenomenology displayed by those classes of\naccreting objects. Be/X-ray binaries constitute another major class of\ntransient accreting binaries, for which very little work has been done on the\ncorrelated timing and spectral variability. Especially, no definition of source\nstates exists for this class, in spite of their highly variable X-ray emission.\nWhen active, Be/X-ray binaries are among the brightest objects in the X-ray sky\nand are characterized by dramatic variability in brightness on timescales\nranging from seconds to years. It is then worth it to ask whether a definition\nof spectral states is possible for these systems. In this work, we try to\naddress such a question, investigating whether accreting X-ray pulsars display\nsource states and characterizing those states through their spectral\nproperties. Our results show that Be/X-ray pulsars trace two different branches\nin their hardness-intensity diagram: the horizontal branch, a low-intensity\nstate, and the diagonal branch, a high-intensity state that only appears when\nthe X-ray luminosity exceeds a critical limit.

Special care was taken to discriminate\ncandidate cluster stars from field stars and to subtract the background\ncontamination from both profiles. By examining the contour levels of the number\ndensity, we found that the stellar distribution becomes clumpy at radial\ndistances larger than about 13 arcminutes, and there is no preferred\norientation of contours in space. We performed detailed fits of King and Wilson\nmodels to the observed profiles. The best-fit models underestimate the number\ndensity inside the core radius.

The evolution of the closed string is envisaged on the\nworldsheet in the presence of its massless excitations. The duality symmetry is\nstudied when some of the spacial coordinates are compactified on d-dimensional\ntorus, $T^d$. The known results are reviewed to elucidate that equations of\nmotion for the compact coordinates are $O(d,d)$ covariant, $d$ being the number\nof compact directions. Next, the vertex operators of excited massive levels are\nconsidered in a simple compactification scheme. It is shown that the vertex\noperators for each massive level can be cast in a T-duality invariant form in\nsuch a case. Subsequently, the duality properties of superstring is\ninvestigated in the NSR formulation for the massless backgrounds such as\ngraviton and antisymmetric tensor. The worldsheet superfield formulation is\nfound to be very suitable for our purpose. The Hassan-Sen compactification is\nadopted and it is shown that the worldsheet equations of motion for compact\nsuperfields to be very suitable for our purpose. The Hassan-Sen\ncompactification is adopted and it is shown that the worldsheet equations of\nmotion for compact superfields are $O(d,d)$ covariant when the backgrounds are\nindependent of superfields along compact directions. The vertex operators for\nexcited levels are presented in the NS-NS sector and it is shown that they can\nbe cast in T-duality invariant form for the case of Hassan-Sen compactification\nscheme.

Ideally therefore, any\ncontemporary analysis of online extreme right activity requires the\nconsideration of multiple data sources, rather than being restricted to a\nsingle platform. We investigate the potential for Twitter to act as a gateway\nto communities within the wider online network of the extreme right, given its\nfacility for the dissemination of content. A strategy for representing\nheterogeneous network data with a single homogeneous network for the purpose of\ncommunity detection is presented, where these inherently dynamic communities\nare tracked over time. We use this strategy to discover and analyze persistent\nEnglish and German language extreme right communities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Feb 2013 12:20:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 May 2013 13:32:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-17"}

Recently, a lot of interest has been devoted to desynchronizing\ndelayed feedback deep brain stimulation (DBS). This type of synchrony control\nwas shown to destabilize the synchronized state in networks of simple model\noscillators as well as in networks of coupled model neurons. However, the\ndynamics of the neural activity in Parkinson's disease exhibits complex\nintermittent synchronous patterns, far from the idealized synchronous dynamics\nused to study the delayed feedback stimulation. This study explores the action\nof delayed feedback stimulation on partially synchronized oscillatory dynamics,\nsimilar to what one observes experimentally in parkinsonian patients. We employ\na model of the basal ganglia networks which reproduces experimentally observed\nfine temporal structure of the synchronous dynamics. When the parameters of our\nmodel are such that the synchrony is unphysiologically strong, the feedback\nexerts a desynchronizing action. However, when the network is tuned to\nreproduce the highly variable temporal patterns observed experimentally, the\nsame kind of delayed feedback may actually increase the synchrony. As network\nparameters are changed from the range which produces complete synchrony to\nthose favoring less synchronous dynamics, desynchronizing delayed feedback may\ngradually turn into synchronizing stimulation. This suggests that delayed\nfeedback DBS in Parkinson's disease may boost rather than suppress\nsynchronization and is unlikely to be clinically successful. The study also\nindicates that delayed feedback stimulation may not necessarily exhibit a\ndesynchronization effect when acting on a physiologically realistic partially\nsynchronous dynamics, and provides an example of how to estimate the\nstimulation effect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Feb 2013 14:30:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-05"}

The \\emph{Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager} (HMI)\nonboard the \\emph{Solar Dynamics Observatory} (SDO) captured the entire\nemergence of NOAA AR 11158. This region emerged as two distinct bipoles,\npossibly connected underneath the photosphere, yet characterized by different\nphotospheric field evolutions and fluxes. The combined active region complex\nproduced 15 GOES C--class, 2 M--class, and the X2.2 Valentine's Day Flare\nduring the four days after initial emergence on February 12th, 2011. The M and\nX class flares are of particular interest because they are nonhomologous,\ninvolving different subregions of the active region. We use a Magnetic Charge\nTopology together with the Minimum Current Corona model of the coronal field to\nmodel field evolution of the complex. Combining this with observations of flare\nribbons in the 1600\\AA\\ channel of the \\emph{Atmospheric Imaging Assembly}\n(AIA) onboard SDO, we propose a minimization algorithm for estimating the\namount of reconnected flux and resulting drop in magnetic free energy during a\nflare. For the M6.6, M2.2, and X2.2 flares, we find a flux exchange of\n$4.2\\times 10^{20}\\unit{Mx},\\ 2.0 \\times 10^{20}\\unit{Mx}, \\hbox{and} 21.0\n\\times 10^{20}\\unit{Mx}$, respectively, resulting in free energy drops of\n$3.89\\times 10^{30}\\unit{ergs}, 2.62\\times 10^{30}\\unit{ergs}, \\hbox{and}\n1.68\\times 10^{32}\\unit{ergs}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Feb 2013 15:55:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}
