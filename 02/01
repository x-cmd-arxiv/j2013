Throughout the observing period, the 0.1 GeV < E < 300 GeV gamma-ray\nflux was highly variable, undergoing several flaring events where the daily\nflux exceeded 10^{-5} photons cm^{-2} s^{-1} on 3 separate occasions. The\nincreased photon statistics of these large flares allowed the observations to\nbe re-analysed in 6 and 3 hour intervals, revealing flux doubling timescales as\nsmall as 1.3\\pm0.12 hours during the flare rise time, and flux halving\ntimescales of 1.21\\pm0.15 hours during the flare decay.

(ii) To what extent does particle\nconservation influence pattern formation? To answer these questions we suggest\na simple kinetic model permitting to depict some of the interaction properties\nbetween freely moving particles and particles integrated in clusters. To this\nend, we introduce two particle species: single and cluster particles.\nSpecifically, we account for coalescence of clusters from single particles,\nassembly of single particles on existing clusters, collisions between clusters,\nand cluster disassembly. Coarse-graining our kinetic model, (i) we demonstrate\nthat particle shape (i.e. aspect ratio) shifts the scale of the transition\ndensity, but does not impact the instabilities at the ordering threshold. (ii)\nWe show that the validity of particle conservation determines the existence of\na longitudinal instability, which tends to amplify density heterogeneities\nlocally, and in turn triggers a wave pattern with wave vectors parallel to the\naxis of macroscopic order. If the system is in contact with a particle\nreservoir this instability vanishes due to a compensation of density\nheterogeneities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Jan 2013 17:47:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-23"}

We describe the interface, implementation, and design rationale of\neach modular component.\n  The library meets several design goals: a high level of modularity, allowing\nthe individual components to be replaced by different versions;\nhigh-efficiency, being competitive with other FD implementations; a glass-box\napproach, so the user can specify new constraints at different levels; and a\nProlog implementation, in order to ease the integration with Ciao's code\nanalysis components.\n  The core is built upon two small libraries which implement integer ranges and\nclosures. On top of that, a finite domain variable datatype is defined, taking\ncare of constraint reexecution depending on range changes. These three\nlibraries form what we call the FD kernel of the library.\n  This FD kernel is used in turn to implement several higher-level finite\ndomain constraints, specified using indexicals.

This constrained ROC\nestimator gives an area under the curve (AUC) estimate that is biased high with\nrespect to the usual empirical AUC estimate, but may be less biased with\nrespect to the underlying continuous true AUC value. The constrained ROC\nestimator has lower variance than the usual empirical one.

The goal is to study methods for the\ndetermination of hierarchical clusters, i.e., a family of nested partitions\nindexed by a connectivity parameter, induced by the given dissimilarity\nstructures. Our construction of hierarchical clustering methods is based on\ndefining admissible methods to be those methods that abide by the axioms of\nvalue - nodes in a network with two nodes are clustered together at the maximum\nof the two dissimilarities between them - and transformation - when\ndissimilarities are reduced, the network may become more clustered but not\nless. Several admissible methods are constructed and two particular methods,\ntermed reciprocal and nonreciprocal clustering, are shown to provide upper and\nlower bounds in the space of admissible methods. Alternative clustering\nmethodologies and axioms are further considered. Allowing the outcome of\nhierarchical clustering to be asymmetric, so that it matches the asymmetry of\nthe original data, leads to the inception of quasi-clustering methods. The\nexistence of a unique quasi-clustering method is shown. Allowing clustering in\na two-node network to proceed at the minimum of the two dissimilarities\ngenerates an alternative axiomatic construction. There is a unique clustering\nmethod in this case too. The paper also develops algorithms for the computation\nof hierarchical clusters using matrix powers on a min-max dioid algebra and\nstudies the stability of the methods proposed. We proved that most of the\nmethods introduced in this paper are such that similar networks yield similar\nhierarchical clustering results. Algorithms are exemplified through their\napplication to networks describing internal migration within states of the\nUnited States (U.S.) and the interrelation between sectors of the U.S. economy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Jan 2013 19:39:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Sep 2014 18:21:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-03"}

However,\nthe benefits of exploiting symmetry in order to reduce storage and computation\nis in conflict with a desire to simplify memory access patterns. In this paper,\nwe propose a blocked data structure (Blocked Compact Symmetric Storage) wherein\nwe consider the tensor by blocks and store only the unique blocks of a\nsymmetric tensor. We propose an algorithm-by-blocks, already shown of benefit\nfor matrix computations, that exploits this storage format by utilizing a\nseries of temporary tensors to avoid redundant computation. Further, partial\nsymmetry within temporaries is exploited to further avoid redundant storage and\nredundant computation. A detailed analysis shows that, relative to storing and\ncomputing with tensors without taking advantage of symmetry and partial\nsymmetry, storage requirements are reduced by a factor of $ O\\left( m! \\right)$\nand computational requirements by a factor of $O\\left( (m+1)!/2^m \\right)$,\nwhere $ m $ is the order of the tensor.

However, this phenomenon is intermittent since\nit was observed in several but not all seasons. A long-term monitoring of the\nmagnetic activity of HD179949 is required to study the amplitude and time\nscales of star-planet interactions. In 2009 we performed a simultaneous optical\nand X-ray spectroscopic campaign to monitor the magnetic activity of HD179949\nduring ~5 orbital periods and ~2 stellar rotations. We analyzed the CaII H&K\nlines as a proxy for chromospheric activity, and we studied the X-ray emission\nin search of flux modulations and to determine basic properties of the coronal\nplasma. A detailed analysis of the flux in the cores of the CaII H&K lines and\na similar study of the X-ray photometry shows evidence of source variability,\nincluding one flare. The analysis of the the time series of chromospheric data\nindicates a modulation with a ~11 days period, compatible with the stellar\nrotation period at high latitudes. Instead, the X-ray light curve suggests a\nsignal with a period of ~4 days, consistent with the presence of two active\nregions on opposite hemispheres. The observed variability can be explained,\nmost likely, as due to rotational modulation and to intrinsic evolution of\nchromospheric and coronal activity. There is no clear signature related to the\norbital motion of the planet, but the possibility that just a fraction of the\nchromospheric and coronal variability is modulated with the orbital period of\nthe planet, or the stellar-planet beat period, cannot be excluded.

The\ntidal stirring model posits that late-type, rotationally-supported dwarfs\nresembling present-day dwarf irregular (dIrr) galaxies can transform into dSphs\nvia interactions with Milky Way-sized hosts. Using collisionless N-body\nsimulations, we investigate for the first time how tidal stirring depends on\nthe dark matter (DM) density distribution in the central stellar region of the\nprogenitor disky dwarf. Specifically, we explore various asymptotic inner\nslopes gamma of the dwarf DM density profiles (rho \\propto r^{-gamma} as r ->\n0). For a given orbit inside the primary, rotationally-supported dwarfs\nembedded in DM halos with core-like density distributions (gamma = 0.2) and\nmild density cusps (gamma = 0.6) demonstrate a substantially enhanced\nlikelihood and efficiency of transformation into dSphs compared to their\ncounterparts with steeper DM density profiles (gamma = 1). Such shallow DM\ndistributions are akin to those of observed dIrrs, highlighting tidal stirring\nas a plausible model for the LG morphology-density relation. When gamma <1, a\nsingle pericentric passage can induce dSph formation and disky dwarfs on\nlow-eccentricity or large-pericenter orbits are able to transform into dSphs;\nthese new results allow the tidal stirring model to explain the existence of\nvirtually all known dSphs across a wide range of distances from their hosts.

The light curve\npeaked at z_P1=21.7 mag, making PS1-10afx comparable to the most luminous known\nSNe, with M_u = -22.3 mag. Our extensive optical and NIR observations indicate\nthat the bolometric light curve of PS1-10afx rose on the unusually fast\ntimescale of ~12 d to the extraordinary peak luminosity of 4.1e44 erg/s (M_bol\n= -22.8 mag) and subsequently faded rapidly. Equally important, the SED is\nunusually red for a SLSN, with a color temperature of 6800 K near maximum\nlight, in contrast to previous H-poor SLSNe, which are bright in the UV. The\nspectra more closely resemble those of a normal SN Ic than any known SLSN, with\na photospheric velocity of 11,000 km/s and evidence for line blanketing in the\nrest-frame UV. Despite the fast rise, these parameters imply a very large\nemitting radius (>5e15 cm). We demonstrate that no existing theoretical model\ncan satisfactorily explain this combination of properties: (i) a nickel-powered\nlight curve cannot match the combination of high peak luminosity with the fast\ntimescale; (ii) models powered by the spindown energy of a rapidly-rotating\nmagnetar predict significantly hotter and faster ejecta; and (iii) models\ninvoking shock breakout through a dense circumstellar medium cannot explain the\nobserved spectra or color evolution. The host galaxy is well detected in\npre-explosion imaging with a luminosity near L*, a star formation rate of 15\nM_sun/yr, and is fairly massive (2e10 M_sun), with a stellar population age of\n1e8 yr, also in contrast to the dwarf hosts of known H-poor SLSNe.

It is observed that defects feature a rather\ncomplex and rich physics, which is well captured by a degenerate Hubbard model\nextended by terms that describe crystal-field splittings and orbital-lattice\ncoupling, as well as by terms generated by defects such as the Coulomb\npotential terms that act both on doped holes and on electrons within occupied\norbitals at undoped sites. We show that the multiplet structure of the excited\nstates generated in such systems by strong electron interactions is well\ndescribed within the unrestricted Hartree-Fock approximation, once the symmetry\nbreaking caused by the onset of magnetic and orbital order is taken into\naccount. Furthermore, we uncover new spectral features that arise within the\nMott-Hubbard gap and in the multiplet spectrum at high energies due to the\npresence of defect states and strong correlations. These features reflect the\naction on electrons/holes of the generalized defect potential that affects\ncharge and orbital degrees of freedom, and indirectly also spin ones. The\npresent study elucidates the mechanism behind the Coulomb gap appearing in the\nband of defect states and investigates the dependence on the electron-electron\ninteractions and the screening by the orbital polarization field. As an\nillustrative example of our general approach, we present explicit calculations\nfor the model describing three t_2g orbital flavors in the perovskite vanadates\ndoped by divalent Sr or Ca ions, such as in La_(1-x)Sr_xVO_3 and\nY_(1-x)Ca_xVO_3 systems.

Recent observations of NSs have presented evidence that cold\nultra dense matter -- present in the core of NSs -- is best described by\n\"normal matter\" equations of state (EoSs). Such EoSs predict that the radii of\nNSs, Rns, are quasi-constant (within measurement errors, of ~10%) for\nastrophysically relevant masses (Mns > 0.5 Msun). The present work adopts this\ntheoretical prediction as an assumption, and uses it to constrain a single Rns\nvalue from five qLMXB targets with available high signal-to-noise X-ray\nspectroscopic data. Employing a Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo approach, we produce\nthe marginalized posterior distribution for Rns, constrained to be the same\nvalue for all five NSs in the sample. An effort was made to include all\nquantifiable sources of uncertainty into the uncertainty of the quoted radius\nmeasurement. These include the uncertainties in the distances to the GCs, the\nuncertainties due to the Galactic absorption in the direction of the GCs, and\nthe possibility of a hard power-law spectral component for count excesses at\nhigh photon energy, which are observed in some qLMXBs in the Galactic plane.\nUsing conservative assumptions,we found that the radius, common to the five\nqLMXBs and constant for a wide range of masses, lies in the low range of\npossible NS radii, Rns=9.1(+1.3)(-1.5) km (90%-confidence). Such a value is\nconsistent with low-res equations of state. We compare this result with\nprevious radius measurements of NSs from various analyses of different types of\nsystems. In addition, we compare the spectral analyses of individual qLMXBs to\nprevious works.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Jan 2013 21:36:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Jun 2013 22:20:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

Motivated\nby the analysis of excitable systems, a similar reduction has been attempted\nfor non-periodic systems admitting a stable fixed point. In this case, the\nisochrons can still be defined but they do not capture the asymptotic behavior\nof the trajectories. Instead, the sets of interest-that we call isostables-are\ndefined in literature as the sets of points that converge toward the same\ntrajectory on the stable slow manifold of the fixed point. However, it turns\nout that this definition of the isostables holds only for systems with\nslow-fast dynamics. Also, efficient methods for computing the isostables are\nmissing.\n  The present paper provides a general framework for the definition and the\ncomputation of the isostables of stable fixed points, which is based on the\nspectral properties of the so-called Koopman operator. More precisely, the\nisostables are defined as the level sets of a particular eigenfunction of the\nKoopman operator. Through this approach, the isostables are unique and\nwell-defined objects related to the asymptotic properties of the system. Also,\nthe framework reveals that the isostables and the isochrons are two different\nbut complementary notions which define a set of action-angle coordinates for\nthe dynamics. In addition, an efficient algorithm for computing the isostables\nis obtained, which relies on the evaluation of Laplace averages along the\ntrajectories. The method is illustrated with the excitable FitzHugh-Nagumo\nmodel and with the Lorenz model. Finally, we discuss how these methods based on\nthe Koopman operator framework relate to the global linearization of the system\nand to the derivation of special Lyapunov functions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Jan 2013 22:54:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 4 Apr 2013 16:23:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 12 Jun 2013 18:17:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

Some elements of analysis are also provided.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Jan 2013 23:23:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-04"}

We also examine\nthe importance of van der Waals forces in this system by performing\ncalculations using the optB88-vdW density functional, which accounts for\nnon-local correlations. Our calculations reveal that the transition between\nphases I and II is strongly quantum in nature, resulting from a competition\nbetween anisotropic inter-molecular interactions that restrict molecular\nrotation and thermal plus quantum fluctuations of the nuclear positions that\nfacilitate it. The transition from phase II to III is more classical because\nquantum nuclear motion plays only a secondary role and the transition is\ndetermined primarily by the underlying potential energy surface.

For\ngiven M,q find z such that q+Mz>=0, z>=0, z(q + M z)=0,or certify that there is\nno such z. It is well known that the problem of finding a Nash equilibrium for\na bimatrix game (2-NASH) can be formulated as a linear complementarity problem\n(LCP). In addition, 2-NASH is known to be complete in the complexity class PPAD\n(Polynomial-time Parity Argument Directed). However, the ingeniously\nconstructed reduction (which is designed for any PPAD problem) is very\ncomplicated, so while of great theoretical significance, it is not practical\nfor actually solving an LCP via 2-NASH, and it may not provide the potential\ninsight that can be gained from studying the game obtained from a problem\nformulated as an LCP (e.g. market equilibrium). The main goal of this paper is\nthe construction of a simple explicit reduction of any LCP(q,M) that can be\nverified as belonging to PPAD via the graph induced by the generic Lemke\nalgorithm with some positive covering vector d, to a symmetric 2-NASH. In\nparticular, any endpoint of this graph (with the exception of the initial point\nof the algorithm) corresponds to either a solution or to a so-called secondary\nray. Thus, an LCP problem is verified as belonging to PPAD if any secondary ray\ncan be used to construct, in polynomial time, a certificate that there is no\nsolution to the problem. We achieve our goal by showing that for any M,q and a\npositive d satisfying a certain nondegeneracy assumption with respect to M, we\ncan simply and directly construct a symmetric 2-NASH whose Nash equilibria\ncorrespond one-to-one to the end points of the graph induced by LCP(q,M) and\nthe Lemke algorithm with a covering vector d.

Similarly,\nthe OVI Kalpha line is found to disappear occasionally, but not in concert with\nthe variation of the OVII Kalpha line. All these variations are most likely due\nto the presence of changing OVII and OVI Kalpha emission lines of Cyg X-2,\nwhich are blurred together with the absorption ones in the X-ray spectra. A\nre-examination of the Chandra grating data indeed shows evidence for a narrow\nemission line slightly off the OVI Kalpha absorption line. We further show that\nnarrow NV emission lines with varying centroids and fluxes are present in\nfar-UV spectra from the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph aboard the Hubble Space\nTelescope. These results provide new constraints on the accretion around the\nneutron star and on the X-ray-heating of the stellar companion. The\nunderstanding of these physical processes is also important to the fidelity of\nusing such local X-ray binaries for interstellar absorption line spectroscopy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Feb 2013 05:05:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

Faint X-ray\nemission from the ICM out to r_vir is detected. The temperature gradually\ndecreases with radius from ~8 keV in the inner region to ~2 keV at r_vir. The\nentropy profile is shown to flatten beyond r_500, in disagreement with the\nr_1.1 dependence predicted from the accretion shock heating model. The thermal\npressure profile in the range 0.3r_500 < r < r_vir agrees well with that\nobtained from the stacked Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect observations with the\nPlanck satellite. The hydrostatic mass profile in the cluster outskirts (r_500\n< r < r_vir) falls well short of the weak lensing one derived from\nSubaru/Suprime-Cam observations, showing an unphysical decrease with radius.\nThe gas mass fraction at r_vir defined with the lensing total mass agrees with\nthe cosmic baryon fraction from the WMAP 7-year data. All these results\nindicate, rather than the gas-clumping effect, that the bulk of the ICM in the\ncluster outskirts is far from hydrostatic equilibrium and infalling matter\nretained some of its kinetic energy. Finally, combining with our recent Suzaku\nand lensing analysis of Abell 1689, a cluster of similar mass, temperature, and\nredshift, we show that the cluster temperature distribution in the outskirts is\nsignificantly correlated with the galaxy density field in the surrounding\nlarge-scale environment at (1-2)r_vir.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Feb 2013 06:51:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 Feb 2013 02:31:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

However, it\nis difficult to give similar studies to distant (e.g., $z >$ 0.3) galaxies\nbecause of the lack of reliable spectra data. This is actually limited by\ncurrent observational equipments and methods. In fact, the information of the\nstellar ages and metallicities of distant galaxies are crucial for solving the\nproblem of galaxy formation and evolution.

It is thus essential to understand the electron dynamics of the\nDirac fermions, i.e., how they interact with other electrons, phonons and\ndisorders.

The objective of this article is to investigate\nthe application of such techniques for determining performance bounds on road\nnetworks, such as maximum bounds on travel times. The main difficulty to apply\nthe network calculus theory on road networks is the modeling of interaction of\ncars inside one road, or more precisely the congestion phase. We propose a\ntraffic model for a single-lane road without passing, which is compatible with\nthe network calculus theory. The model permits to derive a maximum bound of the\ntravel time of cars through the road. Then, basing on that model, we explain\nhow to extend the approach to model intersections and large-scale networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Feb 2013 10:30:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-04"}

We find that the field configuration in our\nprevious model that reproduces the polarised synchrotron is not compatible with\nthe WMAP 94 GHz polarised emission data. In particular, the high degree of dust\npolarisation in the outer Galaxy (90deg < l < 270deg) implies that the fields\nin the dust-emitting regions are more ordered than the average of\nsynchrotron-emitting regions. This new dust information allows us to constrain\nthe spatial mixing of the coherent and random magnetic field components in the\nouter Galaxy. The inner Galaxy differs in polarisation degree and apparently\nrequires a more complicated scenario than our current model. In the scenario\nthat each interstellar component (including fields and now dust) follows a\nspiral arm modulation, as observed in external galaxies, the changing degree of\nordering of the fields in dust-emitting regions may imply that the dust arms\nand the field component arms are shifted as a varying function of\nGalacto-centric radius.

This idea has gained some\ninstrumental support in recent years, such as with the \"Pi of the Sky\" project.\nThe broad sky coverage of the \"Pi of the Sky\" apparatus results from using\ncameras with wide-angle lenses (20x20 deg field of view). Optics of this kind\nintroduce significant deformations of the point spread function (PSF),\nincreasing with the distance from the frame centre. A deformed PSF results in\nadditional uncertainties in data analysis. Our aim was to create a model\ndescribing highly deformed PSF in optical astronomy, allowing uncertainties\ncaused by image deformations to be reduced. Detailed laboratory measurements of\nPSF, pixel sensitivity, and pixel response functions were performed. These data\nwere used to create an effective high quality polynomial model of the PSF.\nFinally, tuning the model and tests in applications to the real sky data were\nperformed.\n  We have developed a PSF model that accurately describes even very deformed\nstars in our wide-field experiment. The model is suitable for use in any other\nexperiment with similar image deformation, with a simple tuning of its\nparameters. Applying this model to astrometric procedures results in a\nsignificant improvement over standard methods, while basic photometry precision\nperformed with the model is comparable to the results of an optimised aperture\nalgorithm. Additionally, the model was used to search for a weak signal --\nnamely a possible gamma ray burst optical precursor -- showing very promising\nresults.

We derive a luminosity for the progenitor, in comparison\nwith MARCS model SEDs, of log L/Lsun = 5.15+/-0.19, from which we infer an\ninitial mass range of 14-22Msun. This is the first SN with an identified\nprogenitor to be followed by the Public ESO Spectroscopic Survey of Transient\nObjects (PESSTO).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Feb 2013 12:55:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

Using the XMM-Newton archival data consisting\nof multiple pointing observations of the northwestern rim of the remnant, we\ninvestigate the spatial properties of the nonthermal X-ray emission as a\nfunction of distance from an outer shock wave. All X-ray spectra are well\nreproduced by an absorbed power-law model above 2 keV. It is found that the\nspectra show gradual softening from a photon index 2.56 in the rim region to\n2.96 in the interior region. We show that this radial profile can be\ninterpreted as a gradual decrease of the cutoff energy of the electron spectrum\ndue to synchrotron cooling. By using a simple spectral evolution model that\nincludes continuous synchrotron losses, the spectral softening can be\nreproduced with the magnetic field strength in the post-shock flow to less than\nseveral tens of uG. If this is a typical magnetic field in the SNR shell,\ngamma-ray emission would be accounted for by inverse Compton scattering of\nhigh-energy electrons that also produce the synchrotron X-ray emission. Future\nhard X-ray imaging observations with Nustar and ASTRO-H and TeV gamma-ray\nobservations with the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) will allow to us to\nexplore other possible explanations of the systematic softening of the X-ray\nspectra.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Feb 2013 14:27:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

Observations of cataclysmic variables in globular clusters appear to\nshow a dearth of outbursts compared to those observed in the field. A number of\nexplanations have been proposed, including low mass-transfer rates and/or\nmoderate magnetic fields implying higher mass white dwarfs than the average\nobserved in the field. Alternatively this apparent dearth may be simply a\nselection bias. Aims. We examine multi-wavelength data of a new cataclysmic\nvariable, CV1, in the globular cluster M 22 to try to constrain its period and\nmagnetic nature, with an aim at understanding whether globular cluster\ncataclysmic variables are intrinsically different from those observed in the\nfield. Methods. We use the sub-arcsecond resolution of the Chandra ACIS-S to\nidentify the X-ray counterpart to CV1 and analyse the X-ray spectrum to\ndetermine the spectral model that best describes this source. We also examine\nthe low resolution optical spectrum for emission lines typical of cataclysmic\nvariables. Cross correlating the Halpha line in each individual spectrum also\nallows us to search for orbital motion. Results. The X-ray spectrum reveals a\nsource best-fitted with a high-temperature bremsstrahlung model and an X-ray\nunabsorbed luminosity of 1.8e32 erg/s (0.3-8.0 keV), which are typical of\ncataclysmic variables. Optical spectra reveal Balmer emission lines, which are\nindicative of an accretion disc. Potential radial velocity in the Halpha\nemission line is detected and a period for CV1 is proposed. Conclusions. These\nobservations support the CV identification. The radial velocity measurements\nsuggest that CV1 may have an orbital period of ~7 hours, but further higher\nresolution optical spectroscopy of CV1 is needed to unequivocally establish the\nnature of this CV and its orbital period.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Feb 2013 15:05:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

The first study uses new Chandra X-ray and ground-based\nrest-frame UV observations of 7 quasars with mini-BALs at extreme high speeds,\nin the range 0.1c to 0.2c, to test the idea that strong radiative shielding is\nneeded to moderate the mini-BAL ionizations and facilitate their acceleration\nto extreme speeds. We find that the X-ray absorption is weak or absent, with\ngenerally N_H < few x 10^22 mc^-2, and that radiative shielding is not\nimportant. We argue that the mini-BAL ionizations are controlled, instead, by\nhigh gas densities of order n_H ~ 4 x 10^8 cm^-3 in small outflow\nsubstructures. If we conservatively assume that the total column density in the\nmini-BAL gas is N_H < 10^22 cm^-2, covering >15% of the UV continuum source\nalong our lines of sight (based on measured line depths), then the radial\nthickness of these outflows is only Delta_R < 3 x 10^13 cm and their transverse\nsize is > 8 x 10^15 cm. Thus the outflow regions have the shape of very thin\n\"pancakes\" viewed face-on, or they occupy larger volumes like a spray of dense\ncloudlets with a very small volume filling factor. We speculate that this\nsituation (with ineffective shielding and small dense outflow substructures)\napplies to most quasar outflows, including BALs. Our second study focuses from\nBALs of low-abundance ions, mainly PV 1118,1128 A, whose significant strengths\nimply large column densities, N_H > 10^22 cm^-2, that can further challenge\nmodels of the outflow acceleration. In spite of the difficulties of finding\nthis line in the Ly-alpha forest, a search through the SDSS DR9 quasar catalog\nreveals >50 BAL sources at redshifts z>2.3 with strong PV BALs, which we are\nnow using to characterize the general properties of high-column outflows.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Feb 2013 15:07:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-04"}

For improving the\napplication throughput, recent research works have embedded application\ndeadline information into design of network flow schedule to meet the latency\nrequirement. Here, arises a critical question: does application-level\nthroughput mean providing better quality service? We note that there are\nusually a set of semantic related responses (or flows) for answering a query;\nand, some responses are highly correlative with the query while others do not.\nThus, this observation motivates us to associate the importance of the contents\nwith the application flows (or responses) in order to enhance the service\nquality. We first model the application importance maximization problem in a\ngeneric network and in a server-centric network. Since both of them are too\ncomplicated to be deployed in the real world, we propose the importance-aware\ndelivery protocol, which is a distributed event-driven rate-based delivery\ncontrol protocol, for server-centric datacenter networks. The proposed protocol\nis able to make use of the multiple disjoin paths of server-centric network,\nand jointly consider flow importance, flow size, and deadline to maximize the\ngoodput of most-related semantic data of a query. Through real-data-based or\nsynthetic simulations, the results show that our proposed protocol\nsignificantly outperforms D3 and MPTCP in terms of the precision at K and the\nsum of application-level importance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Feb 2013 15:44:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-04"}
