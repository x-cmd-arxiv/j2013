Using a red-clump star method, we estimate an interstellar\nextinction towards the pulsar of 2 mag, which is consistent with the absorbing\ncolumn density derived form X-rays. The respective distance agrees with the\ndispersion measure distance. We reanalyse the Chandra X-ray data and compare\nthe dereddened upper limits with the unabsorbed X-ray spectrum of the pulsar.\nWe find that regarding its optical-X-ray spectral properties this gamma-ray\npulsar is not distinct from other pulsars detected in both ranges. However,\nlike the Vela pulsar, it is very inefficient in the optical and X-rays. Among a\ndozen optical sources overlapping with the pulsar X-ray nebula we find one with\nV = 26.9 and R = 26.3 mag, whose colour is slightly bluer then that of the\nfield stars and consistent with the peculiar colours typical for pulsar nebula\nfeatures. It positionally coincides with a relatively bright feature of the\npulsar X-ray nebula, resembling the Crab wisp and locating in 2 arcsec from the\npulsar. We suggest this source as a counterpart candidate to the feature. Based\non the substantial interstellar extinction towards the pulsar and its optical\ninefficiency, further optical studies should be carried out at longer\nwavelengths.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Feb 2013 17:02:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-17"}

We show that parimagnetism is a general\nbehavior along the $R$Co$_2$ ferrimagnetic series ($R$ being a heavy rare earth\nion). XMCD results evidence the presence of two compensation temperatures,\ndefining two different parimagnetic configurations, which is a fully unexpected\nresult. The inverse $\\chi_{ac}$ curve exhibits a deviation from Curie-Weiss\nbehavior which is recovered under applied magnetic field. The large excess of\npolarizability above the critical temperature proves the existence of an\nenhanced effective moment due to the presence of short range magnetic\ncorrelations, which are also observed in TS measurements. The combination of TS\nand XMCD measurements allows to depict new magnetic phase diagrams for the\n$R$Co$_2$ series. A new scenario allowing to understand the observed\nphenomenology as a Griffiths phase-like behavior is proposed, where the\namorphous $R$Co$_2$ represents the undiluted system case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Feb 2013 17:53:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-11"}

This strongly contrasts with symmetric BC-SRRs which present only\none resonance for shifts up to 0.75Lo.

Exact realizations of the underlying stochastic\nprocess described by the SDLR model can be generated by the recently proposed\nFirst-Passage Kinetic Monte Carlo (FPKMC) method.

From a\nholographic perspective, these bulk theories are dual to two-dimensional CFTs\nwith W_N symmetry algebras, and the black hole solutions are dual to thermal\nstates with higher spin chemical potentials and charges turned on. Because the\nnotion of horizon area is not gauge-invariant in the higher spin theory, the\ntraditional approaches to the computation of black hole entropy must be\nreconsidered. One possibility, explored in the recent literature, involves\ndemanding the existence of a partition function in the CFT, and consistency\nwith the first law of thermodynamics. This approach is not free from\nambiguities, however, and in particular different definitions of energy result\nin different expressions for the entropy.

In this paper, we discuss the impact of the\nwarmer CMB on (sub-)millimeter observations of high-redshift galaxies. The CMB\naffects the observed (sub-)millimeter dust continuum and the line emission\n(e.g. carbon monoxide, CO) in two ways: (i) it provides an additional source of\n(both dust and gas) heating; and (ii) it is a non-negligible background against\nwhich the line and continuum emission are measured.

In particular, we provide an example of a situation where an\neffective description of extremal non-supersymmetric spike configurations is\nshown to capture correctly features of the exact solutions beyond its strict\nregime of validity. This observation hints at the existence of improved\nconvergence properties in the underlying derivative expansion scheme without\nthe necessary presence of supersymmetry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Feb 2013 21:00:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-06"}

The\ndegree of flatness can be tuned by varying the number of graphene layers N. For\nN = 7 the bands become nearly flat, with a small bandwidth of 3.6 meV. The two\nnearly flat bands coming from the K and K' valleys cross along lines in the\nreduced zone. Weak intervalley tunneling turns the bandcrossing into an avoided\ncrossing, producing two nearly flat bands with global Chern number zero, but\nwith local Berry curvature. The flatness of the bands suggests that many body\neffects will dominate the physics, while the local Berry curvature of the bands\nendows the system with a nontrivial quantum geometry. The quantum geometry\neffects manifest themselves through the quantum distance (Fubini-Study) metric,\nrather than the more conventional Chern number. Multilayer graphene on BN thus\nprovides a platform for investigating the effect of interactions in a system\nwith a non-trivial quantum distance metric, without the complication of\nnon-zero Chern numbers.

Under some technical assumptions, we can prove that scale invariant\nquantum field theories in $d=2$ dimension necessarily possess the enhanced\nconformal symmetry. The use of the conformal symmetry is well appreciated in\nthe literature, but the fact that all the scale invariant phenomena in $d=2$\ndimension enjoy the conformal property relies on the deep structure of the\nrenormalization group. The outstanding question is whether this feature is\nspecific to $d=2$ dimension or it holds in higher dimensions, too. As of\nJanuary 2014, our consensus is that there is no known example of scale\ninvariant but non-conformal field theories in $d=4$ dimension under the\nassumptions of (1) unitarity, (2) Poincar\\'e invariance (causality), (3)\ndiscrete spectrum in scaling dimension, (4) existence of scale current and (5)\nunbroken scale invariance in the vacuum.

It is first examined if\nthe quantum discord is classically described by the hidden-variable model of\nBell in the Hilbert space with $d=2$. The criterion of vanishing quantum\ndiscord is related to the notion of reduction and, surprisingly, the\nhidden-variable model in $d=2$, which has been believed to be consistent so\nfar, is in fact inconsistent and excluded by the analysis of conditional\nmeasurement and reduction. The description of the full contents of quantum\ndiscord by the deterministic hidden-variables models is not possible. We also\nre-examine CHSH inequality. It is shown that the well-known prediction of CHSH\ninequality $|B|\\leq 2$ for the CHSH operator $B$ introduced by Cirel'son is not\nunique. This non-uniqueness arises from the failure of linearity condition in\nthe non-contextual hidden-variables model in $d=4$ used by Bell and CHSH, in\nagreement with Gleason's theorem which excludes $d=4$ non-contextual\nhidden-variables models. If one imposes the linearity condition, their model is\nconverted to a factored product of two $d=2$ models which describes quantum\nmechanical separable states. The CHSH inequality thus does not test the\nhidden-variables model in $d=4$. This observation is consistent with an\napplication of the CHSH inequality to quantum cryptography by Ekert, which is\nbased on mixed separable states without referring to dispersion-free\nrepresentations.

In oscillatory rheological tests, this skin is found to\nintroduce a yield stress that typically dominates the elastic response but can\nbe tuned by exposing the metal to hydrochloric acid solutions of different\nconcentration. We systematically studied the normal impact of eutectic\ngallium-indium (eGaIn) drops under different oxidation conditions and show how\nthis leads to two different dynamical regimes. At low impact velocity (or low\nWeber number), eGaIn droplets display strong recoil and rebound from the\nimpacted surface when the oxide layer is removed. In addition, the degree of\ndrop deformation or spreading during the impact is controlled by the oxide\nskin. We show that the scaling law known from ordinary liquids for the maximum\nspreading radius as a function of impact velocity can still be applied to the\ncase of oxidized eGaIn if an effective Weber number $We^{\\star}$ is employed\nthat uses an effective surface tension factoring in the yield stress. In\ncontrast, no influence on spreading from different oxidations conditions is\nobserved for high impact velocity. This suggests that the initial kinetic\nenergy is mostly damped by bulk viscous dissipation. Results from both regimes\ncan be collapsed in an impact phase diagram controlled by two variables, the\nmaximum spreading factor $P_m = R_0/R_m$, given by the ratio of initial to\nmaximum drop radius, and the impact number $K = We^{\\star}/Re^{4/5}$, which\nscales with the effective Weber number $We^{\\star}$ as well as the Reynolds\nnumber $Re$.

Previous works showed that binary\nevolution can make the spectra of binary star populations significantly\ndifferent from those of single star populations. However, the effect of binary\nevolution has not been taken into account in most works of spectral fitting of\ngalaxies. This paper studies the role of binary evolution in spectral fitting\nof early-type galaxies, via a stellar population synthesis model including both\nsingle and binary star populations. Spectra from ultraviolet to optical band\nare fitted to determine a few parameters of galaxies. The results show that the\ninclusion of binaries in stellar population models may lead to obvious change\nin the determination of some galaxy parameters and therefore it is potentially\nimportant for spectral studies. In particular, the ages of young components of\ncomposite stellar populations become much older when using binary star\npopulation models instead of single star population models. This implies that\nbinary star population models will measure significantly different star\nformation histories (SFHs) for galaxies compared to single star population\nmodels. In addition, stellar population models with binary interactions measure\nlarger dust extinctions than single star population models on average. It\nsuggests that when using binary star population models instead of single star\npopulation models, negative extinctions are possibly unnecessary in spectral\nfitting of early-type galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Feb 2013 03:34:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

In contrast to the current\nliterature, we do not use money to assess the relative utilities of jobs.\nInstead, to calculate the contribution of an organization, we determine how the\npresence of this organization influences the performance of other\norganizations. Our approach can be used with arbitrary utility function (e.g.,\nflow time, tardiness, resource utilization), but we argue that the utility\nfunction should be strategy resilient. The organizations should be discouraged\nfrom splitting, merging or delaying their jobs. We present the unique (to\nwithin a multiplicative and additive constants) strategy resilient utility\nfunction.\n  We show that the problem of fair scheduling is NP-hard and hard to\napproximate. However, for unit-size jobs, we present an FPRAS. Also, we show\nthat the problem parametrized with the number of organizations is FPT. Although\nfor the large number of the organizations the problem is computationally hard,\nthe presented exponential algorithm can be used as a fairness benchmark.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Feb 2013 06:59:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Apr 2014 17:37:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-23"}

In\napplications within the framework of the multiterm model atom (which accounts\nfor quantum interference between magnetic sublevels pertaining either to the\nsame J-level or to different J-levels within the same term) collisional\nprocesses are generally neglected when solving the master equation for the\natomic density matrix. This is partly due to the lack of experimental data\nand/or of approximate theoretical expressions for calculating the collisional\ntransfer and relaxation rates (in particular the rates for interference between\nsublevels pertaining to different J-levels, and the depolarizing rates due to\nelastic collisions). In this paper we formally define and investigate the\ntransfer and relaxation rates due to isotropic inelastic and superelastic\ncollisions that enter the statistical equilibrium equations of a multiterm\natom. Under the hypothesis that the atom-collider interaction can be described\nby a dipolar operator, we provide expressions that relate the collisional rates\nfor interference between different J-levels to the usual collisional rates for\nJ-level populations. Finally, we apply the general equations to the case of a\ntwo-term atom with unpolarized lower term, illustrating the impact of inelastic\nand superelastic collisions on scattering polarization through radiative\ntransfer calculations in a slab of stellar atmospheric plasma anisotropically\nilluminated by the photospheric radiation field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Feb 2013 11:05:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

(2000) was updated using the best\ntheoretical and experimental atomic data available so far. Non-LTE leads to\nstrengthening the O I lines, and the difference between the non-LTE and LTE\nabundances (non-LTE correction) is negative. The departures from LTE grow\ntoward higher effective temperature and lower surface gravity. In the entire\ntemperature range and log g = 4, the non-LTE correction does not exceed 0.05\ndex in absolute value for O I lines in the visible spectral range. The non-LTE\ncorrections are significantly larger for the infrared O I 7771-5 A lines and\nreach -1.9 dex in the model atmosphere with Teff = 10000 K and log g = 2. To\ndifferentiate the effects of inelastic collisions with electrons and neutral\nhydrogen atoms on the statistical equilibrium (SE) of O I, we derived the\noxygen abundance for the three well studied A-type stars Vega, Sirius, and HD\n32115. For each star, non-LTE leads to smaller difference between the infrared\nand visible lines. For example, for Vega, this difference reduces from 1.17 dex\nin LTE down to 0.14 dex when ignoring LTE. To remove the difference between the\ninfrared and visible lines in A-type stars completely, one needs to reduce the\nused electron-impact excitation rates by Barklem (2007) by a factor of 4. In\nthe case of Procyon and the Sun, inelastic collisions with H I affect the SE of\nO I, and agreement between the abundances from different lines is achieved when\nusing the Drawin's formalism to compute collisional rates. The solar mean\noxygen abundance from the O I 6300, 6158, 7771-5, and 8446 A lines is log\nepsilon = 8.74+-0.05, when using the MAFAGS-OS solar model atmosphere and log\nepsilon = 8.78+-0.03, when applying the 3D corrections from the literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Feb 2013 14:36:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-06"}

Total hoop stress is typically estimated\nusing the \"Laplace law.\" We show that this procedure is fundamentally flawed\nfor two reasons: Firstly, the Laplace law predicts total stress incorrectly for\nbiological vessels. Furthermore, because muscle and other biological tissue are\nclosely volume-preserving, quantifications of elastic modulus require the\nremoval of the contribution to total stress from incompressibility. We show\nthat this hydrostatic contribution to total stress has a strong\nmaterial-dependent nonlinear response to deformation that is difficult to\npredict or measure. To address this difficulty, we propose a new practical\nmethod to estimate a mechanically viable modulus of elasticity that can be\napplied both in vivo and in vitro using the same measurements as current\nmethods, with care taken to record the reference state. To be insensitive to\nincompressibility, our method is based on shear stress rather than hoop stress,\nand provides a true measure of the elastic response without application of the\nLaplace law. We demonstrate the accuracy of our method using a mathematical\nmodel of tube inflation with multiple constitutive models. We also re-analyze\nan in vivo study from the gastro-intestinal literature that applied the\nstandard approach and concluded that a drug-induced change in elastic modulus\ndepended on the protocol used to distend the esophageal lumen. Our new method\nremoves this protocol-dependent inconsistency in the previous result.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Feb 2013 15:44:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-06"}

The attention is paid to the problem of estimating the statistical\nsignificance of candidate periodicities found using such non-linear\nperiodograms. This problem is related to the task of quantifying the\ndistributions of maximum values of these periodograms. Based on recent results\nin the mathematical theory of extreme values of random field (the generalized\nRice method), we give a general approach to find handy analytic approximation\nfor these distributions. This approximation has the general form $e^{-z}\nP(\\sqrt z)$, where $P$ is an algebraic polynomial and $z$ being the periodogram\nmaximum.\n  The general tools developed in this paper can be used in a wide variety of\nastronomical applications, for instance in the studies of variable stars and\nextrasolar planets. For this goal, we develop and consider in details the\nso-called von Mises periodogram: a specialized non-linear periodogram where the\nsignal is modelled by the von Mises periodic function $\\exp(\\nu \\cos \\omega\nt)$. This simple function with an additional non-linear parameter $\\nu$ can\nmodel lightcurves of many astronomical objects that show periodic photometric\nvariability of different nature. We prove that our approach can be perfectly\napplied to this non-linear periodogram.\n  We provide a package of auxiliary C++ programs, attached as the online-only\nmaterial. They should faciliate the use of the von Mises periodogram in\npractice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Feb 2013 15:46:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 27 Nov 2013 09:10:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-28"}

However, so far no general consensus on the origin of this trend has\nbeen reached. Several works have proposed the decrease of the covering factor\nof the molecular torus with the luminosity (in the framework of the\nluminosity-dependent unification models) as a possible explanation for the\nX-ray Baldwin effect. Using the fraction of obscured sources measured by recent\nX-ray and IR surveys as a proxy of the half-opening angle of the torus, and the\nrecent Monte-Carlo simulations of the X-ray radiation reprocessed by a\nstructure with a spherical-toroidal geometry by Ikeda et al. (2009) and\nBrightman & Nandra (2011), we test the hypothesis that the X-ray Baldwin effect\nis related to the decrease of the half-opening angle of the torus with the\nluminosity. Simulating the spectra of an unabsorbed population with a\nluminosity-dependent covering factor of the torus as predicted by recent X-ray\nsurveys, we find that this mechanism is able to explain the observed X-ray\nBaldwin effect. Fitting the simulated data with a log-linear L_{2-10keV}-EW\nrelation, we found that in the Seyfert regime (L_{2-10keV}< 10^44.2 erg s^-1)\nluminosity-dependent unification produces a slope consistent with the\nobservations for average values of the equatorial column densities of the torus\nof log N_H^T > 23.1. In the quasar regime (L_{2-10 keV}> 10^44.2 erg s^-1) a\ndecrease of the covering factor of the torus with the luminosity slower than\nthat observed in the Seyfert regime (as found by recent hard X-ray surveys) is\nable to reproduce the observations for 23.2 < log N_H^T < 24.2.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Feb 2013 15:54:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

An\n$n$-dimensional arabesque system has $n$ 2-element circuits, but in addition,\nit displays by construction, two $n$-element circuits which are both positive\nvs one positive and one negative, depending on the parity (even or odd) of the\ndimension $n$. In view of the absence of diagonal terms in their Jacobian\nmatrices, all these dynamical systems are conservative and consequently, they\ncan not possess any attractor. First, we analyze a linear variant of them which\nwe call \"arabesque 0\" or for short \"A0\". For increasing dimensions, the\ntrajectories are increasingly complex open tori. Next, we inserted a single\ncubic nonlinearity that does not affect the signs of its circuits (that we call\n\"arabesque 1\" or for short \"A1\"). These systems have three steady states,\nwhatever the dimension is, in agreement with the order of the nonlinearity. All\nthree are unstable, as there can not be any attractor in their state-space. The\n3D variant (that we call for short \"A1\\_3D\") has been analyzed in some detail\nand found to display a complex mixed set of quasi-periodic and chaotic\ntrajectories. Inserting $n$ cubic nonlinearities (one per equation) in the same\nway as above, we generate systems \"A2\\_$n$D\". A2\\_3D behaves essentially as\nA1\\_3D, in agreement with the fact that the signs of the circuits remain\nidentical.

As it is well-known, the universality of the\nCarnot efficiency is easily demonstrated in a temperature-entropy diagram,\nwhich means that the Carnot efficiecy is independent of the working substance.\nIn this present work we remark that the universality of the Carnot theorem goes\nbeyond the conventional state equations, and it is fulfilled by gas state\nequations that do not behave as ideal gas in the dilution limit when the volume\nis infinite. Some of these unconventional state equations have certain\nthermodynamic \"anomalies\" that nonetheless do not forbid them from obeying the\nCarnot theorem. We discuss how this very general behaviour arises from the\nMaxwell relations, which are connected with a geometrical property expressed\nthrough preserving area transformations. A rule is proposed to calculate the\nMaxwell relations associated with a thermodynamic system by using the\npreserving area relationships. In this way it is possible to calculate the\nnumber of possible preserving area mappings by giving the number of possible\nJacobian identities between all pairs of thermodynamic variables included in\nthe corresponding Gibbs equation. This work is intended for undergraduate and\nspecialists in thermodynamics and related areas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Feb 2013 21:06:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-07"}

We prove that in such an expanding space-time, the geodesics are\ncurved and more precisely, they fluctuate on the boundaries of the expanding\nbasic elements. The non existence of privileged expansion direction leads to\nthe existence of an infinity of fluctuating geodesics between any two locations\nin this space-time, that provides a prediction of polarization in geometric\noptics, and a prediction of an earlier acceleration of the expansion as for the\ncosmic inflation model.

The conchoid surface Gd of a given surface G is roughly speaking\nobtained by increasing the distance of G to a fixed reference point O by d.\nWhereas the offset operation is well known and implemented in most CAD-software\nsystems, the conchoid operation is less known, although already mentioned by\nthe ancient Greeks, and recently studied by some authors. These two operations\nare algebraic and create new objects from given input objects. There is a\nsurprisingly simple relation between the offset and the conchoid operation. As\nderived there exists a rational bijective quadratic map which transforms a\ngiven surface F and its offset surfaces Fd to a surface G and its conchoidal\nsurface Gd, and vice versa. Geometric properties of this map are studied and\nillustrated at hand of some complete examples. Furthermore rational universal\nparameterizations for offsets and conchoid surfaces are provided.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Feb 2013 15:39:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Jun 2013 11:46:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-04"}
