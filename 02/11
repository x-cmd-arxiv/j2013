We point out the possibility that the Higgs bosons appear in\nmodels of top-quark condensation, where the masses of the bosonic excitations\nare related to the top quark mass by the sum rule similar to the Nambu sum rule\nof the NJL models \\cite{Nambu}. This rule was originally considered by Nambu\nfor superfluid $^3$He-B and for the BCS model of superconductivity. It relates\nthe two masses of bosonic excitations existing in each channel of Cooper\npairing to the fermion mass. An example of the Nambu partners is provided by\nthe amplitude and the phase modes in the BCS model describing Cooper pairing in\nthe s-wave channel. This sum rule suggests the existence of the Nambu partners\nfor the 125 GeV Higgs boson. Their masses can be predicted by the Nambu sum\nrule under certain circumstances.

With\nthe next round of upgrades the ground based instruments are likely to make the\nfirst detections of the sources, and a new era of astronomy will begin,\npossibly as early as 2017. Inconveniently, due to seismic noise and baseline\nlength issues, the low frequency (<10Hz) part of the spectrum, where the most\ninteresting events are expected, will not be accessible. The space-based\ndetector, LISA1, was conceived to fill this gap extending the observational\ncapability to about 10-4 Hz. Due to mission cost growth and severe budget\nconstraints, a flight prior to 2030 now seems very unlikely. This paper\nexamines the case for a scaled down mission that is comparable in cost and\nduration to medium scale astrophysics missions such as the 1978 ($630M)\nEinstein (HEAO 2) x-ray Observatory2, the 1989 ($680M) COBE Cosmic Background\nExplorer3, and the 1999 ($420M) FUSE Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer4.\nWe find that a mission of this class is possible if the measurement\nrequirements are somewhat relaxed and a baseline smaller than LISA is used.

Exoplanet searches have unveiled a large population of\nshort-period objects with hot atmospheres, very different from what we find in\nour solar system. Transiting exoplanets whose atmospheres can now be studied by\ntransit spectroscopy receive extremely strong UV fluxes and have typical\ntemperatures ranging from 400 to 2500 K. At these temperatures, UV photolysis\ncross section data are severely lacking. Aims. Our goal is to provide\nhigh-temperature absorption cross sections and their temperature dependency for\nimportant atmospheric compounds. This study is dedicated to CO2, which is\nobserved and photodissociated in exoplanet atmospheres. We also investigate the\ninfluence of these new data on the photochemistry of some exoplanets. We\nperformed these measurements for the 115 - 200 nm range at 300, 410, 480, and\n550 K. In the 195 - 230 nm range, we worked at seven temperatures between 465\nand 800 K. We implemented the measured cross section into a 1D photochemical\nmodel. For wavelengths > 170 nm, the wavelength dependence of\nln(cross-section_CO2(wavelength, T)x1/Qv(T)) can be parametrized with a linear\nlaw. Thus, we can interpolate cross-section_CO2(wavelength, T) at any\ntemperature between 300 and 800 K. Within the studied range of temperature, the\nCO2 cross section can vary by more than two orders of magnitude. This, in\nparticular, makes the absorption of CO2 significant up to wavelengths as high\nas 230 nm. The absorption cross section of CO2 is very sensitive to\ntemperature. The model predicts that accounting for this temperature dependency\nof CO2 cross section can affect the computed abundances of NH3, CO2, and CO by\none order of magnitude in the atmospheres of hot Jupiter and hot Neptune. This\neffect will be more important in hot CO2-dominated atmospheres.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Feb 2013 10:12:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Feb 2013 10:13:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-13"}

We simulate the\ninteraction of the mechanical energy input from a cluster with 3 O-stars into a\ngiant molecular cloud (GMC) clump containing 3240 solar masses of molecular\nmaterial within a 4 pc radius. The cluster wind blows out of the molecular\nclump along low-density channels, into which denser clump material is\nentrained. We find that the densest molecular regions are surprisingly\nresistant to ablation by the cluster wind, in part due to shielding by other\ndense regions closer to the cluster. Nonetheless, molecular material is\ngradually removed by the cluster wind during which mass-loading factors in\nexcess of several 100 are obtained. Because the clump is very porous, 60-75 per\ncent of the injected wind energy escapes the simulation domain, with the\ndifference being radiated. After 4.4 Myr, the massive stars in our simulation\nbegin to explode as supernovae. The highly structured environment into which\nthe SN energy is released allows even weaker coupling to the remaining dense\nmaterial and practically all of the SN energy reaches the wider environment.\nThe molecular material is almost completely dispersed and destroyed after 6\nMyr. The escape fraction of ionizing radiation is estimated to be about 50 per\ncent during the first 4 Myr of the cluster's life. A similar model with a\nlarger and more massive GMC clump reveals the same general picture, though more\ntime is needed for it to be destroyed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Feb 2013 10:54:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

Studies of a range of solar features (faculae, plage, penumbra and\numbra) show that energy transmission from corona to chromosphere can exceed 20%\nof incident energy for wave periods of one second or less. Damping of waves in\nthe chromosphere depends strongly on wave frequency: waves with periods 10\nseconds or longer pass through the chromosphere with relatively little damping,\nhowever, for periods of 1 second or less, a substantial fraction (37%-100%) of\nwave energy entering the chromosphere is damped by ion-neutral friction in the\nmid and upper chromosphere, with electron resistivity playing some role in the\nlower chromosphere and in umbras.

The X-ray emission is best\nreproduced with one-component or two-component non-equilibrium ionisation\nmodels depending on the position.

Recently, Krause et al. (2012) found that supernovae may not be\nable to expel that gas, as required to explain their present day gas-free\nstate, and suggested that a sudden accretion on to the dark remnants, at a\nstage when type II supernovae have ceased, may plausibly lead to fast gas\nexpulsion.

We analyse the\ninteraction of FRMS with the intra-cluster medium (ICM), in particular where,\nwhen and how the second generation of stars may form. From the results, we\ndevelop a timeline of the first approximately 40 Myr of GC evolution. The\nresults of Paper I imply three phases during which the ICM is in a\nfundamentally different state, namely the wind bubble phase (lasting 3.5 to 8.8\nMyr), the supernova phase (lasting 26.2 to 31.5 Myr), and the dark remnant\naccretion phase (lasting 0.1 to 4 Myr): (i) Quickly after the first generation\nmassive stars have formed, stellar wind bubbles compress the ICM into thin\nfilaments. No stars may form in the normal way during this phase, due to the\nhigh Lyman-Werner flux density. If the first generation massive stars have\nhowever equatorial ejections, as we proposed in the FRMS scenario, accretion\nmay resume in the shadow of the equatorial ejecta. The second generation stars\nmay then form due to gravitational instability in these discs that are fed by\nboth the FRMS ejecta and pristine gas.

A theoretical model based on the de Gennes model for\nthe smectic A phase, the Helfrich model of membrane elasticity and a simple\nedge energy has been previously used to calculate the disk-ribbon phase\ndiagram. In this paper we apply this model to the nucleation process of\nribbons. First, we study the \"rippled disks\" that have been observed as\nprecursors of ribbons. Using a model shape proposed by Meyer which includes\nrippling in both the in-plane and out of plane directions, we study the\nenergetics of the disks as functions of the edge energy modulus (a measure of\nthe polymer concentration) and the mean curvature modulus k. We find that as\nthe edge energy modulus is reduced the radial size of the ripples grows rapidly\nin agreement with experimental observations. For small enough k we find that\nthe out of plane size of the ripples grows but its value saturates at a\nfraction of the twist penetration depth, too small to be experimentally\nobservable. For large k the membrane remains flat though rippled in the radial\ndirection. Such membranes do not have negative Gaussian curvature and thus will\nnot likely spawn twisted ribbons. We also study the creation of twisted ribbons\nproduced by stretching the edge of a flat membrane in a localized region. In\nexperiments using a pair of optical traps it has been observed that once the\nmembrane has been sufficiently stretched a ribbon forms on the stretched edge.\nWe study this process theoretically using a free energy consisting of the\nHelfrich and edge energies alone. We add a small ribbon-like perturbation to\nthe protrusion producd by stretching and determine whether it is energetically\nfavorable as a function of the size of the protrusion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Feb 2013 15:04:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-23"}

In this paper we investigate a privacy-enhancing technology that aims\nat hindering an attacker in its efforts to accurately profile users based on\nthe items they rate.

For any Boolean function $b:\\{0,1\\}^n\\rightarrow \\{0,1\\}$, we\nconjecture that $I(b(X^n);Y^n)\\leq 1-H(\\alpha)$.

However, determining this\nfor impulsive phase footpoints has been difficult in the past due to\ninsufficient spatial resolution to resolve the footpoints from the loop\nstructures, and a lack of spectral and temporal coverage. We use the\ncapabilities of Hinode/EIS to obtain the first emission measure distributions\n(EMDs) from impulsive phase footpoints in six flares. Observations with good\nspectral coverage were analysed using a regularized inversion method to recover\nthe EMDs. We find that the EMDs all share a peak temperature of around 8 MK,\nwith lines formed around this temperature having emission measures peaking\nbetween 10^28 and 10^29 cm^-5, indicating a substantial presence of plasma at\nvery high temperatures within the footpoints. An EMD gradient of EM(T) ~ T is\nfound in all events. Previous theoretical work on emission measure gradients\nshows this to be consistent with a scenario in which the deposited flare energy\ndirectly heats only the top layer of the flare chromosphere, while deeper\nlayers are heated by conduction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Feb 2013 15:59:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}
