In the present article we\ninvestigate the non-congruence of the nuclear liquid-gas PT at sub-saturation\ndensities and the deconfinement PT at high densities and/or temperatures in\nCoulomb-less models, relevant for heavy-ion collisions and neutron stars. For\nthe first PT, we use the FSUgold relativistic mean-field model and for the\nsecond one the relativistic chiral SU(3) model. The chiral SU(3) model is one\nof the few models for the deconfinement PT, which contains quarks and hadrons\nin arbitrary proportions (i.e. a \"solution\") and gives a continuous transition\nfrom pure hadronic to pure quark matter above a critical point. The study shows\nthe universality of the applied concept of non-congruence for the two PTs with\nan upper critical point, and illustrates the different typical scales involved.\nIn addition, we find a principle difference between the liquid-gas and the\ndeconfinement PTs: in contrast to the ordinary Van-der-Waals-like PT, the phase\ncoexistence line of the deconfinement PT has a negative slope in the\npressure-temperature plane. As another qualitative difference we find that the\nnon-congruent features of the deconfinement PT become vanishingly small around\nthe critical point.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Feb 2013 16:06:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 Jun 2013 18:13:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-22"}

The\nquantum inequalities severely limit the utilization of negative energy to\nproduce gross macroscopic effects, such as violations of the second law of\nthermodynamics. The restrictions on the sampled energy density along the\nworldlines of accelerated observers are much weaker than for inertial\nobservers. Here we will illustrate this with several explicit examples. We\nconsider the worldline of a particle undergoing sinusoidal motion in space in\nthe presence of a single mode squeezed vacuum state of the electromagnetic\nfield. We show that it is possible for the integrated energy density along such\na worldline to become arbitrarily negative at a constant average rate. Thus the\naveraged weak energy condition is violated in these examples.This can be the\ncase even when the particle moves at non-relativistic speeds. We use the\nRaychaudhuri equation to show that there can be net defocussing of a congruence\nof these accelerated worldlines. This defocussing is an operational signature\nof the negative integrated energy density. These results in no way invalidate\nnor undermine either the validity or utility of the quantum inequalities for\ninertial observers. In particular, they do not change previous constraints on\nthe production of macroscopic effects with negative energy, e.g., the\nmaintenance of traversable wormholes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Feb 2013 16:49:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-14"}

We observe a decrease in the\nloop length, width and volume before the X-ray peak, and an increasing number\ndensity and thermal pressure. After the X-ray peak, volume increases and loop\ncorpulence grows due to an increasing width. The volume variations are more\npronounced than the position variations, often known as magnetic line\ncontraction. We believe this is the first dedicated study of the temporal\nevolution of X-ray loop lengths and widths. Collectively, the observations also\nshow for the first time three temporal phases given by peaks in temperature,\nX-ray emission and thermal pressure, with minimum volume coinciding with the\nX-ray peak. Although the volume of the flaring plasma decreases before the peak\nin X-ray emission, the relationship between temperature and volume does not\nsupport simple compressive heating in a collapsing magnetic trap model. Within\na low beta plasma, shrinking loop widths perpendicular to the guiding field can\nbe explained by squeezing the magnetic field threading the region.

We use our well-tested cluster finding algorithm to\nidentify structures in the GOODS North and South fields, exploiting the\navailable spectroscopic redshifts and accurate photometric redshifts. We\nidentify 9 structures in GOODS-south (presented in a previous paper) and 8 new\nstructures in GOODS-north. We only consider structures where at least 2/3 of\nthe members brighter than M_R=-20 have a spectroscopic redshift. For those\ngroup members that coincide with X-ray sources in the 4 and 2 Msec Chandra\nsource catalogs respectively, we determine if the X-ray emission originates\nfrom AGN activity or it is related to the galaxies' star-formation activity. We\nfind that the fraction of AGN with Log L_H > 42 erg/s in galaxies with M_R <\n-20 is on average 6.3+-1.3%, much higher than in lower redshift groups of\nsimilar mass and more than double the fraction found in massive clusters at a\nsimilarly high redshift. We then explore the spatial distribution of AGN in the\nstructures and find that they preferentially populate the outer regions. The\ncolors of AGN host galaxies in structures tend to be confined to the green\nvalley, thus avoiding the blue cloud and, partially, also the red-sequence,\ncontrary to what happens in the field. We finally compare our results to the\npredictions of two sets of semi analytic models to investigate the evolution of\nAGN and evaluate potential triggering and fueling mechanisms. The outcome of\nthis comparison attests the importance of galaxy encounters, not necessarily\nleading to mergers, as an efficient AGN triggering mechanism.

In this study, we explore the\npotential effects of such a boson with family-nonuniversal couplings on the\nleptonic decays of h, both flavor-conserving and flavor-changing.

Violent\nmergers of two carbon--oxygen (CO) white dwarfs (WDs) are one candidate\nsuggested to be responsible for at least a significant fraction of normal SNe\nIa. Here, we simulate the merger of two CO WDs using a moving-mesh code that\nallows for the inclusion of thin helium (He) shells (0.01\\,\\msun) on top of the\nWDs, at an unprecedented numerical resolution. The accretion of He onto the\nprimary WD leads to the formation of a detonation in its He shell. This\ndetonation propagates around the CO WD and sends a converging shock wave into\nits core, known to robustly trigger a second detonation, as in the well-known\ndouble-detonation scenario for\n  He-accreting CO WDs. However, in contrast to that scenario where a massive He\nshell is required to form a detonation through thermal instability, here the He\ndetonation is ignited dynamically. Accordingly the required He-shell mass is\nsignificantly smaller, and hence its burning products are unlikely to affect\nthe optical display of the explosion. We show that this scenario, which works\nfor CO primary WDs with CO- as well as He-WD companions, has the potential to\nexplain the different brightness distributions, delay times and relative rates\nof normal and fast declining SNe Ia.

We\nuse Spitzer/IRAC imaging, Chandra and XMM X-ray imaging, and PRism MUlti-object\nSurvey (PRIMUS) spectroscopic redshifts to construct galaxy and AGN samples at\n0.2<z<1.2 over 8 deg^2. We construct samples over a wide range of IRAC flux\nlimits (SWIRE to GOODS depth) and X-ray flux limits (10 ks to 2 Ms). We compare\nIR-AGN samples defined using the IRAC color selection of Stern et al. and\nDonley et al. with X-ray detected AGN samples. For roughly similar depth IR and\nX-ray surveys, we find that ~75% of IR-AGN are identified as X-ray AGN. This\nfraction increases to ~90% when comparing against the deepest X-ray data,\nindicating that only ~10% of IR-selected AGN may be heavily obscured. The\nIR-AGN selection proposed by Stern et al. suffers from contamination by\nstar-forming galaxies at various redshifts when using deeper IR data, though\nthe selection technique works well for shallow IR data. While similar overall,\nthe IR-AGN samples preferentially contain more luminous AGN, while the X-ray\nAGN samples preferentially contain lower specific accretion rate AGN, where the\nhost galaxy light dominates at IR wavelengths. The host galaxy populations of\nthe IR and X-ray AGN samples have similar restframe colors and stellar masses;\nboth selections identify AGN in blue, star-forming and red, quiescent galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Feb 2013 21:00:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 10 Aug 2013 04:13:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-13"}

Examples include\nultracold atoms, trapped ions, superconducting circuits, and photonic crystals.\nBy design, these systems possess negligible disorder, granting them a high\nlevel of tunability. Conversely, electrons in conventional condensed matter\nsystems exist inside an imperfect host material, subjecting them to\nuncontrollable, random disorder, which often destroys delicate correlated\nphases and precludes local tunability. The realization of a condensed matter\nsystem that is disorder-free and locally-tunable thus remains an outstanding\nchallenge. Here, we demonstrate a new technique for deterministic creation of\nlocally-tunable, ultra-low-disorder electron systems in carbon nanotubes\nsuspended over circuits of unprecedented complexity. Using transport\nexperiments we show that electrons can be localized at any position along the\nnanotube and that the confinement potential can be smoothly moved from location\nto location. Nearly perfect mirror symmetry of transport characteristics about\nthe centre of the nanotube establishes the negligible effects of electronic\ndisorder, thus allowing experiments in precision engineered one-dimensional\npotentials. We further demonstrate the ability to position multiple nanotubes\nat chosen separations, generalizing these devices to coupled one-dimensional\nsystems.

Our most substantial results show how the $D$-topology on\nthe function space $C^{\\infty}(M,N)$ between smooth manifolds compares to other\nwell-known topologies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Feb 2013 22:05:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 May 2013 19:06:42 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 10 Mar 2014 19:01:55 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 16 Sep 2015 19:36:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-17"}

Languages variously employ tones,\nclicks, or manual signs to signal differences in meaning; some languages lack\nthe noun-verb distinction (e.g., Straits Salish), whereas others have a\nproliferation of fine-grained syntactic categories (e.g., Tzeltal); and some\nlanguages do without morphology (e.g., Mandarin), while others pack a whole\nsentence into a single word (e.g., Cayuga). A challenge for evolutionary\nbiology is to reconcile the diversity of languages with the high degree of\nbiological uniformity of their speakers. Here, we model processes of language\nchange and geographical dispersion and find a consistent pressure for flexible\nlearning, irrespective of the language being spoken. This pressure arises\nbecause flexible learners can best cope with the observed high rates of\nlinguistic change associated with divergent cultural evolution following human\nmigration. Thus, rather than genetic adaptations for specific aspects of\nlanguage, such as recursion, the coevolution of genes and fast-changing\nlinguistic structure provides the biological basis for linguistic diversity.\nOnly biological adaptations for flexible learning combined with cultural\nevolution can explain how each child has the potential to learn any human\nlanguage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Feb 2013 22:13:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-14"}

This will provide entirely new opportunities to\nidentify genes related to particular phenotypes. There are, however, three key\nchallenges that must be addressed for such studies to realize their potential.\nFirst, gene expression data must be measured from multiple species, some of\nwhich may be field collected, and parameterized in such a way that they can be\ncompared across species. Second, it will be necessary to develop phylogenetic\ncomparative methods suitable for large multidimensional datasets. In most\nphylogenetic comparative studies to date, the number n of independent\nobservations (independent contrasts) has been greater than the number p of\nvariables (characters). The behavior of comparative methods for these classic\nn>p problems are now well understood under a wide variety of conditions. In\ngene expression studies, and studies based on other high-throughput tools, the\nnumber n of samples is dwarfed by the number p of variables. The estimated\ncovariance matrices will be singular, complicating their analysis and\ninterpretation, and prone to spurious results.

The systems under discussion are:\n(i) four dimensional pure $SU(3)$ Yang-Mills theory, (ii) four dimensional\n$SU(3)$ Yang-Mills with spontaneous symmetry breaking, and (iii) pure\nYang-Mills theory with one universal compact extra dimension. The canonical\ntransformation, that induces the notion of hidden symmetry, maps objects with\nwell defined transformation laws under a gauge group $G$ to well defined\nobjects under a non-trivial subgroup $H \\subset G$. In the case where\nspontaneous symmetry breaking is present, the set of SGTs corresponds to the\ngroup into which the original gauge group is broken into, whereas the NSGTs are\nassociated to the broken generators and can be used to define the unitary\ngauge. For the system (iii), the SGTs coincide with the gauge group $\nSU(N,\\cal{M}^{4}) $, whereas the NSGTs do not form a group; in this system the\n'fundamental' theory and the effective one are shown to be classically\nequivalent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Feb 2013 05:34:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 31 Oct 2013 17:15:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-01"}

The importance of our results lies in the fact that digital phase\nshift keying (PSK) protocols are used in many present-day wireless\ncommunication scenarios, allowing new angular momentum radio implementations to\nuse methods and protocols that are backward compatible with existing linear\nmomentum ones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Feb 2013 06:18:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Feb 2013 13:24:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-18"}

In order to understand the past\nmerging history of EGs, we studied the optical-NIR color gradients of 204 EGs.\nThe use of the optical and the NIR data provides large wavelength baselines,\nand breaks the age-metallicity(Z) degeneracy, allowing us to derive age and Z\ngradients. The use of the deep SDSS Stripe 82 images make it possible for us to\nexamine how the color/age/Z gradients are related to merging features. We find\nthat the optical-NIR color and the age/Z gradients of EGs with tidal features\nare consistent with those of relaxed EGs suggesting that the two populations\nunderwent a similar merging history on average and that mixing of stars was\nmore or less completed before the tidal features disappear. EGs with dust\nfeatures have steeper color gradients than the other two types, even after\nmasking out dust features during the analysis, which can be due to a process\ninvolving wet merging. More importantly, we find that the scatter in the\ncolor/age/Z gradients of the relaxed and merging feature types, decreases as\ntheir luminosities increase at M > 10^{11.4} M_{\\odot} but stays to be large at\nlower luminosities. Mean Z gradients appear nearly constant over the explored\nmass range, but a possible flattening is observed at the massive end. According\nto our toy model that predicts how the distribution of Z gradients changes as a\nresult of major dry merging, the mean Z gradient should flatten by 40% and its\nscatter become smaller by 80% per a mass doubling scale if EGs evolve only\nthrough major dry merger. Our result, although limited by a number statistics\nat the massive end, is consistent with the picture that major dry merging is an\nimportant mechanism for the evolution for EGs at M > 10^{11.4} M_{\\odot}, but\nless important at the lower mass range.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Feb 2013 07:42:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Mar 2013 20:02:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

Vertex identification, which\nidentifies a particular user from a network based on background knowledge such\nas vertex degree, is one of the most important problems that has been\naddressed. In reality, however, each individual in a social network is inclined\nto be associated with not only a vertex identity but also a community identity,\nwhich can represent the personal privacy information sensitive to the public,\nsuch as political party affiliation. This paper first addresses the new privacy\nissue, referred to as community identification, by showing that the community\nidentity of a victim can still be inferred even though the social network is\nprotected by existing anonymity schemes. For this problem, we then propose the\nconcept of \\textit{structural diversity} to provide the anonymity of the\ncommunity identities. The $k$-Structural Diversity Anonymization ($k$-SDA) is\nto ensure sufficient vertices with the same vertex degree in at least $k$\ncommunities in a social network. We propose an Integer Programming formulation\nto find optimal solutions to $k$-SDA and also devise scalable heuristics to\nsolve large-scale instances of $k$-SDA from different perspectives.

We model RDs of GC\npopulations using a simple prescription for a Hubble time of relaxation driven\nevolution of cluster mass and radius, and explore the conditions under which\nthe RD can be used as a standard ruler. We consider a power-law cluster initial\nmass function (CIMF) with and without an exponential truncation, and focus in\nparticular on a flat and a steep CIMF (power-law indices of 0 and -2,\nrespectively). For the initial half-mass radii at birth we adopt either\nRoche-lobe filling conditions ('filling',meaning that the ratio of half-mass to\nJacobi radius is approximately rh/rJ ~ 0.15) or strongly Roche-lobe\nunder-filling conditions ('under-filling', implying that initially rh/rJ <<\n0.15). Assuming a constant orbital velocity about the galaxy centre we find for\na steep CIMF that the typical half-light radius scales with galactocentric\nradius RG as RG^1/3. This weak scaling is consistent with observations, but\nthis scenario has the (well known) problem that too many low-mass clusters\nsurvive. A flat CIMF with 'filling' initial conditions results in the correct\nmass function at old ages, but with too many large (massive) clusters at large\nRG. An 'underfilling' GC population with a flat CIMF also results in the\ncorrect mass function, and can also successfully reproduce the shape of the RD,\nwith a peak size that is (almost) independent of RG. In this case, the peak\nsize depends (almost) only on the peak mass of the GC mass function. The (near)\nuniversality of the GC RD is therefore because of the (near) universality of\nthe CIMF.

Quantum Key Distribution,\nthe working mechanism of quantum repeaters and the various quantum\ncommunication protocols are all based on quantum entanglement. On the other\nhand, quantum entanglement is extremely fragile and sensitive to the noise of\nthe communication channel over which it has been transmitted. To share\nentanglement between distant points, high fidelity quantum channels are needed.\nIn practice, these communication links are noisy, which makes it impossible or\nextremely difficult and expensive to distribute entanglement. In this work we\nfirst show that quantum entanglement can be generated by a new idea, exploiting\nthe most natural effect of the communication channels: the noise itself of the\nlink. We prove that the noise transformation of quantum channels that are not\nable to transmit quantum entanglement can be used to generate distillable\n(useable) entanglement from classically correlated input.

The proposed solution does not require any non-local operation or\nlocal measurement by the parties, only the use of standard quantum channels.\nOur results have implications and consequences for the future of quantum\ncommunications, and for global-scale quantum communication networks.

These systems deserve a close study to estimate rates\nand parameter distribution. This is not an easy task, since the evolution of a\ndense stellar cluster involves the integration of $N$ bodies with high\nresolution in time and space and including hard binaries and their encounters\nand, in the case of gravitational waves (GWs), one needs to take into account\nimportant relativistic corrections. In this work we present the first\nimplementation of the effect of spin in mergers in a direct-summation code,\nNBODY6. We employ non-spinning post-Newtonian corrections to the Newtonian\naccelerations up to 3.5 post-Newtonian (PN) order as well as the spin-orbit\ncoupling up to next-to-lowest order and the lowest order spin-spin coupling. We\nintegrate spin precession and add a consistent treatment of mergers. We analyse\nthe implementation by running a set of two-body experiments and then we run a\nset of 500 simulations of a relativistic stellar cluster. In spite of the large\nnumber of mergers in our tests, the application of the algorithm is robust. We\nfind in particular the formation of a runaway star whose spin decays with the\nmass it wins, independently of the initial value of the spins of the stars.\nMore remarkably, the subset of compact objects that do not undergo many\nmergers, and hence represent a more realistic system, has a correlation between\nthe final absolute spin and the initial choice for the initial distribution,\nwhich could provide us with information about the evolution of spins in dense\nclusters once the first detections have started.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Feb 2013 15:18:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 Mar 2014 13:44:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

Quadratic Mahalanobis metric learning is a popular\napproach to the problem, but typically requires solving a semidefinite\nprogramming (SDP) problem, which is computationally expensive. Standard\ninterior-point SDP solvers typically have a complexity of $O(D^{6.5})$ (with\n$D$ the dimension of input data), and can thus only practically solve problems\nexhibiting less than a few thousand variables. Since the number of variables is\n$D (D+1) / 2 $, this implies a limit upon the size of problem that can\npractically be solved of around a few hundred dimensions. The complexity of the\npopular quadratic Mahalanobis metric learning approach thus limits the size of\nproblem to which metric learning can be applied. Here we propose a\nsignificantly more efficient approach to the metric learning problem based on\nthe Lagrange dual formulation of the problem. The proposed formulation is much\nsimpler to implement, and therefore allows much larger Mahalanobis metric\nlearning problems to be solved. The time complexity of the proposed method is\n$O (D ^ 3) $, which is significantly lower than that of the SDP approach.\nExperiments on a variety of datasets demonstrate that the proposed method\nachieves an accuracy comparable to the state-of-the-art, but is applicable to\nsignificantly larger problems.
