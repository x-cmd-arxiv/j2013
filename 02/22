We find an interesting\ninterrelation between this dynamical symmetry and the separation of energy and\ntime scales: In case of a global excitation with all plaquettes excited, the\ninitial N\\'eel and the initial CDW states are linked by the transformation.\nThis prevents an efficient relaxation of the CDW state on the short time scale\ngoverning the dynamics of charge degrees of freedom.

Gamma\nray bursts (GRB), the most violent explosions in the universe second only to\nthe Big Bang, have been a popular candidate site for UHECR productions. The\nrecent IceCube report on the non-observation of GRB induced neutrinos therefore\nattracts wide attention. This dilemma requires a resolution: either the\nassumption of GRB as UHECR accelerator is to be abandoned or the expected GRB\ninduced neutrino yield was wrong. It has been pointed out that IceCube has\noverestimated the neutrino flux at GRB site by a factor of $\\sim 5$. In this\npaper we point out that, in addition to the issue of neutrino production at\nsource, the neutrino oscillation and the possible neutrino decay during their\nflight from GRB to Earth should further reduce the detectability of IceCube,\nwhich is most sensitive to the muon-neutrino flavor as far as point-source\nidentification is concerned. Specifically, neutrino oscillation will reduce the\nmuon-neutrino flavor ratio from 2/3 per neutrino at GRB source to 1/3 on Earth,\nwhile neutrino decay, if exists and under the assumption of normal hierarchy of\nmass eigenstates, would result in a further reduction of muon-neutrino ratio to\n1/8. With these in mind, we note that there have been efforts in recent years\nin pursuing other type of neutrino telescopes based on Askaryan effect, which\ncan in principle observe and distinguish all three flavors with comparable\nsensitivities. Such new approach may therefore be complementary to IceCube in\nshedding more lights on this cosmic accelerator question.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Feb 2013 16:10:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

Our\nconclusions are of high relevance to the theoretical modelling of epileptic\nseizure events, and indicate that such studies which omit physiological network\nstructure risk simplifying the dynamics in a potentially significant way.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Feb 2013 16:40:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-22"}

An important question that arises often in the context of Markov chain\nis whether the uniform distribution on the vertices of the graph is a\nstationary distribution of the Markov chain. Stationary distribution of a\nMarkov chain is a global property of the graph. In this paper, we prove that\nfor a regular directed graph whether the uniform distribution on the vertices\nof the graph is a stationary distribution, depends on a local property of the\ngraph, namely if (u,v) is an directed edge then outdegree(u) is equal to\nindegree(v).\n  This result also has an application to the problem of testing whether a given\ndistribution is uniform or \"far\" from being uniform. This is a well studied\nproblem in property testing and statistics. If the distribution is the\nstationary distribution of the lazy random walk on a directed graph and the\ngraph is given as an input, then how many bits of the input graph do one need\nto query in order to decide whether the distribution is uniform or \"far\" from\nit? This is a problem of graph property testing and we consider this problem in\nthe orientation model (introduced by Halevy et al.). We reduce this problem to\ntest (in the orientation model) whether a directed graph is Eulerian. And using\nresult of Fischer et al. on query complexity of testing (in the orientation\nmodel) whether a graph is Eulerian, we obtain bounds on the query complexity\nfor testing whether the stationary distribution is uniform.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Feb 2013 18:26:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 Sep 2013 10:05:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 10 Mar 2016 17:00:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-11"}

Our goal is also to provide statistics on the population of giant\nplanets at wide-orbits and discuss planet formation models. We report a deep\nsurvey of 59 stars, members of young stellar associations. The observations\nwere conducted with VLT/NaCo at L'-band (3.8 micron).

One of the particularities of\nthis work lies in the fact that the CSI is distributed in the sense that each\nTX obtains its own estimate of the global multi-user MIMO channel with no\nfurther exchange of information being allowed between the TXs. Although this is\nwell suited to model the cooperation between non-colocated TXs, e.g., in\ncellular Coordinated Multipoint (CoMP) schemes, this type of setting has\nreceived little attention so far in the information theoretic society. We study\nin this work what are the CSI requirements at every TX, as a function of the\nnetwork geometry, to ensure that the maximal number of degrees-of-freedom (DoF)\nis achieved, i.e., the same DoF as obtained under perfect CSI at all TXs. We\nadvocate the use of the generalized DoF to take into account the geometry of\nthe network in the analysis. Consistent with the intuition, the derived DoF\nmaximizing CSI allocation policy suggests that TX cooperation should be limited\nto a specific finite neighborhood around each TX. This is in sharp contrast\nwith the conventional (uniform) CSI dissemination policy which induces CSI\nrequirements that grow unbounded with the network size. The proposed CSI\nallocation policy suggests an alternative to clustering which overcomes\nfundamental limitations such as (i) edge interference and (ii) unbounded\nincrease of the CSIT requirements with the cluster size. Finally, we show how\nfinite neighborhood CSIT exchange translates into finite neighborhood message\nexchange so that finally global interference management is possible with only\nlocal cooperation\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Feb 2013 19:03:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Sep 2013 15:06:46 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 14 Apr 2014 14:10:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-15"}

Nanotubes disorderly\ndistributed in a film offers many possible paths for charge carriers to travel\nacross the entire system, but the theoretical description of how this charge\ntransport occurs is rather challenging for involving a combination of intrinsic\nnanotube properties with network morphology aspects. Here we attempt to\ndescribe the transport properties of such films in two different length scales.\nFirstly, from a purely macroscopic point of view we carry out a geometrical\nanalysis that shows how the network connectivity depends on the nanotube\nconcentration and on their respective aspect ratio. Once this is done, we are\nable to calculate the resistivity of a heavily disordered networked film.\nComparison with experiment offers us a way to infer about the junction\nresistance between neighbouring nanotubes. Furthermore, in order to guide the\nfrantic search for high-conductivity films of nanotube networks, we turn to the\nmicroscopic scale where we have developed a computationally efficient way for\ncalculating the ballistic transport across these networks. While the ballistic\ntransport is probably not capable of describing the observed transport\nproperties of these films, it is undoubtedly useful in establishing an upper\nvalue for their conductivity. This can serve as a guideline in how much room\nthere is for improving the conductivity of such networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Feb 2013 19:23:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-22"}

Alfv\\'en waves have been proposed as the energy\nsource that heats the corona and drives the solar wind. Previous work has shown\nthat line widths decrease with height in coronal holes, which is a signature of\nwave damping, but have been unable to quantify the energy lost by the waves.\nThis is because line widths depend on both the non-thermal velocity v_nt and\nthe ion temperature T_i. We have implemented a means to separate the T_i and\nv_nt contributions using the observation that at low heights the waves are\nundamped and the ion temperatures do not change with height. This enables us to\ndetermine the amount of energy carried by the waves at low heights, which is\nproportional to v_nt. We find the initial energy flux density present was 6.7\n+/- 0.7 x 10^5 erg cm^-2 s^-1, which is sufficient to heat the coronal hole and\nacccelerate the solar wind during the 2007 - 2009 solar minimum. Additionally,\nwe find that about 85% of this energy is dissipated below 1.5 R_sun,\nsufficiently low that thermal conduction can transport the energy throughout\nthe coronal hole, heating it and driving the fast solar wind. The remaining\nenergy is roughly consistent with what models show is needed to provide the\nextended heating above the sonic point for the fast solar wind.

We present a study of five distinct approaches to modelling AGN\nfeedback within gravitohydrodynamic simulations of major mergers of Milky\nWay-sized galaxies. To constrain differences to only be between AGN feedback\nmodels, all simulations start from the same initial conditions and use the same\nstar formation algorithm. Most AGN feedback algorithms have five key aspects:\nblack hole accretion rate, energy feedback rate and method, particle accretion\nalgorithm, black hole advection algorithm, and black hole merger algorithm. All\nmodels follow different accretion histories, with accretion rates that differ\nby up to three orders of magnitude at any given time. We consider models with\neither thermal or kinetic feedback, with the associated energy deposited\nlocally around the black hole. Each feedback algorithm modifies the gas\nproperties near the black hole to different extents. The particle accretion\nalgorithms usually (but not always) maintain good agreement between the mass\naccreted by \\dot{M} dt and the mass of gas particles removed from the\nsimulation. The black hole advection algorithms dampen inappropriate dragging\nof the black holes by two-body interactions. Advecting the black hole a limited\ndistance based upon local mass distributions has many desirably properties. The\nblack holes merge when given criteria are met, and we find a range of merger\ntimes for different criteria. Using the M_{BH}-\\sigma relation as a diagnostic\nof the remnants yields three models that lie within the one-sigma scatter of\nthe observed relation and two that fall below it. The wide variation in\naccretion behaviours of the models reinforces the fact that there remains much\nto be learnt about the evolution of galactic nuclei.

For\ndynamic control, field-induced transparency (FIT) from photo-excited electrons\nin a slit-embedded atomic system show up within a narrow frequency window for\nmodulating the intensity of focused transmitted light in the near-field region.\nBased on the electromagnetic coupling, this is facilitated by surface plasmons\nbetween the two FIT-atom embedded slits. For static control, the role of\nsurface curvature is obtained for focused transmitted light passing through a\nGaussian-shaped metallic microlens embedded with a linear array of slits, in\naddition to a negative light-refraction pattern, which is associated with\nhigher-diffraction modes of light, under a large angle of incidence in the\nnear-field region.

The dust masses\nderived from these observations assume that all the grains of a given species\nradiate at the same temperature, regardless of the dust heating mechanism or\ngrain radius. In this paper, we derive the dust mass in the ejecta of the Crab\nNebula, using a physical model for the heating and radiation from the dust. We\nadopt a power-law distribution of grain sizes and two different dust\ncompositions (silicates and amorphous carbon), and calculate the heating rate\nof each dust grain by the radiation from the pulsar wind nebula (PWN). We find\nthat the grains attain a continuous range of temperatures, depending on their\nsize and composition. The total mass derived from the best-fit models to the\nobserved IR spectrum is 0.019-0.13 solar masses, depending on the assumed grain\ncomposition. We find that the power-law size distribution of dust grains is\ncharacterized by a power-law index of 3.5-4.0 and a maximum grain size larger\nthan 0.1 microns. The grain sizes and composition are consistent with what is\nexpected for dust grains formed in a Type IIP SN. Our derived dust mass is at\nleast a factor of two less than the mass reported in previous studies of the\nCrab Nebula that assumed more simplified two-temperature models. The results of\nthis study show that a physical model resulting in a realistic distribution of\ndust temperatures can constrain the dust properties and affect the derived dust\nmasses. Our study may also have important implications for deriving grain\nproperties and mass estimates in other SNRs and for the ultimate question of\nwhether SNe are major sources of dust in the Galactic interstellar medium (ISM)\nand in external galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Feb 2013 23:28:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 Jul 2013 19:22:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

The driving force is the Kondo effect, which leads to a\nnon-linear dependence on the filling of the lattice site for the energy gain.\nWe use dynamical mean field theory combined with numerical renormalization\ngroup to demonstrate the existence of charge order at quarter filling for a\nKondo lattice model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Feb 2013 02:21:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 Apr 2013 22:56:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-29"}

In this regime, perturbing the\nmagnitudes of the frame coefficients by noise that is sufficiently small\nresults in a recovery error that is at most proportional to the noise level.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Feb 2013 05:35:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-25"}

Different coding\ntechniques have been proposed to provide the required redundancy more\nefficiently than traditional replication schemes. However, compared to\nreplication, coding techniques are less efficient for repairing lost\nredundancy, as they require retrieval of larger amounts of data from larger\nsubsets of storage nodes. To mitigate these problems, several recent works have\npresented locally repairable codes designed to minimize the repair traffic and\nthe number of nodes involved per repair. Unfortunately, existing methods often\nlead to codes where there is only one subset of nodes able to repair a piece of\nlost data, limiting the local repairability to the availability of the nodes in\nthis subset. In this paper, we present a new family of locally repairable codes\nthat allows different trade-offs between the number of contacted nodes per\nrepair, and the number of different subsets of nodes that enable this repair.\nWe show that slightly increasing the number of contacted nodes per repair\nallows to have repair alternatives, which in turn increases the probability of\nbeing able to perform efficient repairs. Finally, we present pg-BLRC, an\nexplicit construction of locally repairable codes with multiple repair\nalternatives, constructed from partial geometries, in particular from\nGeneralized Quadrangles.

This\nself-similar prior characterizes accurately second-order statistics of velocity\nfields in incompressible isotropic turbulence. Nevertheless, the associated\nmaximum a posteriori involves a fractional Laplacian operator which is delicate\nto implement in practice. To deal with this issue, we propose to decompose the\ndivergent-free fBm on well-chosen wavelet bases. As a first alternative, we\npropose to design wavelets as whitening filters. We show that these filters are\nfractional Laplacian wavelets composed with the Leray projector. As a second\nalternative, we use a divergence-free wavelet basis, which takes implicitly\ninto account the incompressibility constraint arising from physics. Although\nthe latter decomposition involves correlated wavelet coefficients, we are able\nto handle this dependence in practice.

In this paper we show that when discretized time is used to\nmodel the motion of the agent, it can be very important to do \"clipping\" on the\nmotion of the agent in the final time step of the trajectory. By clipping we\nmean that the final time step of the trajectory is to be truncated such that\nthe agent stops exactly at the first terminal state reached, and no distance\nfurther. We demonstrate that when clipping is omitted, learning performance can\nfail to reach the optimum; and when clipping is done properly, learning\nperformance can improve significantly.\n  The clipping problem we describe affects algorithms which use explicit\nderivatives of the model functions of the environment to calculate a learning\ngradient. These include Backpropagation Through Time for Control, and methods\nbased on Dual Heuristic Dynamic Programming. However the clipping problem does\nnot significantly affect methods based on Heuristic Dynamic Programming,\nTemporal Differences or Policy Gradient Learning algorithms. Similarly, the\nclipping problem does not affect fixed-length finite-horizon problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Feb 2013 12:11:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-25"}

The eigenstates can undergo bifurcations in such a way that two or\nmore eigenvalues and the corresponding wave functions coalesce at critical\nvalues of external parameters. E.g. in condensates without long-range\ninteractions a stable and an unstable state are created in a tangent\nbifurcation when the scattering length of the contact interaction is varied. At\nthe critical point the coalescing states show the properties of an exceptional\npoint. In dipolar condensates fingerprints of a pitchfork bifurcation have been\ndiscovered by Rau et al. [Phys. Rev. A, 81:031605(R), 2010]. We present a\nmethod to uncover all states participating in a pitchfork bifurcation, and\ninvestigate in detail the signatures of exceptional points related to\nbifurcations in dipolar condensates. For the perturbation by two parameters,\nviz. the scattering length and a parameter breaking the cylindrical symmetry of\nthe harmonic trap, two cases leading to different characteristic eigenvalue and\neigenvector patterns under cyclic variations of the parameters need to be\ndistinguished. The observed structures resemble those of three coalescing\neigenfunctions obtained by Demange and Graefe [J. Phys. A, 45:025303, 2012]\nusing perturbation theory for non-Hermitian operators in a linear model.\nFurthermore, the splitting of the exceptional point under symmetry breaking in\neither two or three branching singularities is examined. Characteristic\nfeatures are observed when one, two, or three exceptional points are encircled\nsimultaneously.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Feb 2013 15:08:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-08"}

The key to this construction is\nthat the angular decomposition is an isometry, whereby the new collection of\nwavelets maintains the frame bounds of the original one.

Surprisingly, given the many astronomical hypotheses and\nspeculations that have been offered in the intervening 130 years, there have\nbeen remarkably few attempts to reaffirm or improve on the basic survey data\nconcerning the primary orientations.\n  This paper presents the results of a week-long Total Station survey\nundertaken by the authors during December 2006 whose principal aim was to\nclarify the basic data concerning the orientation of each side of the three\nlarge pyramids and to determine, as accurately as possible, the orientations of\nas many as possible of the associated structures. The principal difference\nbetween this and all previous surveys is that it focuses upon measurements of\nsequences of points along multiple straight and relatively well preserved\nstructural segments, with best-fit techniques being used to provide the best\nestimate of their orientation, as opposed to simple triangulation between\ndirectly identified or extrapolated corners.\n  Our results suggest that there is only a very slight difference in\norientation (c. 0.5 arc minutes) between the north-south axes of Khufu's and\nKhafre's pyramids, that the sides of Khafre's are more perfectly perpendicular\nthan those of Khufu's, and that the east-west axis is closer to true\ncardinality in both cases.

In many modern applications, such as population genetics, it is\nnot possible to apply standard methods based on evaluating the likelihood\nfunctions of the models, as these are numerically intractable.
