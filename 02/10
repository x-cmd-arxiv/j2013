Instead of\ninvoking ad hoc correlations between the various components, the system of\nscalar inhomogeneities is diagonalized in terms of two gauge-invariant\nquasi-normal modes whose weighted sum gives the curvature perturbations on\ncomoving orthogonal hypersurfaces. The predominance of the conventional\nadiabatic scalar mode implies that the growth rate of magnetized\ninhomogeneities must not exceed 2.2 in Hubble units if the conventional\ninflationary phase is to last about 70 efolds and for a range of slow roll\nparameters between 0.1 and 0.001. Longer and shorter durations of the quasi-de\nSitter stage lead, respectively, either to tighter or to looser bounds which\nare anyway more constraining than the standard backreaction demands imposed on\nthe gauge sector. Since a critical growth rate of order 2 leads to a quasi-flat\nmagnetic energy spectrum, the upper bounds on the growth rate imply a lower\nbound on the magnetic spectral index. The advantages of the uniform curvature\ngauge are emphasized and specifically exploited throughout the treatment of the\nmulticomponent system characterizing this class of problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Feb 2013 16:15:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

We study such theories in specific\ncases given for instance by cosmological scenarios: we find that in such\nbackground the Dirac equation admits solutions that are not Dirac spinor\nfields, but in fact the aforementioned flag-dipoles ones. These solutions are\nimportant from a theoretical perspective, as they evince that spinor fields are\nnot necessarily determined by their dynamics, but also a discussion on their\nstructural (algebraic) properties must be carried off. Furthermore, the\nphenomenological point of view is shown to be also relevant, since for\nisotropic Universes they circumvent the question whether spinor fields do\nundergo the Cosmological Principle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Feb 2013 19:45:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Oct 2013 21:04:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-31"}

The resonant parametric instability is a well-known\nform of three-wave interaction in which a primary wave of frequency $\\omega_a$\nexcites a pair of secondary waves of frequency $\\omega_b+\\omega_c \\simeq\n\\omega_a$. Here we consider a nonresonant form of three-wave interaction in\nwhich a low-frequency primary wave excites a high-frequency p-mode and a\nlow-frequency g-mode such that $\\omega_b+\\omega_c >>\\omega_a$. We show that a\np-mode can couple so strongly to a g-mode of similar radial wavelength that\nthis type of interaction is unstable even if the primary wave amplitude is\nsmall. As an application, we analyze the stability of the tide in coalescing\nneutron star binaries to p-g mode coupling. We find that the equilibrium tide\nand dynamical tide are both p-g unstable at gravitational wave frequencies\nf_{gw} > 20 Hz and drive p-g pairs to significant energies on very short\ntimescales (much less than the orbital decay time). Resonant parametric\ncoupling to the tide is, by contrast, either stable or drives modes at a much\nsmaller rate. We do not solve for the saturation of the instability and\ntherefore cannot say precisely how it influences neutron star binaries.\nHowever, we show that if even a single daughter mode saturates near its wave\nbreaking amplitude, the p-g instability of the equilibrium tide: (i) induces\nsignificant orbital phase errors ($\\Delta \\phi$ > 1 radian) that accumulate\nprimarily at low frequencies (f_{gw} < 50 Hz) and (ii) heats the neutron star\ncore to T~10^{10} K. Since there are >100 unstable daughters, $\\Delta \\phi$ and\nT are potentially much larger than these values. Tides might therefore\nsignificantly influence the gravitational wave signal and electromagnetic\nemission from neutron star binaries at much larger orbital separations than\npreviously thought.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Feb 2013 02:42:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 25 Sep 2015 21:11:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-29"}

The giant planets migrated significant distances to reach their current\nlocations, and evidence of that migration's influence on the Solar system\nabounds. That migration's pace, and the distance over which it occurred, is\nstill heavily debated. Some models feature systems in which the giant planets\nwere initially in an extremely compact configuration, in which Uranus and\nNeptune are chaotically scattered into the outer Solar system. Others feature\narchitectures that were initially more relaxed, and smoother, more sedate\nmigration. To determine which of these scenarios best represents the formation\nof our Solar system, we must turn to the structure of the system's small body\npopulations, in which the scars of that migration are still clearly visible.\n  We present the first results of a program investigating the effect of giant\nplanet migration on the reservoirs of small bodies that existed at that time.\nAs the planets migrate, they stir these reservoirs, scattering vast numbers of\nsmall bodies onto dynamically unstable orbits in the outer Solar system. The\ngreat majority of those bodies are rapidly removed from the system, through\ncollisions and ejections, but a small number become captured as planetary\nTrojans or irregular satellites. Others are driven by the migration, leading to\na significant sculpting of the asteroid belt and trans-Neptunian region.\n  The capture and retention efficiencies to these stable reservoirs depend on\nthe particular migration scenario used. Advocates of chaotic migration from an\ninitially compact scenario argue that smoother, more sedate migration cannot\nexplain the observed populations of Trojans and irregular satellites. Our\nresults draw a strikingly different picture, revealing that such smooth\nmigration is perfectly capable of reproducing the observed populations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Feb 2013 08:02:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-12"}

We found that the tidal\nforces supply significant accelerations and result in anisotropic winds. An\nimportant effect of the tidal forces is that it severely depresses the outflow\nof particles near the polar regions. As a consequence, most particles escape\nthe surface of the planet from the regions of low-latitude. Comparing the tidal\nand non-tidal locking cases, we found that their optical depths are very\ndifferent so that the flows also emerge with a different pattern. In the case\nof the non-tidal locking, the radial velocities at the base of the wind are\nhigher than the meridional velocities. However, in the case of tidal locking,\nthe meridional velocities dominate the flow at the base of the wind, and they\ncan transfer effectively mass and energy from the day sides to the night sides.\nFurther, we also found that the differences of the winds show middle extent at\nlarge radii. It expresses that the structure of the wind at the base can be\nchanged by the two-dimensional radiative transfer due to large optical depths,\nbut the extent is reduced with an increase in radius. Because the escape is\ndepressed in the polar regions, the mass loss rate predicted by the non-tidal\nlocking model, in the order of magnitude of $10^{10}$ g s$^{-1}$, is a factor\nof 2 lower than that predicted by one-dimensional hydrodynamic model. The\nresults of tidal locking show that the mass loss rate is decreased a order of\nmagnitude, only 4.3$\\times$ $10^{9}$ g s$^{-1}$, due to large optical depths on\nthe night side.

Here we examine how the\ndrifting subpulses of PSR B0809+74 evolve with time and observing frequency. We\nshow that the subpulse period (P3) is constant on timescales of days, months\nand years, and between 14-5100 MHz. Despite this, the shapes of the driftbands\nchange radically with frequency. Previous studies have concluded that, while\nthe subpulses appear to move through the pulse window approximately linearly at\nlow frequencies (< 500 MHz), a discrete step of 180 degrees in subpulse phase\nis observed at higher frequencies (> 820 MHz) near to the peak of the average\npulse profile. We use LOFAR, GMRT, GBT, WSRT and Effelsberg 100-m data to\nexplore the frequency-dependence of this phase step. We show that the size of\nthe subpulse phase step increases gradually, and is observable even at low\nfrequencies. We attribute the subpulse phase step to the presence of two\nseparate driftbands, whose relative arrival times vary with frequency - one\ndriftband arriving 30 pulses earlier at 20 MHz than it does at 1380 MHz, whilst\nthe other arrives simultaneously at all frequencies. The drifting pattern which\nis observed here cannot be explained by either the rotating carousel model or\nthe surface oscillation model, and could provide new insight into the physical\nprocesses happening within the pulsar magnetosphere.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Feb 2013 11:19:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-26"}

One reason is\nthat discrete channel inputs, such as quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM)\nsignals, instead of Gaussian channel inputs, are deployed in current practical\nwireless systems to maintain moderate peak transmission power and receiver\ncomplexity. In this paper, we investigate the power allocation and artificial\nnoise design for OFDM wiretap channels with discrete channel inputs. We first\nprove that the secrecy rate function for discrete channel inputs is nonconcave\nwith respect to the transmission power. To resolve the corresponding nonconvex\nsecrecy rate maximization problem, we develop a low-complexity power allocation\nalgorithm, which yields a duality gap diminishing in the order of\nO(1/\\sqrt{N}), where N is the number of subcarriers of OFDM. We then show that\nindependent frequency-domain artificial noise cannot improve the secrecy rate\nof single-antenna wiretap channels. Towards this end, we propose a novel\ntime-domain artificial noise design which exploits temporal degrees of freedom\nprovided by the cyclic prefix of OFDM systems {to jam the eavesdropper and\nboost the secrecy rate even with a single antenna at the transmitter}.\nNumerical results are provided to illustrate the performance of the proposed\ndesign schemes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Feb 2013 13:52:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 26 Apr 2013 21:13:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-18"}

For measurement matrices with Gaussian\ni.i.d entries, it known that if $X_0$ is of low rank, it is recoverable from\njust a few measurements. A popular approach for matrix recovery is Nuclear Norm\nMinimization (NNM). Empirical work reveals a \\emph{phase transition} curve,\nstated in terms of the undersampling fraction $\\delta(n,M,N) = n/(MN)$, rank\nfraction $\\rho=r/N$ and aspect ratio $\\beta=M/N$. Specifically, a curve\n$\\delta^* = \\delta^*(\\rho;\\beta)$ exists such that, if $\\delta >\n\\delta^*(\\rho;\\beta)$, NNM typically succeeds, while if $\\delta <\n\\delta^*(\\rho;\\beta)$, it typically fails. An apparently quite different\nproblem is matrix denoising in Gaussian noise, where an unknown $M$ by $N$\nmatrix $X_0$ is to be estimated based on direct noisy measurements $Y = X_0 +\nZ$, where the matrix $Z$ has iid Gaussian entries. It has been empirically\nobserved that, if $X_0$ has low rank, it may be recovered quite accurately from\nthe noisy measurement $Y$.

In this\nstudy, we infer a constraint on one of the three free parameters of the model,\nnamely the one characterising the coupling constants at unification, by\nlinearising the field equations in the limit of weak gravitational fields\ngenerated by a rotating gravitational source, and by making use of recent\nexperimental data. In particular, using data obtained by Gravity Probe B, we\nset a lower bound on the Weyl term appearing in the noncommutative spectral\naction, namely $\\beta \\gtrsim 10^{-6}$m$^{-1}$.

The robust optimization procedure adjusts the parameters of\na rank-reduction matrix, a reduced-rank beamformer and the diagonal loading in\nan alternating manner. LCMV expressions are developed for the design of the\nrank-reduction matrix and the reduced-rank beamformer. Stochastic gradient and\nrecursive least-squares adaptive algorithms are then devised for an efficient\nimplementation of the RJIO robust beamforming technique.

We first note that the curve itself is\nnot uniquely determined from these measurements. However, we find that a curve\ndetermines a measure on projective space which, as a function on Borel subsets\nof projective space, returns the length of curve parallel to elements of the\nset. We show that the projected length data can be expressed as the cosine\ntransform of this measure on projective space. The cosine transform is a well\nstudied integral transform on the sphere which is known to be injective. We\nconclude that the measured length data uniquely determines the associated\nmeasure on projective space. We then characterize the class of curves that\nproduce a common measure by starting with the case of piecewise linear curves\nand then passing to limits to obtain results for more general curves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Feb 2013 15:50:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-12"}
