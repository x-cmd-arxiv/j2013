Final version!","journal-ref":null,"doi":null,"report-no":null,"categories":"math.DG","license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","abstract":"  In classical curve theory, the geometry of a curve in three dimensions is\nessentially characterized by their invariants, curvature and torsion. When they\nare given, the problem of finding a corresponding curve is known as 'solving\nnatural equations'. Explicit solutions are known only for a handful of curve\nclasses, including notably the plane curves and general helices.\n  This paper shows constructively how to solve the natural equations explicitly\nfor an infinite series of curve classes. For every Frenet curve, a family of\nsuccessor curves can be constructed which have the tangent of the original\ncurve as principal normal. Helices are exactly the successor curves of plane\ncurves and applying the successor transformation to helices leads to slant\nhelices, a class of curves that has received considerable attention in recent\nyears as a natural extension of the concept of general helices.\n  The present paper gives for the first time a generic characterization of the\nslant helix in three-dimensional Euclidian space in terms of its curvature and\ntorsion, and derives an explicit arc-length parametrization of its tangent\nvector. These results expand on and put into perspective earlier work on\nSalkowski curves and curves of constant precession, both of which are\nsubclasses of the slant helix.\n  The paper also, for the benefit of novices and teachers, provides a novel and\ngeneralized presentation of the theory of Frenet curves, which is not\nrestricted to curves with positive curvature. Bishop frames are examined along\nwith Frenet frames and Darboux frames as a useful tool in the theory of space\ncurves. The closed curve problem receives attention as well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Feb 2013 17:50:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Feb 2013 16:02:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 16 Mar 2013 21:23:24 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 3 Jul 2013 15:35:58 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sun, 12 Oct 2014 02:36:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-14"}

From\ncurrent-voltage measurements, we find that the Schottky Barrier height (SBH) at\nthe LSMO/Nb:STO interface decreases at low temperatures accompanied by a larger\nthan unity ideality factor. This is ascribed to the tunneling dominated\ntransport caused by the narrowing of the depletion width at the interface.\nHowever, BEEM studies of such unbiased interfaces, do not exhibit SBH lowering\nat low temperatures, implying that this is triggered by the modification of the\ninterface due to an applied bias and is not an intrinsic property of the\ninterface.

We analyze robustness to uncertainty of consensus in\nempirical data from multiple starling flocks and show that the flock\ninteraction networks with six or seven neighbors optimize the trade-off between\ngroup cohesion and individual effort. We can distinguish these numbers of\nneighbors from fewer or greater numbers using our systems-theoretic approach to\nmeasuring robustness of interaction networks as a function of the network\nstructure, i.e., who is sensing whom. The metric quantifies the disagreement\nwithin the network due to disturbances and noise during consensus behavior and\ncan be evaluated over a parameterized family of hypothesized sensing strategies\n(here the parameter is number of neighbors). We use this approach to further\nshow that for the range of flocks studied the optimal number of neighbors does\nnot depend on the number of birds within a flock; rather, it depends on the\nshape, notably the thickness, of the flock. The results suggest that robustness\nto uncertainty may have been a factor in the evolution of flocking for\nstarlings. More generally, our results elucidate the role of the interaction\nnetwork on uncertainty management in collective behavior, and motivate the\napplication of our approach to other biological networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Feb 2013 19:26:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-14"}

Any biophysical size-regulation scheme operates in a noisy\nenvironment and must be robust to other cellular dynamics and fluctuations.\nThis work develops theory of filament length regulation inspired by recent\nexperiments on kinesin-8 motor proteins, which move with directional bias on\nmicrotubule filaments and alter microtubule dynamics. Purified kinesin-8 motors\ncan depolymerize chemically-stabilized microtubules. In the length-dependent\ndepolymerization model, the rate of depolymerization tends to increase with\nfilament length, because long filaments accumulate more motors at their tips\nand therefore shorten more quickly. When balanced with a constant filament\ngrowth rate, this mechanism can lead to a fixed polymer length. However, the\nmechanism by which kinesin-8 motors affect the length of dynamic microtubules\nin cells is less clear. We study the more biologically realistic problem of\nmicrotubule dynamic instability modulated by a motor-dependent increase in the\nfilament catastrophe frequency. This leads to a significant decrease in the\nmean filament length and a narrowing of the filament length distribution. The\nresults improve our understanding of the biophysics of length regulation in\ncells.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Feb 2013 19:28:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-21"}

This induces\na spontaneous compactification to four space-time dimensions and breaks the\nsupersymmetry from N=2 to N=1, which allows the reduced theory to have a\nfour-dimensional chiral spectrum. We perform the reduction explicitly and\nderive the N=1 characteristic data of the four-dimensional effective theory.\nThe match with fourfold reductions of F-theory is discussed and many of the\ncharacteristic features are compared.

The wakes, which are excited by the planets, are damped by\nshocks similar to the wake damping in inviscid hydrodynamic (HD) disks. Angular\nmomentum deposition by shock damping opens gaps in both MHD turbulent disks and\ninviscid HD disks even for low mass planets, in contradiction to the \"thermal\ncriterion\" for gap opening. To test the \"viscous criterion\", we compared gap\nproperties in MRI-turbulent disks to those in viscous HD disks having the same\nstress, and found that the same mass planet opens a significantly deeper and\nwider gap in net vertical flux MHD disks than in viscous HD disks. This\ndifference arises due to the efficient magnetic field transport into the gap\nregion in MRI disks, leading to a larger effective \\alpha within the gap. Thus,\nacross the gap, the Maxwell stress profile is smoother than the gap density\nprofile, and a deeper gap is needed for the Maxwell stress gradient to balance\nthe planetary torque density. We also confirmed the large excess torque close\nto the planet in MHD disks, and found that long-lived density features (termed\nzonal flows) produced by the MRI can affect planet migration. The comparison\nwith previous results from net toroidal flux/zero flux MHD simulations\nindicates that the magnetic field geometry plays an important role in the gap\nopening process. Overall, our results suggest that gaps can be commonly\nproduced by low mass planets in realistic protoplanetary disks, and caution the\nuse of a constant \\alpha-viscosity to model gaps in protoplanetary disks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Feb 2013 21:10:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

It is well known that\nmatching the subhalos to the observed properties of luminous satellites of\ngalaxies in the local universe poses a significant challenge to our\nunderstanding of the astrophysics of galaxy formation. We show that the cosmic\nevolution and host mass dependence of the luminosity function of satellites\nprovides a powerful new diagnostic to disentangle astrophysical effects from\nvariations in the underlying dark matter mass function. We illustrate this by\ncomparing the results of recent observations of satellites out to $z=0.8$ based\non Hubble Space Telescope images with the predictions of three different sets\nof state-of-the art semi-analytic models with underlying CDM power spectra and\none semi-analytic model with an underlying Warm Dark Matter (WDM) power\nspectrum. We find that even though CDM models provide a reasonable fit to the\nlocal luminosity function of satellites around galaxies comparable or slightly\nlarger than the Milky Way, they do not reproduce the data as well for different\nredshift and host galaxy stellar mass. This tension indicates that further\nimprovements are likely to be needed in the description of star formation if\nthe models are to be reconciled with the data. The WDM model matches the\nobserved mass dependence and redshift evolution of satellite galaxies more\nclosely than any of the CDM models, indicating that a modification of the\nunderlying power spectrum may offer an alternative solution to this tension. We\nconclude by presenting predictions for the color magnitude relation of\nsatellite galaxies to demonstrate how future observations will be able to\nfurther distinguish between these models and help constrain baryonic and\nnon-baryonic physics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Feb 2013 21:15:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 May 2013 19:38:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

In this paper, we propose a new approach toward\nbetter queueing and delay performance, based on our observation that the\nalgorithm needs not be Markovian, as long as it can be implemented in a\ndistributed manner, achieve the same throughput optimality, while offering far\nbetter delay performance for general network topologies. Our approach hinges\nupon utilizing past state information observed by local link and then\nconstructing a high-order Markov chain for the evolution of the feasible link\nschedules. We show in theory and simulation that our proposed algorithm, named\ndelayed CSMA, adds virtually no additional overhead onto the existing\nCSMA-based algorithms, achieves the throughput optimality under the usual\nchoice of link weight as a function of local queue length, and also provides\nmuch better delay performance by effectively `de-correlating' the link state\nprocess (thus removing link starvation) under any arbitrary network topology.\nFrom our extensive simulations we observe that the delay under our algorithm\ncan be often reduced by a factor of 20 over a wide range of scenarios, compared\nto the standard Glauber-dynamics-based CSMA algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Feb 2013 21:39:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Mar 2013 22:54:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 17 Jun 2013 02:26:33 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 31 Jul 2013 17:30:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-01"}

We introduce a process\n\"ground state alignment\" as a new way to determine the magnetic field direction\nin diffuse medium. The alignment is due to anisotropic radiation impinging on\nthe atom/ion. The consequence of the process is the polarization of spectral\nlines resulting from scattering and absorption from aligned atomic/ionic\nspecies with fine or hyperfine structure. The magnetic field induces precession\nand realign the atom/ion and therefore the polarization of the emitted or\nabsorbed radiation reflects the direction of the magnetic field. The atoms get\naligned at their low levels and, as the life-time of the atoms/ions we deal\nwith is long, the alignment induced by anisotropic radiation is susceptible to\nextremely weak magnetic fields ($1{\\rm G}\\gtrsim B\\gtrsim 10^{-15}$G). In fact,\nthe effects of atomic/ionic alignment were studied in the laboratory decades\nago, mostly in relation to the maser research. Recently, the atomic effect has\nbeen already detected in observations from circumstellar medium and this is a\nharbinger of future extensive magnetic field studies.

Fossae, foramina and chambers in the postcranial skeletons\nof pterosaurs and saurischian dinosaurs are diagnostic for pneumaticity. In\nbasal saurischians only the cervical skeleton is pneumatized, by cervical air\nsacs. In more derived saurischians pneumatization of posterior dorsal, sacral,\nand caudal vertebrae indicates abdominal air sacs. Abdominal air sacs in\nsauropods are also indicated by a pneumatic hiatus (a gap in vertebral\npneumatization) in Haplocanthosaurus. Minimally, saurischians had dorsally\nattached diverticular lungs plus anterior and posterior air sacs, and all the\npulmonary prerequisites for flow-through lung ventilation like that of birds.\nPneumaticity reduced skeletal mass in saurischians. I propose the Air Space\nProportion (ASP) as a measure of proportional volume of air in pneumatic bones.\nThe mean ASP of a sample of sauropod and theropod vertebrae is 0.61, so on\naverage, air occupied more than half the volume of these vertebrae.

The\norigin of the atomic hydrogen cloud has been debated ever since. Therefore, we\nhave carried out a global investigation of the atomic hydrogen cloud taking\ninto account all possible sources: 1) the Saturnian atmosphere, 2) the H2\natmosphere of main rings, 3) Enceladus H2O and OH torus, 4) Titan H2 torus and\n5) the atomic hydrogen directly escaping from Titan. We show that the H\nejection velocity and angle distribution are modified by collisions of the hot\nH, produced by electron-impact dissociation of H2, with the ambient atmospheric\nH2 and H. This in turn affects the morphology of the escaping hydrogen as does\nthe morphology of the ionospheric electron distribution. That Saturn atmosphere\nis an important source is suggested by the fact that the H cloud peaks well\nbelow the ring plane, a feature that, so far, we can not reproduce by the\ndissociation of the ring H2 atmosphere or other proposed sources. Our\nsimulations show that H directly escaping from Titan is a major contribution in\nthe outer magnetosphere. The morphology of Titan H torus, shaped by the solar\nradiation pressure and the Saturnian oblateness, can account for the local time\nasymmetry near Titan orbit. Dissociation of H2O and OH in the Enceladus torus\ncontributes inside ~5 RS, but dissociation of Titan H2 torus does not due to\nthe significant energy released. The total number of H observed by Cassini\ninside 5 RS: our modeling results suggest ~20% from dissociation in the\nEnceladus torus, ~10% from dissociation of ring H2 atmosphere, and ~50% from\nTitan H torus implying that ~20% comes from the Saturnian atmosphere.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Feb 2013 22:55:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

The numerical model includes collisional transport,\ninteraction and reactions between the species, and optically thin radiative\nlosses. This model improves upon our previous work in Leake et al. 2012\n\\cite{Leake2012} by considering realistic chromospheric transport coefficients,\nand by solving a generalized Ohm's law that accounts for finite ion-inertia and\nelectron-neutral drag.\n  We find that during the two dimensional reconnection of a Harris current\nsheet with an initial width larger than the neutral-ion collisional coupling\nscale, the current sheet thins until its width becomes less than this coupling\nscale, and the neutral and ion fluids decouple upstream from the reconnection\nsite. During this process of decoupling, we observe reconnection faster than\nthe single-fluid Sweet-Parker prediction, with recombination and plasma outflow\nboth playing a role in determining the reconnection rate.\n  As the current sheet thins further and elongates it becomes unstable to the\nsecondary tearing instability, and plasmoids are seen.

The\nfrequency of these waves, measured in the MGS reference frame (SC), is close to\nthe local proton cyclotron frequency. Minimum variance analysis (MVA) shows\nthat these 'proton cyclotron frequency' waves (PCWs) are characterized - in the\nSC frame - by a left-hand, elliptical polarization and propagate almost\nparallel to the background magnetic field. They also have a small degree of\ncompressibility and an amplitude that decreases with the increase of the\ninterplanetary magnetic field (IMF) cone angle and radial distance from the\nplanet. The latter result supports the idea that the source of these waves is\nMars. In addition, we find that these waves are not associated with the\nforeshock .

Whereas the\nGegenschein morphology changed according to the orbital motion of the Earth,\nthe maximum brightness coincided with the antisolar direction throughout the\nyear. We compared the observed morphology of the Gegenschein with those of\nmodels in which the spatial density of the interplanetary dust cloud was\nconsidered and found that the volume scattering phase function had a narrow\nbackscattering enhancement. The morphology was reproducible with a spatial\ndistribution model for infrared zodiacal emission. It is likely that the\nzero-phase peak (the so-called opposition effect) was caused by coherent\nbackscattering and/or shadow-hiding effects on the rough surfaces of individual\ndust particles. These results suggest that big particles are responsible for\nboth zodiacal light and zodiacal emission. Finally, we derived the geometric\nalbedo of the smooth component of interplanetary dust, assuming big particles,\nand obtained a geometric albedo of 0.06+-0.01. The derived albedo is in\naccordance with collected dark micrometeorites and observed cometary dust\nparticles. We concluded that chondritic particles are dominant near Earth\nspace, supporting the recent theoretical study by dynamical simulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Feb 2013 05:40:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

The\narbitrariness in choosing a suitable kernel in the conventional broadening\napproach is thereby removed and, furthermore, we find that the Pad\\'e method is\nable to resolve fine details in spectral functions with less artifacts on the\nscale of omega ~ T.

For\nthe Hubbard model, we discuss the inner structure of the Hubbard bands in\nmetallic and insulating solutions at half-filling, as well as in the doped Mott\ninsulator. Based on these test cases we conclude that the Pad\\'e approximant\napproach provides more reliable results for spectral functions at low-frequency\nscales of omega < T and that it is capable of resolving sharp spectral features\nalso at high frequencies.

Caused by the expansion of the universe, the\ntime-dependence of a magnetic field induces (in accordance with the Faraday\nlaw) the emergence of source-free electric fields. In comparison with the\nFriedmann models, the cosmological expansion goes with acceleration in spatial\ndirections across the magnetic field, and with deceleration along the magnetic\nlines, so that in flat and open models, in fluid comoving coordinates, the\nlengths of $\\varphi$-circles of large enough radius or for late enough times\ndecrease and vanish for $t\\to\\infty$.

After a description of the\nproperties and cosmological aims of Planck, we review the results obtained\nduring the first 1.6 full sky surveys relative to compact extragalactic sources\nand their implications. The most recent and efficient methods and filters for\ncompact source detection in the presence of Gaussian noise and CMB anisotropies\nare discussed. The first surveys of Planck have enabled the detection of about\n200 galaxy clusters, by the SZ effect, and from several hundreds to many\nthousands of extragalactic point sources (EPS), presented in the Planck ERCSC.\nWe review the results on the SZ effect in galaxy clusters. We discuss the\npossibilities of future Planck data to study clusters through the SZ effect and\nthe interesting possibilities of combining these data with X ray observations.\nThese EPS can be classified into two main source classes: radio sources, at\nintermediate to high z; far IR sources, typically at very z. Planck number\ncounts of EPS at LFI frequencies are in agreement with WMAP counts. A clear\nsteepening of the mean spectral index of bright radio sources is observed above\n70 GHz, that can be interpreted in terms of a break frequency in their spectra.\nFor nearby dusty galaxies, Planck observations find evidence of colder dust,\nwith T < 20 K, than has previously been found. More recently, the number counts\nof bright local dusty galaxies and of synchrotron sources have been measured by\nPlanck at submm wavelengths. Planck has provided interesting results on the\nangular distribution of CIB anisotropies, allowing us to put new constraints on\nclustering properties of dusty galaxies at high z.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Feb 2013 10:11:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-15"}

This\npaper focuses on the efficient characterisation of dynamical properties of\nDiscrete Reaction Networks (DRNs). DRNs can be seen as modelling the underlying\ndiscrete nondeterministic transitions of stochastic models of reactions\nnetworks. In that sense, any proof of non-reachability in DRNs directly applies\nto any concrete stochastic models, independently of kinetics laws and\nconstants. Moreover, if stochastic kinetic rates never vanish, reachability\nproperties are equivalent in the two settings. The analysis of two global\ndynamical properties of DRNs is addressed: irreducibility, i.e., the ability to\nreach any discrete state from any other state; and recurrence, i.e., the\nability to return to any initial state. Our results consider both the\nverification of such properties when species are present in a large copy\nnumber, and in the general case. The obtained necessary and sufficient\nconditions involve algebraic conditions on the network reactions which in most\ncases can be verified using linear programming. Finally, the relationship of\nDRN irreducibility and recurrence with dynamical properties of stochastic and\ncontinuous models of reaction networks is discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Feb 2013 10:46:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-15"}

Comparison of heat treatments carried out just below the melting\npoint and with the usual melt process makes it clear that melting is crucial to\ndeveloping high internal pressure. The decay of Jc away from the ends is\ndirectly correlated to the local wire diameter increase, which decreases the\nlocal Bi-2212 filament mass density and lowers Jc, often by well over 50%.

Since all the\ntime-steps are positive, the technique is particularly suited to stiff\nproblems, where a negative time-step can cause instabilities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Feb 2013 12:38:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-15"}

The\nMASIV (The Micro-Arcsecond Scintillation-Induced Variability) survey of 443\nflat spectrum sources revealed that the IDV is related to the radio flux\ndensity and redshift. A study of the physical properties of these sources has\nbeen severely handicapped by the absence of reliable redshift measurements for\nmany of these objects. This paper presents 79 new redshifts and a critical\nevaluation of 233 redshifts obtained from the literature. We classify\nspectroscopic identifications based on emission line properties, finding that\n78% of the sources have broad emission lines and are mainly FSRQs. About 16%\nare weak lined objects, chiefly BL Lacs, and the remaining 6% are narrow line\nobjects. The gross properties (redshift, spectroscopic class) of the MASIV\nsample are similar to those of other blazar surveys. However, the extreme\ncompactness implied by ISS favors FSRQs and BL Lacs in the MASIV sample as\nthese are the most compact object classes. We confirm that the level of IDV\ndepends on the 5\\,GHz flux density for all optical spectral types. We find that\nBL Lac objects tend to be more variable than broad line quasars. The level of\nISS decreases substantially above a redshift of about two. The decrease is\nfound to be generally consistent with ISS expected for beamed emission from a\njet that is limited to a fixed maximum brightness temperature in the source\nrest frame.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Feb 2013 14:22:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

The measured ratio central to peripheral events\nshows a suppresion by a factor of 5 at pT=7GeV.

The derived gamma_b (the\nbreak Lorenz factor of the electron distribution) are 10^4-10^6 for Mrk 501 and\n200~600 for 3C 279 and the magnetic field strength (B) of Mrk 501 is usually\none order of magnitude lower than that of 3C 279, but their Doppler factors\n(delta) are comparable. A spectral variation feature that the peak luminosity\nis correlated with the peak frequency, which is opposite to the blazar\nsequence, is observed in the two sources. We find that (1) the peak\nluminosities of the two bumps in SEDs for Mrk 501 depend on gamma_b in both the\nobserver and co-moving frames, but they are not correlated with B and delta;\n(2)the luminosity variation of 3C 279 is dominated by the external Compton (EC)\npeak and its peak luminosity is correlated with gamma_b and delta, but\nanti-correlated with B. These results suggest that gamma_b may govern the\nspectral variation of Mrk 501 and delta and B would be responsible for the\nspectral variation of 3C 279. The narrow distribution of gamma_b and the\ncorrelation of gamma_b and B in 3C 279 would be due to the cooling by the EC\nprocess and the strong magnetic field. Based on our brief discussion, we\npropose that this spectral variation feature may be originated from the\ninstability of the corona but not from the variation of the accretion rate as\nthat for the blazar sequence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Feb 2013 08:12:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

Each approximant is expressed by a Fourier sum whose coefficients are\ngiven by suitable linear combinations of Bessel functions, which are expected\nto be more accessible, especially at an undergraduate level, with respect to\nJacobian elliptic functions. The first three approximants are explicitely\nobtained and compared with the exact solution for typical initial angular\npositions of the pendulum. In particular, it is shown that, at the lowest\napproximation level, the law of motion of the pendulum turns out to be\nadequately described, up to oscillation amplitudes of $\\pi/2$, by a sinusoidal\ntemporal behaviour with a frequency proportional to the square root of the\nso-called \"besinc\" function, well known in physical optics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Feb 2013 14:11:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-21"}
