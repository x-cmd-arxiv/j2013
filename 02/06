In this picture the\ngravity sector is described by an $SO(1,4)$ or $SO(2,3)$ gauge field\n$A^{a}_{\\phantom{a}b\\mu}$ and Higgs field $V^{a}$ which acts to break the\nsymmetry down to that of the Lorentz group $SO(1,3)$. This symmetry breaking\nmirrors that of electroweak theory. However, a notable difference is that while\nthe Higgs field $\\Phi$ of electroweak theory is taken as a genuine dynamical\nfield satisfying a Klein-Gordon equation, the gauge independent norm $V^2\\equiv\n\\eta_{ab}V^{a}V^{b}$ of the Higgs-type field $V^a$ is typically regarded as\nnon-dynamical. Instead, in many treatments $V^a$ does not appear explicitly in\nthe formalism or is required to satisfy $V^2 = \\mathrm{const.} \\neq 0$ by means\nof a Lagrangian constraint. As an alternative to this we propose a class of\npolynomial actions that treat both the gauge connection\n$A^{a}_{\\phantom{a}b\\mu}$ and Higgs field $V^a$ as genuine dynamical fields\nwith no ad-hoc constraints imposed. The resultant equations of motion consist\nof a set of first-order partial differential equations.

The proof using $_V$K-equivalence is considerably shorter - by a\nwide margin - than one using A-equivalence directly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Feb 2013 16:40:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-06"}

The challenge in achieving reversibility\nfor an n-particle collision (where, n << N) arises from the presence of nd-d-1\ndegrees of freedom during each collision, and from the complex geometrical\nconstraints placed on the colliding particles. To reverse the collisions in a\ntraditional simulation setting, all of the particular realizations of these\ndegrees of freedom during the forward simulation must be saved. This limitation\nis addressed here by first performing a pseudo-randomization of angles,\nensuring determinism in the reverse path for any values of n and d. To address\nthe more difficult problem of geometrical and dynamic constraints, a new\napproach is developed which correctly samples the constrained phase space. Upon\ncombining the pseudo-randomization with correct phase space sampling, perfect\nreversibility of collisions is achieved, as illustrated for n <= 3, d=2, and\nn=2, d=3 (and, in principle, generalizable to larger n). This result enables\nfor the first time reversible simulations of elastic collisions with\nessentially zero memory accumulation.

Spatial scanning with Hubble/WFC3 provides an opportunity to\nresolve this ambiguity. We here report WFC3 spectroscopy of the giant planets\nHD209458b and XO-1b in transit, using spatial scanning mode for maximum\nphoton-collecting efficiency. We introduce an analysis technique that derives\nthe exoplanetary transmission spectrum without the necessity of explicitly\ndecorrelating instrumental effects, and achieves nearly photon-limited\nprecision even at the high flux levels collected in spatial scan mode. Our\nerrors are within 6-percent (XO-1) and 26-percent (HD209458b) of the\nphoton-limit at a spectral resolving power of 70, and are better than\n0.01-percent per spectral channel. Both planets exhibit water absorption of\napproximately 200 ppm at the water peak near 1.38 microns. Our result for XO-1b\ncontradicts the much larger absorption derived from NICMOS spectroscopy. The\nweak water absorption we measure for HD209458b is reminiscent of the weakness\nof sodium absorption in the first transmission spectroscopy of an exoplanet\natmosphere by Charbonneau et al. (2002). Model atmospheres having\nuniformly-distributed extra opacity of 0.012 cm^2 per gram account\napproximately for both our water measurement and the sodium absorption in this\nplanet. Our results for HD209458b support the picture advocated by Pont et al.\n(2013) in which weak molecular absorptions are superposed on a transmission\nspectrum that is dominated by continuous opacity due to haze and/or dust.\nHowever, the extra opacity needed for HD209458b is grayer than for HD189733b,\nwith a weaker Rayleigh component.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Feb 2013 18:11:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 Jul 2013 16:03:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

Unlike most candidate explanations,\nthis paper proposes that increasing evolvability can result without any\npressure to adapt. The insight is that if evolvability is heritable, then an\nunbiased drifting process across genotypes can still create a distribution of\nphenotypes biased towards evolvability, because evolvable organisms diffuse\nmore quickly through the space of possible phenotypes. Furthermore, because\nphenotypic divergence often correlates with founding niches, niche founders may\non average be more evolvable, which through population growth provides a\ngenotypic bias towards evolvability. Interestingly, the combination of these\ntwo mechanisms can lead to increasing evolvability without any pressure to\nout-compete other organisms, as demonstrated through experiments with a series\nof simulated models. Thus rather than from pressure to adapt, evolvability may\ninevitably result from any drift through genotypic space combined with\nevolution's passive tendency to accumulate niches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Feb 2013 18:14:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

These\npredictions have guided the interpretation of resonances seen experimentally.\nOn the other hand, self-consistent calculations consistently predict very\nshallow potential-energy surfaces in the third minimum region. Purpose: We\ninvestigate the interpretation of third-minimum configurations in terms of\ndimolecular states. We study the isentropic potential-energy surfaces of\nselected even-even thorium and uranium isotopes at several excitation energies.\nIn order to understand the driving effects behind the presence of third minima,\nwe study the interplay between pairing and shell effects. Methods: We use the\nfinite-temperature superfluid nuclear density functional theory. We consider a\ntraditional functional, SkM*, and a recent functional, UNEDF1, optimized for\nfission studies. Results: We predict very shallow or no third minima in the\npotential-energy surfaces of 232Th and 232U. In Th and U isotopes with N=136\nand 138, the third minima are deeper. We show that the reflection-asymmetric\nconfigurations around the third minimum can be associated with dimolecular\nstates involving the spherical doubly magic 132Sn and a lighter deformed Zr or\nMo fragment.

Conclusions: We show that the neutron shell\neffect that governs the existence of the dimolecular states around the third\nminimum is consistent with the spherical-to-deformed shape transition in the Zr\nand Mo isotopes around N=58. We demonstrate that the thermal reduction of\npairing and enhancement of shell effects at small excitation energies help to\ndevelop deeper third minima.

Our\napproach consists of three elements: (i) ab initio calculations of DNA, (ii)\nGreen's function approach for transport calculations, and (iii) the use of two\nparameters to determine the decoherence rates. We first study the role of the\nbackbone. We find that the backbone can alter the coherent transmission\nsignificantly at some energy points by interacting with the bases, though the\noverall shape of the transmission stays similar for the two cases. More\nimportantly, we find that the coherent electrical conductance is tremendously\nsmaller than what the experiments measure. We consider DNA strands under a\nvariety of different experimental conditions and show that even in the most\nideal cases, the calculated coherent conductance is much smaller than the\nexperimental conductance. To understand the reasons for this, we carefully look\nat the effect of decoherence. By including decoherence, we show that our model\ncan rationalize the measured conductance of the four strands, both\nqualitatively and quantitatively. We find that the effect of decoherence on G:C\nbase pairs is crucial in getting agreement with the experiments. However, the\ndecoherence on G:C base pairs alone does not explain the experimental\nconductance in strands containing a number of A:T base pairs. Including\ndecoherence on A:T base pairs is also essential. By fitting the experimental\ntrends and magnitudes in the conductance of the four different DNA molecules,\nwe estimate for the first time that the deocherence rate is 6 meV for G:C and\n1.5 meV for A:T base pairs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Feb 2013 20:26:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-06"}

Two types\nof approaches have been pursued: 3D tracking of homologous parts of the surface\nto compute a displacement field, and distance calculation between two point\nclouds when homologous parts cannot be defined. This study deals with the\nsecond approach, typical of natural surfaces altered by erosion, sedimentation\nor vegetation between surveys. Current comparison methods are based on a\nclosest point distance or require at least one of the PC to be meshed with\nsevere limitations when surfaces present roughness elements at all scales. We\nintroduce a new algorithm performing a direct comparison of point clouds in 3D.\nSurface normals are first estimated in 3D at a scale consistent with the local\nsurface roughness. The measurement of the mean change along the normal\ndirection is then performed with an explicit calculation of a confidence\ninterval. Comparison with existing methods demonstrates the higher accuracy of\nour approach, as well as an easier workflow due to the absence of surface\nmeshing or DEM generation. Application of the method in a rapidly eroding\nmeandering bedrock river (Rangitikei river canyon) illustrates its ability to\nhandle 3D differences in complex situations (flat and vertical surfaces on the\nsame scene), to reduce uncertainty related to point cloud roughness by local\naveraging and to generate 3D maps of uncertainty levels. Combined with mm-range\nlocal georeferencing of the point clouds, levels of detection down to 6 mm can\nbe routinely attained in situ over ranges of 50 m. We provide evidence for the\nself-affine behavior of different surfaces. We show how this impacts the\ncalculation of normal vectors and demonstrate the scaling behavior of the level\nof change detection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Feb 2013 20:37:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-06"}

One\npromising approach is to link galaxies at fixed number density, rather than\nfixed luminosity or mass. This method is effective if stellar mass rank order\nis broadly conserved through cosmic time. In this paper, we use the Guo et al.\n(2011) semi-analytical model to analyze under what circumstances this\nassumption is valid in the context of a cosmological simulation. Specifically,\nwe select progenitor galaxies at a constant number density and compare the\nstellar mass evolution of their descendants to the evolution at a constant\nnumber density. The median stellar mass of the descendants increases by a\nfactor of four (0.6 dex) from z = 3 to z = 0. Constant number density selection\nreproduces this to within 40% (0.15 dex) over a wide range of number densities.\nWe show that the discrepancy primarily results from scatter in the stellar mass\ngrowth rates and merging. After applying simple, observationally-based\ncorrections for these processes, the discrepancy is reduced to 12% (0.05 dex).\nWe conclude that number density selection can be used to predict the median\ndescendant mass of high-redshift progenitor galaxies. The main uncertainty in\nthis study is that semi-analytical models do not reproduce the observed mass\nevolution of galaxies, which makes the quantitative aggregate effects of star\nformation, merging, and quenching on the rank order of galaxies somewhat\nuncertain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Feb 2013 21:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

The UV-to-optical colors of AGNs are\nconsistent with equally massive inactive galaxies at redshifts out to z~2, but\nwe show that such colors are poor tracers of star formation. While the FIR\ndistributions of both star-forming AGNs and star-forming inactive galaxies are\nstatistically similar, we show that AGNs are preferentially found in\nstar-forming host galaxies, or, in other words, AGNs are less likely to be\nfound in weakly star-forming or quenched galaxies. We postulate that, among\nX-ray selected AGNs of low and moderate accretion luminosities, the supply of\ncold gas primarily determines the accretion rate distribution of the nuclear\nblack holes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Feb 2013 21:00:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 May 2013 12:38:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

A total of 55 new protostar\ncandidates are detected at 70 um and 160 um that are either too faint (m24 > 7\nmag) to be reliably classified as protostars or undetected in the Spitzer/MIPS\n24 um band. We find that the 11 reddest protostar candidates with log (lambda\nF_lambda 70) / (lambda F_lambda 24) > 1.65 are free of contamination and can\nthus be reliably explained as protostars. The remaining 44 sources have less\nextreme 70/24 colors, fainter 70 um fluxes, and higher levels of contamination.\nTaking the previously known sample of Spitzer protostars and the new sample\ntogether, we find 18 sources that have log (lambda F_lambda 70) / (lambda\nF_lambda 24) > 1.65; we name these sources \"PACS Bright Red sources\", or PBRs.\nOur analysis reveals that the PBRs sample is composed of Class 0 like sources\ncharacterized by very red SEDs (T_bol < 45 K) and large values of\nsub-millimeter fluxes (L_smm/L_bol > 0.6%). Modified black-body fits to the\nSEDs provide lower limits to the envelope masses of 0.2 M_sun to 2 M_sun and\nluminosities of 0.7 L_sun to 10 L_sun. Based on these properties, and a\ncomparison of the SEDs with radiative transfer models of protostars, we\nconclude that the PBRs are most likely extreme Class 0 objects distinguished by\nhigher than typical envelope densities and hence, high mass infall rates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Feb 2013 21:00:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

For masses $< 2\nM_{\\odot}$ we find dimensionless r-mode amplitudes in the range from about\n$1\\times 10^{-8}$ to $1.5\\times 10^{-6}$. For the accreting millisecond X-ray\npulsar sources with known quiescent spin-down rates these limits suggest that\n$\\lesssim 1%$ of the observed rate can be due to an unstable r-mode.\nInterestingly, the source with the highest amplitude limit, NGC 6440, could\nhave an r-mode spin-down rate comparable to the observed, quiescent rate for\nSAX J1808-3658. Thus, quiescent spin-down measurements for this source would be\nparticularly interesting. For all sources considered here our amplitude limits\nsuggest that gravitational wave signals are likely too weak for detection with\nAdvanced LIGO. Our highest mass model ($2.21\\, M_{\\odot}$) can support\nenhanced, direct Urca neutrino emission in the core and thus can have higher\nr-mode amplitudes. Indeed, the inferred r-mode spin-down rates at these higher\namplitudes are inconsistent with the observed spin-down rates for some of the\nsources, such as IGR J00291+5934 and XTE J1751-305.

Depending\non the distance of the source, the Universe should be opaque to VHE photons\nabove a certain energy. However, indications exist that the Universe is more\ntransparent than previously thought. A recent statistical analysis of a large\nsample of VHE spectra shows that the correction for absorption with current EBL\nmodels is too strong for the data points with the highest attenuation. An\nexplanation might be the oscillation of VHE photons into hypothetical\naxion-like particles (ALPs) in ambient magnetic fields. This mechanism would\ndecrease the opacity as ALPs propagate unimpeded over cosmological distances.\n  Here, a large sample of VHE gamma-ray spectra obtained with imaging air\nCherenkov telescopes is used to set, for the first time, lower limits on the\nphoton-ALP coupling constant over a large range of ALP masses. The conversion\nin different magnetic field configurations, including intra-cluster and\nintergalactic magnetic fields together with the magnetic field of the Milky\nWay, is investigated taking into account the energy dependence of the\noscillations. For optimistic scenarios of the intervening magnetic fields, a\nlower limit on the photon-ALP coupling of the order of\n$10^{-12}\\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$ is obtained whereas more conservative model\nassumptions result in $2\\times10^{-11}\\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$.

However, the extraction of photoelectrons in conventional\nmetal-graphene junction devices is limited by their small junction area, where\nthe typical photoresponsivity is lower than 0.01 AW-1. On the other hand, the\natomically thin layer of molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is a two-dimensional (2d)\nnanomaterial with a direct and finite band gap, offering the possibility of\nacting as a 2d light absorber. The optoelectronic properties of the\nheterostructure of these two films is therefore of great interest. The growth\nof large-area graphene using chemical vapour deposition (CVD) has become mature\nnowadays. However, the growth of large-area MoS2 monolayer is still\nchallenging. In this work, we show that a large-area and continuous MoS2\nmonolayer is achievable using a CVD method. Both graphene and MoS2 layers are\ntransferable onto desired substrates, making possible immediate and large-scale\noptoelectronic applications. We demonstrate that a phototransistor based on the\ngraphene/MoS2 heterostructure is able to provide a high photoresponsivity\ngreater than 107 A/W while maintaining its ultrathin and planar structure. Our\nexperiments show that the electron-hole pairs are produced in the MoS2 layer\nafter light absorption and subsequently separated across the layers.\nContradictory to the expectation based on the conventional built-in electric\nfield model for metal-semiconductor contacts, photoelectrons are injected into\nthe graphene layer rather than trapped in MoS2 due to the alignment of the\ngraphene Fermi level with the conduction band of MoS2.

This choice is often justified by invoking the Eckart-Young theorem\neven though that work addresses the problem of how to best represent a\nsignal-plus-noise matrix using a low-rank approximation and not how to\nbest_infer_ the underlying low-rank signal component.\n  Here we take a first-principles approach in which we start with a\nsignal-plus-noise data matrix and show how the spectrum of the noise-only\ncomponent governs whether the principal or the middle components of the\nsingular value decomposition of the data matrix will be the informative\ncomponents for inference. Simply put, if the noise spectrum is supported on a\nconnected interval, in a sense we make precise, then the use of the principal\ncomponents is justified. When the noise spectrum is supported on multiple\nintervals, then the middle components might be more informative than the\nprincipal components.\n  The end result is a proper justification of the use of principal components\nin the setting where the noise matrix is i.i.d. Gaussian and the identification\nof scenarios, generically involving heterogeneous noise models such as mixtures\nof Gaussians, where the middle components might be more informative than the\nprincipal components so that they may be exploited to extract additional\nprocessing gain. Our results show how the blind use of principal components can\nlead to suboptimal or even faulty inference because of phase transitions that\nseparate a regime where the principal components are informative from a regime\nwhere they are uninformative.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Feb 2013 23:20:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-07"}

Other\nsources have also been proposed, among which, local adsorption of water vapor\nonto dust grains in the primordial nebula and delivery through planetesimals\nand planetary embryos have become more prominent. However, no sole source of\nwater provides a satisfactory explanation for Earth's water as a whole. In view\nof that, using numerical simulations, we have developed a compound model\nincorporating both the principal endogenous and exogenous theories, and\ninvestigating their implications for terrestrial planet formation and\nwater-delivery. Comets are also considered in the final analysis, as it is\nlikely that at least some of Earth's water has cometary origin.

Immediate knowledge of such precise position allows the use of sensitive\ncoherent beams of array telescopes for follow-up timing observations, which\nsubstantially reduces the use of telescope time (~ 20X for the GMRT). In\naddition, precise a-priori astrometric position reduces the effect of large\ncovariances in timing fit (with discovery position, pulsar period derivative\nand unknown binary model), which in-turn accelerates the convergence to initial\ntiming model. For example, while fitting with precise a-priori position (+-1\"),\ntiming model converges in about 100 days, accounting the effect of covariance\nbetween position and pulsar period derivative. Moreover, such accurate\npositions allows for rapid identification of pulsar counterpart at other\nwave-bands.

By applying the unified model to representative\nmultiferroics where the electronic and ion-displacement contributions vary\nwidely, we find that this model can not only reproduce the first-principles\nresults, but also provide insight into the origin of ferroelectricity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Feb 2013 03:03:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-01"}

The model requires the following two key ingredients: (i) mass assembly\nhistories of central and satellite galaxies, and (ii) local observational\nconstraints of the star formation rates of central galaxies as function of halo\nmass. We obtain a universal fitting formula that describes the (median) SFH of\ncentral galaxies as function of halo mass, galaxy stellar mass and redshift. We\nuse this model to make predictions for various aspects of the star formation\nrates of central galaxies across cosmic time. Our main findings are the\nfollowing. (1) The specific star formation rate (SSFR) at high $z$ increases\nrapidly with increasing redshift [$\\propto (1+z)^{2.5}$] for halos of a given\nmass and only slowly with halo mass ($\\propto M_h^{0.12}$) at a given $z$, in\nalmost perfect agreement with the specific mass accretion rate of dark matter\nhalos.

The highest levels of galactic protons\nwere recorded at Earth in late 2009 in contrast to expectations.

The\nmodel is used to determine what mechanisms were mainly responsible for the\nmodulation of protons during this period, and why the observed spectrum for\n2009 was the highest ever recorded. From mid-2006 until December 2009 we find\nthat the spectra became significantly softer because increasingly more low\nenergy protons had reached Earth. To simulate this effect, the rigidity\ndependence of the diffusion coefficients had to decrease significantly below ~3\nGeV. The modulation minimum period of 2009 can thus be described as relatively\nmore \"diffusion dominated\" than previous solar minima. However, we illustrate\nthat drifts still had played a significant role but that the observable\nmodulation effects were not as well correlated with the waviness of the\nheliospheric current sheet as before. Protons still experienced global gradient\nand curvature drifts as the heliospheric magnetic field had decreased\nsignificantly until the end of 2009, in contrast to the moderate decreases\nobserved during previous minimum periods.

The laws for\nvariation and inheritance of the parameters are also subject to CNS if\nvariation in transmission laws occurs. This is the strategy introduced by Nei\n(1967) to understand genetic transmission, through the evolutionary theory of\nmodifier genes, whose methodology is adopted here. When mechanisms of variation\nthemselves vary, they are subject to Feldman's (1972) evolutionary Reduction\nPrinciple that selection favors greater faithfulness of replication. A theorem\nof Karlin (1982) allows one to generalize this principle beyond biological\ngenetics to the unknown inheritance laws that would operate in CNS. The\nreduction principle for CNS is illustrated with a general multitype branching\nprocess model of universe creation containing competing inheritance laws. The\nmost faithful inheritance law dominates the ensemble of universes. The\nReduction Principle thus provides a mechanism to account for high fidelity of\ninheritance between universes. Moreover, it reveals that natural selection in\nthe presence of variation in inheritance mechanisms has two distinct objects:\nmaximization of both fitness and faithful inheritance. Tradeoffs between\nfitness and faithfulness open the possibility that evolved fundamental\nparameters are compromises, and not local optima to maximize universe\nproduction, in which case their local non-optimality may point to their\ninvolvement in the universe inheritance mechanisms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Feb 2013 09:18:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Feb 2013 09:18:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-21"}

We are led to two main results: i) We\nconstruct in our concrete example a convenient set of variables, proposed first\nby Benettin and Gallavotti (1986), in which the phenomenon of Arnold diffusion\nin doubly resonant domains can be clearly visualized. ii) We determine, by\nnumerical fitting of our data the dependence of the local diffusion coefficient\n\"D\" on the size \"||R_{opt}||\" of the optimal remainder function, and we compare\nthis with a heuristic argument based on the assumption of normal diffusion. We\nfind a power law \"D\\propto ||R_{opt}||^{2(1+b)}\", where the constant \"b\" has a\nsmall positive value depending also on the multiplicity of the resonance\nconsidered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Feb 2013 10:15:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

It could then be an effective method to identify\nquark/quark-cluster stars by soft X-ray polarimetry. We are therefore expecting\nto detect thermal X-ray polarization in the coming decades.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Feb 2013 11:48:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-30"}

These gradients are taken to be due to the\nsystematic variation of the line of sight-B-field across the jet. We present\nhere the parsec-scale Faraday Rotation distributions for the BL Lac objects\n0716+714 and 1749+701, based on polarization data obtained with the Very Long\nBaseline Array (VLBA) at two wavelengths near each of the 2cm, 4cm and 6cm\nbands (0716+714) and at four wavelengths in the range 18-22 cm (1749+701). The\nRotation Measure (RM) maps for both these sources indicate systematic gradients\nacross their jets, as expected if these jets have helical B fields. The\nsignificance of these transverse RM gradients is > 3 sigma in all cases. We\npresent the results of Monte Carlo simulations directly demonstrating the\npossibility of observing such transverse RM gradients even if the intrinsic jet\nstructure is much narrower than the observing beam. We observe an intriguing\nnew feature in these sources, a reversal in the direction of the gradient in\nthe jet as compared to the gradient in the core region. This provides new\nevidence to support models in which field lines emerging from the central\nregion of the accretion disk and closing in the outer region of the accretion\ndisk are both \"wound up\" by the differential rotation of the disk. The net\nobserved RM gradient will essentially be the sum effect of two regions of\nhelical field, one nested inside the other. The direction of the net RM\ngradient will be determined by whether the inner or outer helix dominates the\nRM integrated through the jet, and RM gradient reversals will be observed if\nthe inner and outer helical fields dominate in different regions of the jet.\nThis potentially provides new insights about the overall configuration of the\njet B fields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Feb 2013 12:51:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-19"}

First, during the slowly fading\nplateau phase (2005 March) and second, just before the rapid fading of the\nobject (2005 September), which ended the outburst. We used the radiative\ntransfer code MC3D to fit the interferometry data and the spectral energy\ndistributions from five different epochs at different stages of the outburst.\nThe comparison of these models allowed us to trace structural changes in the\nsystem on AU-scales. We also considered qualitative alternatives for the\ninterpretation of our data. Results: We found that the disk and the envelope\nare similar to those of non-eruptive young stars and that the accretion rate\nvaried during the outburst. We also found evidence for the increase of the\ninner radii of the circumstellar disk and envelope at the beginning of the\noutburst. Furthermore, the change of the interferometric visibilities indicates\nstructural changes in the circumstellar material. We test a few scenarios to\ninterpret these data. We also speculate that the changes are caused by the\nfading of the central source, which is not immediately followed by the fading\nof the outer regions. However, if the delay in the fading of the disk is\nresponsible for the changes seen in the MIDI data, the effect should be\nconfirmed by dynamical modeling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Feb 2013 12:55:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

In this paper, we discuss the possibility of\ndetermining the octant of theta_{23} in the long baseline experiments T2K and\nNOvA in conjunction with future atmospheric neutrino detectors, in light of\nnon-zero value of theta_{13} measured by reactor experiments. We consider two\ndetector technologies for atmospheric neutrinos - magnetized iron calorimeter\nand non-magnetized Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber. We present the octant\nsensitivity for T2K/NOvA and atmospheric neutrino experiments separately as\nwell as combined. For the long baseline experiments, a precise measurement of\ntheta_{13}, which can exclude degenerate solutions in the wrong octant,\nincreases the sensitivity drastically. For theta_{23} = 39^o and sin^2 2\ntheta_{13} = 0.1, at least ~2 sigma sensitivity can be achieved by T2K+NOvA for\nall values of delta_{CP} for both normal and inverted hierarchy. For\natmospheric neutrinos, the moderately large value of theta_{13} measured in the\nreactor experiments is conducive to octant sensitivity because of enhanced\nmatter effects. A magnetized iron detector can give a 2 sigma octant\nsensitivity for 500 kT yr exposure for theta_{23} = 39^o, delta_{CP} = 0 and\nnormal hierarchy. This increases to 3 sigma for both hierarchies by combining\nwith T2K+NOvA. This is due to a preference of different theta_{23} values at\nthe minimum chi^2 by T2K/NOvA and atmospheric neutrino experiments. A Liquid\nArgon detector for atmospheric neutrinos with the same exposure can give higher\noctant sensitivity, due to the interplay of muon and electron contributions and\nsuperior resolutions. We obtain a ~3 sigma sensitivity for theta_{23} = 39^o\nfor normal hierarchy. This increases to > ~4 sigma for all values of delta_{CP}\nif combined with T2K+NOvA.

This relation was derived from\na sample of spiral galaxies taken from the Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA)\nsurvey and detected in the FIR/submm in the Herschel-ATLAS survey. Using a\nquantitative analysis of the NUV attenuation-inclination relation for complete\nsamples of GAMA spirals categorized according to \\mu_{*} we demonstrate that\nthis correlation can be used to statistically correct for dust attenuation\npurely on the basis of optical photometry and S'ersic-profile morphological\nfits. Considered together with previously established empirical relationships\nbetween stellar mass, metallicity and gas mass, the near linearity and high\nconstant of proportionality of the \\tau^f_B-\\mu_{*} relation disfavors a\nstellar origin for the bulk of refractory grains in spiral galaxies, instead\nbeing consistent with the existence of a ubiquitous and very rapid mechanism\nfor the growth of dust in the ISM.

Its observation is then a potentially valuable\ndiagnostic of dust attenuation, particularly at high-redshift where other\ndiagnostics are currently inaccesible. Interpreting the observed UV continuum\nslope in the context of dust attenuation is often achieved assuming the\nempirically calibrated Meurer et al. (1999) relation. Implicit in this relation\nis the assumption of an intrinsic UV continuum slope ($\\beta=-2.23$). However,\nresults from numerical simulations suggest that the intrinsic UV continuum\nslopes of high-redshift star forming galaxies are bluer than this, and moreover\nvary with redshift.

Since all TD protoplanets are\ninitially as massive as $\\sim 10$ Jupiter masses, they are able to open very\ndeep gaps in their discs, and even completely isolate the inner disc flows from\nthe outer ones. Furthermore, in contrast to other planet formation theories, TD\nprotoplanets are mass donors for their protostars. One potentially observable\nsignature of planets being devoured by their protostars are FU Ori like\noutbursts, and episodic protostar accretion more generally, as discussed by a\nnumber of authors recently.\n  Here we explore another observational implication of TD hypothesis: dust poor\ninner accretion flows, which we believe may be relevant to some of the observed\nmm-bright transitional discs around protostars. In our model, a massive\nprotoplanet interrupts the flow of the outer dust-rich disc on its protostar,\nand at the same time looses a part of its dust-poor envelope into the inner\ndisc. This then powers the observed gas-but-no-dust accretion onto the star.\nUpon a more detailed investigation, we find that this scenario is quite natural\nfor young massive discs but is less so for older discs, e.g., those whose\nself-gravitating phase has terminated a fraction of a Million year or more ago.\nThis stems from the fact that TD protoplanets of such an age should have\ncontracted significantly, and so are unlikely to loose much mass. Therefore, we\nconclude that either (i) the population of \"transition discs\" with large holes\nand dust-poor accretion is much younger than generally believed; or (ii) there\nis a poorly understood stage for late removal of dust-poor envelopes from TD\nplanets; (iii) another explanation for the observations is correct.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Feb 2013 15:00:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

Therefore,\na novel finite horizon adaptive optimal distributed power allocation scheme is\nproposed by incorporating the effect of channel uncertainties for enhanced\ncognitive radio network in the presence of wireless channel uncertainties under\ntwo cases. In Case 1, proposed scheme can force the Signal-to-interference\n(SIR) of the secondary users to converge to a higher target value for\nincreasing network throughput when primary users' are not communicating within\nfinite horizon. Once primary users are activated as in the Case 2, proposed\nscheme can not only force the SIR of primary users to converge to a higher\ntarget SIR, but also force the SIR of secondary users to converge to a lower\nvalue for regulating their interference to Pus during finite time period. In\norder to mitigate the attenuation of SIR due to channel uncertainties the\nproposed novel finite horizon adaptive optimal distributed power allocation\nallows the SIR of both primary users' and secondary users' to converge to a\ndesired target SIR while minimizing the energy consumption within finite\nhorizon. Simulation results illustrate that this novel finite horizon adaptive\noptimal distributed power allocation scheme can converge much faster and cost\nless energy than others by adapting to the channel variations optimally.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Feb 2013 15:04:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-07"}

Besides the structural knowledge, as specified by a\ngiven model, the statistical modelling may also include expert opinion about\nthe values of parameters in the model. It is shown how to translate imprecise\nexpert knowledge into approximately conjugate prior distributions. Based on\npossibly incomplete data, the score and the observed information are derived\nfor these models. This accounts for both the traditional score and observed\ninformation, derived as derivatives of the log-likelihood, and the posterior\nscore and observed information, derived as derivatives of the log-posterior\ndistribution.

In this paper,\nwe present a decomposition method for parallelization of multi-dimensional FFTs\nwith smallest communication amount for all ranges of the number of processes\ncompared to previously proposed methods. This is achieved by two distinguishing\nfeatures: adaptive decomposition and transpose order awareness. In the proposed\nmethod, the FFT data are decomposed based on a row-wise basis that maps the\nmulti-dimensional data into one-dimensional data, and translates the\ncorresponding coordinates from multi-dimensions into one-dimension so that the\nresultant one-dimensional data can be divided and allocated equally to the\nprocesses. As a result, differently from previous works that have the\ndimensions of decomposition pre-defined, our method can adaptively decompose\nthe FFT data on the lowest possible dimensions depending on the number of\nprocesses. In addition, this row-wise decomposition provides plenty of\nalternatives in data transpose, and different transpose order results in\ndifferent amount of communication. We identify the best transpose orders with\nsmallest communication amounts for the 3-D, 4-D, and 5-D FFTs by analyzing all\npossible cases. Given both communication efficiency and scalability, our method\nis promising in development of highly efficient parallel packages for the FFT.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Feb 2013 04:43:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-26"}
