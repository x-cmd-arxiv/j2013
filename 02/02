In this work we propose a problem that considers the use of\nrate adaptation as the energy saving strategy in networks. The problem is\nmodeled as an integral demand-routing problem in a network with discrete cost\nfunctions at the links. The discreteness of the cost function comes from the\ndifferent states (bandwidths) at which links can operate and, in particular,\nfrom the energy consumed at each state. This in its turn leads to the\nnon-convexity of the cost function, and thus adds complexity to solve this\nproblem. We formulate this routing problem as an integer program, and we show\nthat the general case of this problem is NP-hard, and even hard to approximate.\nFor the special case when the step ratio of the cost function is bounded, we\nshow that effective approximations can be obtained. Our main algorithm executes\ntwo processes in sequence: relaxation and rounding. The relaxation process\neliminates the non-convexity of the cost function, so that the problem is\ntransformed into a fractional convex program solvable in polynomial time. After\nthat, a randomized rounding process is used to get a feasible solution for the\noriginal problem.

Photospheric emission is indeed expected when the\nrelativistic outflow emerging from the central engine becomes transparent to\nits own radiation, with a quasi-blackbody spectrum in absence of additional\nsub-photospheric dissipation. However, its intensity strongly depends on the\nacceleration mechanism - thermal or magnetic - of the flow. We aim to compute\nthe thermal and non-thermal emissions produced by an outflow with a variable\nLorentz factor, where the power injected at the origin is partially thermal\n(fraction epsilon_th) and partially magnetic (fraction 1-epsilon_th). The\nthermal emission is produced at the photosphere, and the non-thermal emission\nin the optically thin regime. Apart from the value of epsilon_th, we want to\ntest how the other model parameters affect the observed ratio of the thermal to\nnon-thermal emission. If the non-thermal emission is made by internal shocks,\nwe self-consistently obtained the light curves and spectra of the thermal and\nnon-thermal components for any distribution of the Lorentz factor in the flow.\nIf the non-thermal emission results from magnetic reconnection we were unable\nto produce a light curve and could only compare the respective non-thermal and\nthermal spectra. In the different considered cases, we varied the model\nparameters to see when the thermal component in the light curve and/or spectrum\nis likely to show up or, on the contrary, to be hidden. We finally compared our\nresults to the proposed evidence for the presence of a thermal component in GRB\nspectra. Focussing on GRB 090902B and GRB 10072B, we showed how these\nobservations can be used to constrain the nature and acceleration mechanism of\nGRB outflows.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Feb 2013 18:05:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

Here we consider Markovian susceptible-infectious-susceptible (SIS)\ndynamics on finite strongly connected networks, applicable to several sexually\ntransmitted diseases and computer viruses. In this context, a theoretical\ndefinition of endemic prevalence is easily obtained via the quasi-stationary\ndistribution (QSD). By representing the model as a percolation process and\nutilising the property of duality, we also provide a theoretical definition of\ninvasion probability. We then show that, for undirected networks, the\nprobability of invasion from any given individual is equal to the\n(probabilistic) endemic prevalence, following successful invasion, at the\nindividual (we also provide a relationship for the directed case). The total\n(fractional) endemic prevalence in the population is thus equal to the average\ninvasion probability (across all individuals). Consequently, for such systems,\nthe regions or individuals already supporting a high level of infection are\nlikely to be the source of a successful invasion by another infectious agent.\nThis could be used to inform targeted interventions when there is a threat from\nan emerging infectious disease.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Feb 2013 19:16:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 Aug 2013 15:35:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-02"}

The net advantage of the method over the existing\nGroup Lasso (GL)-type procedures consists in the form of the proportionality\nfactor used in the penalty term, which for GSRL is independent of the variance\nof the error terms.

On the other hand, we are not aware of any\nfunction or relation for which the smooth-rectangle bound is (asymptotically)\nsmaller than its public-coin randomized communication complexity. The optimal\ndirect product for Tribes is obtained by combining our smooth-rectangle bound\nfor tribes with the strong direct product result of Jain and Yao [JY12] in\nterms of smooth-rectangle bound.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Feb 2013 20:47:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Feb 2013 04:16:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 19 Feb 2013 10:48:09 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 24 Mar 2013 22:36:18 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sun, 6 Oct 2013 03:38:31 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Fri, 11 Jul 2014 05:39:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-14"}

For two months preceding the spacecraft's closest\napproach, the Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS) onboard regularly imaged the\natmosphere. We created time-lapse movies from this period in order to analyze\nthe dynamics of equatorial hot spots and their interactions with adjacent\nlatitudes. Hot spots are quasi-stable, rectangular dark areas on\nvisible-wavelength images, with defined eastern edges that sharply contrast\nwith surrounding clouds, but diffuse western edges serving as nebulous\nboundaries with adjacent equatorial plumes. Hot spots exhibit significant\nvariations in size and shape over timescales of days and weeks. Some of these\nchanges correspond with passing vortex systems from adjacent latitudes\ninteracting with hot spots. Strong anticyclonic gyres present to the south and\nsoutheast of the dark areas appear to circulate into hot spots. Impressive,\nbright white plumes occupy spaces in between hot spots. Compact cirrus-like\n'scooter' clouds flow rapidly through the plumes before disappearing within the\ndark areas. These clouds travel at 150-200 m/s, much faster than the 100 m/s\nhot spot and plume drift speed. This raises the possibility that the scooter\nclouds may be more illustrative of the actual jet stream speed at these\nlatitudes. Most previously published zonal wind profiles represent the drift\nspeed of the hot spots at their latitude from pattern matching of the entire\nlongitudinal image strip. If a downward branch of an equatorially-trapped\nRossby waves controls the overall appearance of hot spots, however, the\nwestward phase velocity of the wave leads to underestimates of the true jet\nstream speed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Feb 2013 20:47:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

Using new published\nnon-rotating and rotating stellar tracks, we study the integrated properties of\nsynthetic stellar populations and find that the UV to SFR calibration for the\nrotating stellar population is 30% smaller than for the non-rotating stellar\npopulation, and 40% smaller for the Halpha to SFR calibration. These reductions\ntranslate to smaller SFR estimates made from observed UV and Halpha\nluminosities. Using the UV and Halpha fluxes of a sample of ~300 local\ngalaxies, we derive a total (i.e., sky-coverage corrected) SFR within 11 Mpc of\n120-170 Msun/yr and 80-130 Msun/yr for the non-rotating and rotating\nestimators, respectively. Independently, the number of core-collapse supernovae\ndiscovered in the same volume requires a total SFR of 270^{+110}_{-80} Msun/yr,\nsuggesting a mild tension with the SFR estimates made with rotating\ncalibrations. More generally, when compared with the estimated SFR, the local\nsupernova discoveries strongly constrain any physical effects that might\nincrease the energy output of massive stars, including, but not limited to,\nstellar rotation. The cosmic SFR and cosmic supernova rate data on the other\nhand show the opposite trend, with the cosmic SFR almost double that inferred\nfrom cosmic supernovae, constraining a significant decrease in the energy\noutput of massive stars.

We find\nthat the mean density within the scale radius, r_{-2} (where the halo density\nprofile has isothermal slope), is directly proportional to the critical density\nof the Universe at the time when the main progenitor's virial mass equals the\nmass enclosed within r_{-2}. Scaled to these characteristic values of mass and\ndensity, the mean MAH, expressed in terms of the critical density of the\nUniverse, M(\\rho_{crit}(z)), resembles that of the enclosed density profile,\nM(<\\rho >), at z=0. Both follow closely the NFW profile, suggesting that the\nsimilarity of halo mass profiles originates from the mass-independence of halo\nMAHs. Support for this interpretation is provided by outlier halos whose\naccretion histories deviate from the NFW shape; their mass profiles show\ncorrelated deviations from NFW and are better approximated by Einasto profiles.\nFitting both M(<\\rho >) and M(\\rho_{crit}) with either NFW or Einasto profiles\nyield concentration and shape parameters that are correlated, confirming and\nextending earlier work linking the concentration of a halo with its accretion\nhistory. These correlations also confirm that halo structure is insensitive to\ninitial conditions: only halos whose accretion histories differ greatly from\nthe NFW shape show noticeable deviations from NFW in their mass profiles. As a\nresult, the NFW profile provides acceptable fits to hot dark matter halos,\nwhich do not form hierarchically, and for fluctuation power spectra other than\nCDM. Our findings, however, predict a subtle but systematic dependence of mass\nprofile shape on accretion history which, if confirmed, would provide strong\nsupport for the link between accretion history and halo structure we propose\nhere.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Feb 2013 21:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 Dec 2013 19:35:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-07"}

Several numerical\nmethods are used to estimate $v_2$, resulting in various combinations of \"flow\"\nand \"nonflow\" that reveal systematic biases in the $v_2$ estimates. QCD jets\ncontribute strongly to azimuth correlations and specifically to the\n$\\cos(2\\phi)$ component. Purpose: We question the extent of jet-related\n(\"nonflow\") bias in and hydrodynamic \"flow\" interpretations of $v_2$\nmeasurements. Method: We introduce two-dimensional (2D) model fits to angular\ncorrelation data that distinguish accurately between jet-related correlation\ncomponents and a {\\em nonjet azimuth quadrupole} that might represent \"elliptic\nflow\" if that were relevant. We compare measured jet-related and \"flow\"-related\ndata systematics and determine the jet-related contribution to $v_2$\nmeasurements. Results: Jet structure does introduce substantial bias to\nconventional $v_2$ measurements, making interpretation difficult. The nonjet\nquadrupole exhibits very simple systematics on centrality and collision\nenergy---the two variables factorize. Within a \\auau centrality interval where\njets show no indication of rescattering or medium effects the nonjet quadrupole\namplitude rises to 60% of its maximum value. Conclusions: Disagreements between\nnonjet quadrupole systematics and hydro theory expectations, the large\nquadrupole amplitudes observed in more-peripheral \\auau collisions and a\nsignificant nonzero value in \\nn $\\approx$ \\pp collisions strongly suggest that\nthe nonjet quadrupole does not arise from a hydrodynamic \"flow\" mechanism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Feb 2013 21:39:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Sep 2014 21:33:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-25"}

However, mobile network operators face a challenge when it comes to\nspectrum refarming because 2G technologies such as Global System for Mobile\n(GSM) is still widely used for low bandwidth machine-to-machine (M2M) devices.\nM2M devices typically have long life cycles, e.g. smart meters, and it is\nexpensive to migrate these devices to newer technology since a truck roll will\ntypically be required to the site where a device is deployed. Furthermore, with\ncost of 2G modules several times less than that of LTE, even newly deployed M2M\ndevices tend to adopt 2G technology. Nevertheless, operators are keen to either\nforce their 2G M2M customers to migrate so that they can refarm the spectrum or\nset aside a portion of the 2G spectrum for continuing operating 2G and only\nrefarm the rest for LTE.

Despite the importance of this quantity in classifying liquids,\nexplaining what aspects of the microscopic structure controls fragility remains\na challenge. Surprisingly, experiments indicate that the linear elasticity of\nthe glass -- a purely local property of the free energy landscape -- is a good\npredictor of fragility. In particular, materials presenting a large excess of\nsoft elastic modes, the so-called boson peak, are strong. This is also the case\nfor network liquids near the rigidity percolation, known to affect elasticity.\nHere we introduce a model of the glass transition based on the assumption that\nparticles can organize locally into distinct configurations, which are coupled\nspatially via elasticity. The model captures the mentioned observations\nconnecting elasticity and fragility. We find that materials presenting an\nabundance of soft elastic modes have little elastic frustration: energy is\ninsensitive to most directions in phase space, leading to a small jump of\nspecific heat. In this framework strong liquids turn out to lie the closest to\na critical point associated with a rigidity or jamming transition, and their\nthermodynamic properties are related to the problem of number partitioning and\nto Hopfield nets in the limit of small memory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Feb 2013 00:40:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 Feb 2013 19:18:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-14"}

The main missing detail is providing a coherent\nchoice of signs when identifying variables in the $sl_2$-homology. Along with\nthe behavior of the signs and local orientations in the $sl_2$-homology, both\ntheories behave differently when we try to extend their definitions to virtual\nlinks, which seemed to suggest that the $sl_2$-homology may instead correspond\nto a different variant of Khovanov homology. In this paper we describe both\ntheories and prove that they are in fact isomorphic by showing that a coherent\nchoice of signs can be made. In doing so we emphasize the interpretation of the\n$sl_2$-complex as a cube of resolutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Feb 2013 01:56:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 May 2013 22:26:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-15"}

These results\nlead to certain lower bounds on the percolation threshold $p_c$ that become\nprogressively tighter as $d$ increases and asymptotically exact as $d$ becomes\nlarge. These lower-bound estimates depend on the structure of the\n$d$-dimensional lattice and whether site or bond percolation is being\nconsidered. We obtain explicit bounds on $p_c$ for both site and bond\npercolation on five different lattices: $d$-dimensional generalizations of the\nsimple-cubic, body-centered-cubic and face-centered-cubic Bravais lattices as\nwell as the $d$-dimensional generalizations of the diamond and kagom{\\'e} (or\npyrochlore) non-Bravais lattices. These analytical estimates are used to assess\navailable simulation results across dimensions (up through $d=13$ in some\ncases). It is noteworthy that the tightest lower bound provides reasonable\nestimates of $p_c$ in relatively low dimensions and becomes increasingly\naccurate as $d$ grows. We also derive high-dimensional asymptotic expansions\nfor $p_c$ for the ten percolation problems and compare them to the\nBethe-lattice approximation. Finally, we remark on the radius of convergence of\nthe series expansion of $S$ in powers of $p$ as the dimension grows.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Feb 2013 01:59:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

By investigating the properties of the detected three major flares\nwith the shortest possible time binning allowed by the photon statistics, we\nfind a variety of temporal characteristics and variability patterns. This\nincludes a clearly asymmetric profile (with a faster flux rise and a slower\ndecay) of the flare resolved on sub-daily timescales, a superposition of many\nshort uncorrelated flaring events forming the apparently coherent\nlonger-duration outburst, and a huge single isolated outburst unresolved down\nto the timescale of three-hours.

The light curves display total eclipses at primary minima and\nseason-to-season light variability. Our synthesis for all available light\ncurves indicates that the eclipsing pair is a W-type overcontact binary with\nparameters of q=2.578, i=83.3 deg, $\\Delta T$=27 K, f=28 %, and l3=2~3 %. The\nasymmetric light curves in 2007 were satisfactorily modeled by a cool spot on\neither of the eclipsing components from a magnetic dynamo. Including our 95\ntiming measurements, a total of 414 times of minimum light spanning about 82 yr\nwere used for a period study. A detailed analysis of the eclipse timing diagram\nrevealed that the orbital period of EP And has varied as a combination of an\nupward-opening parabola and two periodic variations, with cycle lengths of\nP3=44.6 yr and P4=1.834 yr and semi-amplitudes of K3=0.0100 d and K4=0.0039 d,\nrespectively. The observed period increase at a fractional rate of\n+1.39x10^{-10} is in excellent agreement with that calculated from the W-D code\nand can be plausibly explained by some combination of mass transfer from the\nprimary to the secondary star and angular momentum loss due to magnetic\nbraking. The most reasonable explanation for both cycles is a pair of\nlight-travel-time effects driven by the possible existence of a third and\nfourth component with projected masses of M3=0.25 Msun and M4=0.90 Msun. The\nmore massive companion could be revealed using high-resolution spectroscopic\ndata extending over the course of a few years and could also be a binary\nitself. It is possible that the circumbinary objects may have played an\nimportant role in the formation and evolution of the eclipsing pair, which\nwould cause it to have a short initial orbital period and thus evolve into an\novercontact configuration by angular momentum loss.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Feb 2013 10:00:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

The period-luminosity relation slightly depends\non the mass loss rate varying with a factor of three, whereas its dependence on\nthe metal abundance is delta M_bol=0.89 delta log Z. In comparison with\ngalactic red supergiants (Z=0.02) the low metal abundances in red supergiants\nof Magellanic Clouds are responsible for their higher effective temperatures\nand substantially narrower ranges of evolutionary stellar radius change during\nhelium burning. Therefore on the period-mass diagram the red supergiants of\nMagellanic Clouds are located within the strip with width of delta log M =\n0.09, so that the uncertainty of mass evaluation of the red supergiant with the\nknown pulsational period is nearly 25%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Feb 2013 15:56:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

It consists of a computational procedure for\nconstructing meanings of sentences, given their grammatical structure in terms\nof compositional type-logic, and given the empirically derived meanings of\ntheir words. For the particular case that the meaning of words is modelled\nwithin a distributional vector space model, its experimental predictions,\nderived from real large scale data, have outperformed other empirically\nvalidated methods that could build vectors for a full sentence. This success\ncan be attributed to a conceptually motivated mathematical underpinning, by\nintegrating qualitative compositional type-logic and quantitative modelling of\nmeaning within a category-theoretic mathematical framework.\n  The type-logic used in the DisCoCat model is Lambek's pregroup grammar.\nPregroup types form a posetal compact closed category, which can be passed, in\na functorial manner, on to the compact closed structure of vector spaces,\nlinear maps and tensor product. The diagrammatic versions of the equational\nreasoning in compact closed categories can be interpreted as the flow of word\nmeanings within sentences. Pregroups simplify Lambek's previous type-logic, the\nLambek calculus, which has been extensively used to formalise and reason about\nvarious linguistic phenomena. The apparent reliance of the DisCoCat on\npregroups has been seen as a shortcoming. This paper addresses this concern, by\npointing out that one may as well realise a functorial passage from the\noriginal type-logic of Lambek, a monoidal bi-closed category, to vector spaces,\nor to any other model of meaning organised within a monoidal bi-closed\ncategory. The corresponding string diagram calculus, due to Baez and Stay, now\ndepicts the flow of word meanings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Feb 2013 15:57:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-21"}

Then, the model is extended to the case of two\njunctions, and finally to a regular city. The system still presents mainly four\nphases. The role of a critical circuit of non-priority roads appears clearly in\nthe two junctions case. In Section 4, we use traffic light controls to improve\nthe traffic diagram.
