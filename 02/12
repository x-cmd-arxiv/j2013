One can\nscale these models by changing the mass of the particle and in the small mass\nlimit one has almost sure uniform convergence in distribution to the standard\nidealized model of mathematical Brownian motion. This provides one well known\nway of realising the Wiener process. However, this result is less robust than\nit would appear and important generic functionals of the trajectories of the\nphysical Brownian motion do not necessarily converge to the same functionals of\nBrownian motion when one takes the small mass limit. In presence of a magnetic\nfield the area process associated to the physical process converges - but not\nto L\\'evy's stochastic area. As this area is felt generically in settings where\nthe particle interacts through force fields in a nonlinear way, the remark is\nphysically significant and indicates that classical Brownian motion, with its\nusual stochastic calculus, is not an appropriate model for the limiting\nbehaviour.\n  We compute explicitly the area correction term and establish convergence, in\nthe small mass limit, of the physical Brownian motion in the rough path sense.\nThe small mass limit for the motion of a charged particle in the presence of a\nmagnetic field is, in distribution, an easily calculable, but \"non-canonical\"\nrough path lift of Brownian motion. Viewing the trajectory of a charged\nBrownian particle with small mass as a rough path is informative and allows one\nto retain information that would be lost if one only considered it as a\nclassical trajectory.

We subsequently show that this new framework allows us to\ndevise a simple and fast quadratic programming method to recover the smoothest\nRND whose corresponding put prices lie inside the bid-ask quotes. This method\nis termed the spectral recovery method (SRM). Interestingly, the SVD of the\nrestricted put and call operators sheds some new light on the RND recovery\nproblem. The SRM improves on other RND recovery methods in the sense that:\n  - it is fast and simple to implement since it requires solution of a single\nquadratic program, while being fully nonparametric; - it takes the bid ask\nquotes as sole input and does not require any sort of calibration, smoothing or\npreprocessing of the data; - it is robust to the paucity of price quotes; - it\nreturns the smoothest density giving rise to prices that lie inside the bid ask\nquotes. The estimated RND is therefore as well-behaved as can be; - it returns\na closed form estimate of the RND on the interval [0,B] of the positive real\nline, where B is a positive constant that can be chosen arbitrarily. We thus\nobtain both the middle part of the RND together with its full left tail and\npart of its right tail.\n  We confront this method to both real and simulated data and observe that it\nfares well in practice.

In this article, we answer their original question.\nMore than that, we do so under all combinations of the following two critical\nvariations on the underlying model of distributed computing:\n  ($B$): the size of the identifiers is bounded by a function of the size of\nthe input network; as opposed to ($\\neg B$): the identifiers are unbounded.\n  ($C$): the nodes run a computable algorithm; as opposed to ($\\neg C$): the\nnodes can compute any, possibly uncomputable function.\n  While it is easy to see that under ($\\neg B, \\neg C$) identifiers are not\nneeded, we show that under all other combinations there are properties that can\nbe decided locally if and only if identifiers are present. Our constructions\nuse ideas from classical computability theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Feb 2013 18:51:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-24"}

But some\nquestions remain: how does a bead glued at the end of a cantilever influence\nits mechanical response ? And more important for quantitative measurements, can\nwe still determine the stiffness of the AFM probe with traditional techniques?\nIn this article, the influence of a colloidal mass loading on the eigenmodes\nshape and resonant frequency is investigated by measuring the thermal noise on\nrectangular AFM microcantilevers with and without a bead attached at their\nextremities. The experiments are performed with a home-made ultra-sensitive\nAFM, based on differential interferometry. The focused beam from the\ninterferometer probes the cantilever at different positions and the spatial\nshapes of the modes are determined up to the fifth resonance, without external\nexcitation. The results clearly demonstrate that the first eigenmode almost\ndoesn't change by mass loading. However the oscillation behavior of higher\nresonances present a marked difference: with a particle glued at its extremity,\nthe nodes of the mode are displaced towards the free end of the cantilever.\nThese results are compared to an analytical model taking into account the mass\nand the inertial moment of the load in an Euler-Bernoulli framework, where the\nnormalization of the eigenmodes is explicitly worked out in order to allow a\nquantitative prediction of the thermal noise amplitude of each mode. A good\nagreement between the experimental results and the analytical model is\ndemonstrated, allowing a clean calibration of the probe stiffness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Feb 2013 19:42:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 May 2013 06:58:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-09"}

In our model, we investigate the\ndistortion of the ellipticity field if the galaxies experience an apparent\nshift in their position by weak lensing deflection and compare this effect to\nthe shearing effect induced by tidal fields. Starting with a derivation of\nintrinsic ellipticity spectra by employing a tidal torquing model generating\ngalactic angular momenta, we model the galaxy ellipticity by assuming that the\ngalactic disk forms perpendicularly to the host halo angular momentum direction\nand derive intrinsic ellipticity E-mode and B-mode spectra from the angular\nmomentum statistics. The lensing effect on the ellipticity field is modeled by\nemploying the methodology developed in the framework of lensing of the cosmic\nmicrowave background polarisation. For EUCLID, ellipticity correlations are\naltered by lensing deflection on multipoles l>1000 by ~5% for the ellipticity\nE-modes and by ~30% for the B-modes, while a shallower survey would exhibit\nlarger changes on larger angular scales. In addition to the convolving effect\nof lensing on the ellipticity spectra we investigate the E/B-mode conversion,\nand discuss the possibility of measuring correlations between different\nmultipoles which is evoked by the homogeneity breaking effect of the lensing\ndisplacement. Our conclusion is that although shape correlations generated by\nweak gravitational shear is dominant, the shifting effect due to lensing is\nshaping the ellipticity spectra on small angular scales and causes a number of\ninteresting phenomena, which might be observable by future surveys.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Feb 2013 20:43:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

This grid of\n3D models is intended for various applications like stellar spectroscopy,\nasteroseismology and the study of stellar convection. In this introductory\npaper, we describe the methods used for the computation of the grid and discuss\nthe general properties of the 3D models as well as their temporal and spatial\naverages (<3D>). All our models were generated with the Stagger-code, using\nrealistic input physics for the equation of state (EOS) and for continuous and\nline opacities. Our ~220 grid models range in Teff from 4000 to 7000K in steps\nof 500K, in log g from 1.5 to 5.0 in steps of 0.5 dex, and [Fe/H] from -4.0 to\n+0.5 in steps of 0.5 and 1.0 dex. We find a tight scaling relation between the\nvertical velocity and the surface entropy jump, which itself correlates with\nthe constant entropy value of the adiabatic convection zone. The range in\nintensity contrast is enhanced at lower metallicity. The granule size\ncorrelates closely with the pressure scale height sampled at the depth of\nmaximum velocity. We compare the <3D> models with widely applied 1D models, as\nwell as with theoretical 1D hydrostatic models generated with the same EOS and\nopacity tables as the 3D models, in order to isolate the effects of using\nself-consistent and hydrodynamic modeling of convection, rather than the\nclassical mixing length theory approach. For the first time, we are able to\nquantify systematically over a broad range of stellar parameters the\nuncertainties of 1D models arising from the simplified treatment of physics, in\nparticular convective energy transport.

The processes\nresponsible for the removal of the dust and gas will strongly modify the radial\ndistribution of the dust and consequently the SED. In particular, a young\nplanet will open a gap, resulting in an inner disk dominating the near-IR\nemission and an outer disk emitting mostly in the far-IR. We analyze a full set\nof data (including VLTI/Pionier, VLTI/Midi, and VLT/NaCo/Sam) to constrain the\nstructure of the transition disk around TCha. We used the Mcfost radiative\ntransfer code to simultaneously model the SED and the interferometric\nobservations. We find that the dust responsible for the emission in excess in\nthe near-IR must have a narrow temperature distribution with a maximum close to\nthe silicate sublimation temperature. This translates into a narrow inner dusty\ndisk (0.07-0.11 AU). We find that the outer disk starts at about 12 AU and is\npartially resolved by the Pionier, Sam, and Midi instruments. We show that the\nSam closure phases, interpreted as the signature of a candidate companion, may\nactually trace the asymmetry generated by forward scattering by dust grains in\nthe upper layers of the outer disk. These observations help constrain the\ninclination and position angle of the outer disk. The presence of matter inside\nthe gap is difficult to assess with present-day observations. Our model\nsuggests the outer disk contaminates the interferometric signature of any\npotential companion that could be responsible for the gap opening, and such a\ncompanion still has to be unambiguously detected.

In radiative disks an additional component of the corotation\ntorque scaling with the entropy gradient across the horseshoe region can\ncounteract the general inward migration, Type I migration can then be directed\neither inward or outward depending on the local disk properties. Thus, special\nlocations exist in the disk toward which planets migrate in a convergent way.\n  Here we present N-body simulations of the convergent migration of systems of\nlow-mass (M=1-10 m_earth) planets. We show that planets do not actually\nconverge in convergence zones. Rather, they become trapped in chains of mean\nmotion resonances (MMRs). This causes the planets' eccentricities to increase\nto high enough values to affect the structure of the horseshoe region and\nweaken the positive corotation torque. The zero-torque equilibrium point of the\nresonant chain of planets is determined by the sum of the attenuated corotation\ntorques and unattenuated differential Lindblad torques acting on each planet.\n  The effective convergence zone is shifted inward. Systems with several\nplanets can experience stochastic migration as a whole due to continuous\nperturbations from planets entering and leaving resonances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Feb 2013 21:00:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

One of the proposed\nprogenitor theories is the single-degenerate channel in which a white dwarf\naccretes from a companion, grows in mass, reaches a critical mass limit, and is\nthen consumed after thermonuclear runaway sets in. However, there are major\ndisagreements about the theoretical delay time distribution and the\ncorresponding time-integrated supernova Ia rate from this channel. We\ninvestigate whether the differences are due to the uncertainty in the common\nenvelope phase and the fraction of transferred mass that is retained by the\nwhite dwarf. This so-called retention efficiency may have a strong influence on\nthe final amount and timing of supernovae Ia. Using the population synthesis\ncode SeBa, we simulated large numbers of binaries for various assumptions on\ncommon envelopes and retention efficiencies.

For the three assumed retention\nefficiencies, the integrated rate varies by a factor 3-4 to even more than a\nfactor 100, so in extreme cases, the retention efficiency strongly suppresses\nthe single-degenerate channel.

Besides clustering in halos, the universal character of gravity\nimplies that self-gravitating compact DM configurations might be spread\nthroughout the universe. The astrophysical signature of these objects may be\nused to probe fundamental particle physics, or even to provide an alternative\ndescription of compact objects in active galactic nuclei. Here we discuss the\nmost promising dissection tool of these configurations: the inspiral of a\ncompact stellar-size object and consequent gravitational-wave emission. The\ninward motion of this \"test probe\" encodes unique information about the nature\nof the central, supermassive DM configuration. When the probe travels through\nsome compact DM profile we show that, within a Newtonian approximation, the\nquasi-adiabatic evolution of the inspiral is mainly driven by DM accretion into\nthe small compact object and by dynamical friction, rather than by\ngravitational-wave radiation-reaction. These effects circularize the orbits and\nleave a peculiar imprint on the gravitational waves emitted at late time. When\naccretion dominates, the frequency and the amplitude of the gravitational-wave\nsignal produced during the latest stages of the inspiral are nearly constant.\nIn the exterior region we study a relativistic model in which the inspiral is\ndriven by the emission of gravitational and scalar waves. Resonances in the\nenergy flux appear whenever the orbital frequency matches the mass of the DM\nparticle and they correspond to the excitation of the central object's\nquasinormal frequencies. Unexpectedly, these resonances can lead to large\ndephasing with respect to standard inspiral templates, to such an extent as to\nprevent detection with matched filtering techniques. We discuss some\nobservational consequences of these effects for gravitational-wave detection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Feb 2013 21:15:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 24 May 2013 14:52:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

With the goal of increasing the\nnumber of bright lensed galaxies available for detailed follow-up, we have\nundertaken a spectroscopic campaign targeting wide separation (>3 arcsec)\ngalaxy-galaxy lens candidates within the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS).\nBuilding on the earlier efforts of our CASSOWARY survey, we target a large\nsample of candidate galaxy-galaxy lens systems in SDSS using a well-established\nsearch algorithm which identifies blue arc-like structures situated around\nluminous red galaxies. In this paper, we present a new redshift catalog\ncontaining 25 lensed sources in SDSS confirmed through spectroscopic follow-up\nof candidate galaxy-galaxy lens systems. Included in this new sample are two of\nthe brightest galaxies (r=19.6 and 19.7) galaxies known at z~2, a low\nmetallicity (12 + log (O/H)~8.0) extreme nebular line emitting galaxy at\nz=1.43, and numerous systems for which detailed follow-up will be possible. The\nsource redshifts span 0.9<z<2.5 (median redshift of 1.9), and their optical\nmagnitudes are in the range 19.6<r<22.3. We present a brief source-by-source\ndiscussion of the spectroscopic properties extracted from our confirmatory\nspectra and discuss some initial science results. With more than 50\ngravitationally lensed z>1 galaxies now confirmed within SDSS, it will soon be\npossible for the first time to develop generalized conclusions from detailed\nspectroscopic studies of the brightest lensed systems at high redshift.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Feb 2013 22:59:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

Within the\nstrongly self-shielded interior of the Orion A cloud, the 13CO abundance varies\nby 100% with a peak value located near regions of enhanced star formation\nactivity. The effect of CO depletion onto the ice mantles of dust grains is\nlimited to regions with AV > 10 mag and gas temperatures less than 20 K as\npredicted by chemical models that consider thermal-evaporation to desorb\nmolecules from grain surfaces.\n  Values of the molecular mass of each cloud are independently derived from the\ndistributions of Av and 13CO column densities with a constant 13CO-to-H2\nabundance over various extinction ranges. Within the strongly self-shielded\ninterior of the cloud (Av > 3 mag), 13CO provides a reliable tracer of H2 mass\nwith the exception of the cold, dense volumes where depletion is important.\nHowever, owing to its reduced abundance, 13CO does not trace the H2 mass that\nresides in the extended cloud envelope, which comprises 40-50% of the molecular\nmass of each cloud. The implied CO luminosity to mass ratios, M/L_{CO}, are 3.2\nand 2.9 for Orion A and Orion B respectively, which are comparable to the value\n(2.9), derived from gamma-ray observations of the Orion region. Our results\nemphasize the need to consider local conditions when applying CO observations\nto derive H2 column densities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Feb 2013 00:59:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

For covariance matrices of low separation rank,\nour results establish that PRLS has significantly faster convergence than the\nstandard sample covariance matrix (SCM) estimator. The convergence rate\ncaptures a fundamental tradeoff between estimation error and approximation\nerror, thus providing a scalable covariance estimation framework in terms of\nseparation rank, similar to low rank approximation of covariance matrices. The\nMSE convergence rates generalize the high dimensional rates recently obtained\nfor the ML Flip-flop algorithm for Kronecker product covariance estimation.

Uncovering the evolutionary history of all variants is\ntherefore of intrinsic interest for complex disease research. However, doing so\nnecessitates the simultaneous elucidation of the targets of natural selection\nand population-specific demographic history. Here we characterize the action of\nnatural selection operating across complex disease categories, and use\npopulation genetic simulations to evaluate the expected patterns of genetic\nvariation in large samples.

In addition, loci identified through genome-wide association\nstudies of complex traits also exhibit signatures consistent with being in\nregions recurrently targeted by purifying selection. Through simulations, we\nshow that population bottlenecks and rapid growth enables deleterious rare\nvariants to persist at low frequencies just as long as neutral variants, but\nlow frequency and common variants tend to be much younger than neutral\nvariants.

The algorithm from [3] used a\nsequence of inner total variation minimizations to guarantee descent of the\nbalanced cut energy as well as convergence of the algorithm. In practice the\ntotal variation minimization step is never solved exactly. Instead, an accuracy\nparameter is specified and the total variation minimization terminates once\nthis level of accuracy is reached. The choice of this parameter can vastly\nimpact both the computational time of the overall algorithm as well as the\naccuracy of the result. Moreover, since the total variation minimization step\nis not solved exactly, the algorithm is not guarantied to be monotonic. In the\npresent work we introduce a new adaptive stopping condition for the total\nvariation minimization that guarantees monotonicity. This results in an\nalgorithm that is actually monotonic in practice and is also significantly\nfaster than previous, non-adaptive algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Feb 2013 06:50:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-13"}

It is shown\nhere that in shearing deformations the corresponding normal stress distribution\ncan exhibit extreme sensitivity to changes in Poisson's ratio. These changes\ncan even lead to a reversal of the usual Poynting effect. Therefore the usual\npractice of arbitrarily choosing a value of Poisson's ratio when numerically\nmodelling rubbers and soft tissue will, almost certainly, lead to a significant\ndifference between the simulated and actual normal stresses in a sheared block\nbecause of the difference between the assumed and actual value of Poisson's\nratio. The worrying conclusion is that simulations based on arbitrarily\nspecifying Poisson's ratio close to 1/2 cannot accurately predict the normal\nstress distribution even for the simplest of shearing deformations. It is shown\nanalytically that this sensitivity is due to the small volume changes which\ninevitably accompany all deformations of rubber-like materials. To minimise\nthese effects, great care should be exercised to accurately determine Poisson's\nratio before simulations begin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Feb 2013 09:04:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-13"}

For this purpose we use\ncollisionless N-body simulations of dwarfs initially composed of a disk\nembedded in an NFW dark matter halo. The dwarfs are placed on seven orbits\naround the Milky Way-like host, differing in size and eccentricity, and their\nevolution is followed for 10 Gyr. In addition to the well-studied morphological\nand dynamical transformation of the dwarf's main body, the tidal stripping\ncauses them to lose a substantial fraction of mass both in dark matter and\nstars which form pronounced tidal tails. We focus on the properties of the\nstellar component of the tidal tails thus formed. We first discuss the break\nradii in the stellar density profile defining the transition to tidal tails as\nthe radii where the profile becomes shallower and relate them to the\nclassically defined tidal radii. We then calculate the relative density and\nvelocity of the tails at a few break radii as a function of the orbital phase.\nNext, we measure the orientation of the tails with respect to an observer\nplaced at the centre of the Milky Way. The tails are perpendicular to this line\nof sight only for a short period of time near the pericentre. For most of the\ntime the angles between the tails and this line of sight are low, with\norbit-averaged medians below 42 degrees for all, even the almost circular\norbit. The median angle is typically lower while the maximum relative density\nhigher for more eccentric orbits. The combined effects of relative density and\norientation of the tails suggest that they should be easiest to detect for\ndwarf galaxies soon after their pericentre passage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Feb 2013 09:55:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 May 2013 08:41:09 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 17 Jun 2013 12:22:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-12"}

We analyze\ndeep X-ray observations of the Orion massive star-forming region using the\nChandra Orion Ultradeep Project (COUP) catalog. We studied the stellar\ndistribution as a function of extinction, with cells of 0.03 pc x 0.03 pc, the\ntypical size of protostellar cores. We derived stellar density maps and\ncalculated cluster stellar densities. We found that low-mass stars cluster\ntoward the three massive star-forming regions: the Trapezium Cluster (TC), the\nOrion Hot Core (OHC), and OMC1-S. We derived low-mass stellar densities of\n10^{5} stars pc^{-3} in the TC and OMC1-S, and of 10^{6} stars pc^{-3} in the\nOHC. The close association between the low-mass star clusters with massive star\ncradles supports the role of these clusters in the formation of massive stars.\nThe X-ray observations show for the first time in the TC that low-mass stars\nwith intermediate extinction are clustered toward the position of the most\nmassive star, which is surrounded by a ring of non-extincted low-mass stars.\nThis 'envelope-core' structure is also supported by infrared and optical\nobservations. Our analysis suggests that at least two basic ingredients are\nneeded in massive star formation: the presence of dense gas and a cluster of\nlow-mass stars. The scenario that better explains our findings assumes high\nfragmentation in the parental core, accretion at subcore scales that forms a\nlow-mass stellar cluster, and subsequent competitive accretion. Finally,\nalthough coalescence does not seem a common mechanism for building up massive\nstars, we show that a single stellar merger may have occurred in the evolution\nof the OHC cluster, favored by the presence of disks, binaries, and gas\naccretion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Feb 2013 11:42:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

A model for inertia\n(MiHsC or quantised inertia) has been suggested that assumes that 1) inertia is\ndue to Unruh radiation and 2) this radiation is subject to a Hubble-scale\nCasimir effect. This model has no adjustable parameters and predicts the cosmic\nacceleration, and galaxy rotation without dark matter, suggesting that Unruh\nradiation indeed causes inertia, but the exact mechanism by which it does this\nhas not been specified. The mechanism suggested here is that when an object\naccelerates, for example to the right, a dynamical (Rindler) event horizon\nforms to its left, reducing the Unruh radiation on that side by a Rindler-scale\nCasimir effect whereas the radiation on the other side is only slightly reduced\nby a Hubble-scale Casimir effect. This produces an imbalance in the radiation\npressure on the object, and a net force that always opposes acceleration, like\ninertia. A formula for inertia is derived, and an experimental test is\nsuggested.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Feb 2013 12:52:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

Toroidally and vertically-directed\ncollection lenses are employed, to detect both passing and trapped particle\ndynamics, and reference views are installed to subtract the background. This\nbackground is found to contain a substantial amount of passive FIDA emission\ndriven by edge neutrals, and to depend delicately on viewing geometry. Results\nare compared with theoretical expectations based on the codes NUBEAM (for fast\nion distributions) and FIDASIM. Calibrating via the measured beam emission\npeaks, the toroidal FIDA signal profile agrees with classical simulations in\nMHD quiescent discharges where the neutron rate is also classical. Long-lived\nmodes (LLM) and chirping modes decrease the core FIDA signal significantly, and\nthe profile can be matched closely to simulations using anomalous diffusive\ntransport; a spatially uniform diffusion coefficient is sufficient for chirping\nmodes, while a core localized diffusion is better for a LLM. Analysis of a\ndischarge with chirping mode activity shows a dramatic drop in the core FIDA\nsignal and rapid increase in the edge passive signal at the onset of the burst\nindicating a very rapid redistribution towards the edge. Vertical viewing\nmeasurements show a discrepancy with simulations at higher Doppler shifts when\nthe neutron rate is classical, which, combined with the fact that the toroidal\nsignals agree, means that the difference must be occurring for pitch angles\nnear the trapped-passing boundary. Further evidence of an anomalous transport\nmechanism for these particles is provided by the fact that an increase of beam\npower does not increase the higher energy vertical FIDA signals, while the\ntoroidal signals do increase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Feb 2013 12:53:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-13"}

Vacuum expectation values, expressed as series\ninvolving the eigenvalues of the radial quantum number, are neatly decomposed\ninto boundary-free, single-boundary-induced, and second-boundary-induced parts,\nwith the help of the generalized Abel-Plana summation formula. In this way, the\nrenormalization procedure is very conveniently reduced to the one corresponding\nto boundary-free AdS spacetime.

Here, I calculate the distribution of the number of node neighbors in\nrandom hypergraphs in which hyperedges of uniform rank $r$ have a homogeneous\nprobability $p$ to appear. This distribution is equivalent to the degree\ndistribution of ensembles of projected graphs from hypergraph or bipartite\nnetwork ensembles, where the projection connects any two nodes in the projected\ngraph when they are also connected in the hypergraph or bipartite network. The\ncalculation is non-trivial due to the possibility that neighbor nodes belong\nsimultaneously to multiple hyperedges (node overlaps). From the exact results,\nthe traditional sparse (small $p$) asymptotic approximation to the distribution\nis rederived and improved; the approximation exhibits Poisson-like behavior\naccompanied by strong fluctuations modulated by power-law decays in the system\nsize $N$ with decay exponents equal to the minimum number of overlapping nodes\npossible for a given number of neighbors. It is shown that the dense limit\ncannot be explained if overlaps are ignored, and the correct asymptotic\ndistribution is provided. The neighbor distribution requires the calculation of\na new combinatorial coefficient $Q_{r-1}(k,\\ell)$, counting the number of\ndistinct labelled hypergraphs of $k$ nodes, $\\ell$ hyperedges of rank $r-1$,\nand where every node is connected to at least one hyperedge. Some identities of\n$Q_{r-1}(k,\\ell)$ are derived and applied to the verification of normalization\nand the calculation of moments of the neighbor distribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Feb 2013 15:51:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 14 Jun 2013 17:42:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-11"}

In spite of this,\nthe so called `null results' of the classical ether-drift experiments,\ntraditionally interpreted as confirmations of Special Relativity, have so\ndeeply influenced scientific thought as to prevent a critical discussion on the\nreal reasons underlying its alleged supremacy. In this paper, we argue that\nthis traditional null interpretation is far from obvious. In fact, by using\nLorentz transformations to connect the Earth's frame to Sigma, the small\nobserved effects point to an average Earth's velocity of about 300 km/s, as in\nmost cosmic motions. A common feature is the irregular behaviour of the data.\nWhile this has motivated, so far, their standard interpretation as instrumental\nartifacts, our new re-analysis of the very accurate Joos experiment gives clear\nindications for the type of Earth's motion associated with the CMB anisotropy\nand leaves little space for this traditional interpretation. The new\nexplanation requires instead a view of the vacuum as a stochastic medium,\nsimilar to a fluid in a turbulent state of motion, in agreement with basic\nfoundational aspects of both quantum physics and relativity. The overall\nconsistency of this picture with the present experiments with vacuum optical\nresonators and the need for a new generation of dedicated ether-drift\nexperiments are also emphasized.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Feb 2013 08:10:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 6 Jun 2013 08:59:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-22"}
