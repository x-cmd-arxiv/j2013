In this paper, we\nintroduce novel interference mitigation schemes for wireless cellular networks\nwith space division multiple access (SDMA). The schemes are based on a virtual\nlayer that captures and simplifies the complicated interference situation in\nthe network and that is used for power control. We show how optimization in\nthis virtual layer generates gradually adapting power control settings that\nlead to autonomous interference minimization. Thereby, the granularity of\ncontrol ranges from controlling frequency sub-band power via controlling the\npower on a per-beam basis, to a granularity of only enforcing average power\nconstraints per beam. In conjunction with suitable short-term scheduling, our\nalgorithms gradually steer the network towards a higher utility. We use\nextensive system-level simulations to compare three distributed algorithms and\nevaluate their applicability for different user mobility assumptions. In\nparticular, it turns out that larger gains can be achieved by imposing average\npower constraints and allowing opportunistic scheduling instantaneously, rather\nthan controlling the power in a strict way. Furthermore, we introduce a\ncentralized algorithm, which directly solves the underlying optimization and\nshows fast convergence, as a performance benchmark for the distributed\nsolutions.

While\nnegative abundance gradients today provide a boundary condition for galaxy\nevolution models, in support of inside-out disc growth, empirical evidence as\nto whether abundance gradients steepen or flatten with time remains highly\ncontradictory. We made use of a suite of L* discs, realised with and without\n`enhanced' feedback.

The `enhanced' feedback models, which have been shown to be in\nagreement with a broad range of empirical scaling relations, distribute energy\nand re-cycled ISM material over large scales and predict the existence of\nrelatively `flat' and temporally invariant abundance gradients. Enhanced\nfeedback schemes reduce significantly the scatter in the local stellar\nage-metallicity relation and, especially, the [O/Fe]-[Fe/H] relation. The local\n[O/Fe] distribution functions for our L* discs show clear bimodality, with\npeaks at [O/Fe]=-0.05 and +0.05 (for stars with [Fe/H]>-1), consistent with our\nearlier work on dwarf discs.

We extend Fourier-Motzkin elimination to semi-infinite linear\nprograms which are linear programs with finitely many variables and infinitely\nmany constraints. Applying projection leads to new characterizations of\nimportant properties for primal-dual pairs of semi-infinite programs such as\nzero duality gap, feasibility, boundedness, and solvability. Extending the\nFourier-Motzkin elimination procedure to semi-infinite linear programs yields a\nnew classification of variables that is used to determine the existence of\nduality gaps. In particular, the existence of what the authors term dirty\nvariables can lead to duality gaps. Our approach has interesting applications\nin finite-dimensional convex optimization. For example, sufficient conditions\nfor a zero duality gap, such as existence of a Slater point, are reduced to\nguaranteeing that there are no dirty variables.

Because observed\nstarless cores resemble Bonnor-Ebert density structures, the stability and\ndynamics of the starless cores are frequently analyzed by comparing to the\nconventional stability condition of a hydrostatic Bonnor-Ebert sphere. However,\nstarless cores are not hydrostatic but have observed internal motions. In this\nstudy, we take gaseous spheres with a homologous internal velocity field and\nderive stability conditions of the spheres utilizing a virial analysis. We\npropose two limiting models of spontaneous gravitational collapse: the collapse\nof critical Bonnor-Ebert spheres and uniform density spheres. The collapse of\nthese two limiting models are intended to provide the lower and the upper\nlimits, respectively, of the infall speeds for a given density structure. The\nresults of our study suggest that the stability condition sensitively depends\non internal motions. A homologous inward motion with a transonic speed can\nreduce the critical size compared to the static Bonnor-Ebert sphere by more\nthan a factor of two. As an application of the two limiting models of\nspontaneous gravitational collapse, we compare the density structures and\ninfall speeds of the observed starless cores L63, L1544, L1689B, and L694-2 to\nthe two limiting models. L1689B and L694-2 seem to have been perturbed to\nresult in faster infall motions than for spontaneous gravitational collapse.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Apr 2013 18:03:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

However, if one considers traceless energy-momentum tensor for the\nmatter source as well as constant scalar curvature, one can derive some exact\nanalytical solutions from $f(R)$ theory coupled to a matter field. In this\npaper, by assuming constant curvature scalar, we construct a class of charged\nrotating black string solutions in $f(R)$-Maxwell theory. We study the physical\nproperties and obtain the conserved quantities of the solutions. The conserved\nand thermodynamic quantities computed here depend on function $f'(R_{0})$ and\ndiffer completely from those of Einstein theory in AdS spaces. Besides, unlike\nEinstein gravity, the entropy does not obey the area law. We also investigate\nthe validity of the first law of thermodynamics as well as the stability\nanalysis in the canonical ensemble, and show that the black string solutions\nare always thermodynamically stable in $f(R)$-Maxwell theory with constant\ncurvature scalar. Finally, we extend the study to the case where the Ricci\nscalar is not a constant and in particular $R=R(r)$. In this case, by using the\nLagrangian multipliers method, we derive an analytical black string solution\nfrom $f(R)$ gravity and reconstructed the function $R(r)$. We find that this\nclass of solutions has an additional logaritmic term in the metric function\nwhich incorporates the effect of the $f(R)$ theory in the solutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Apr 2013 19:14:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 11 Apr 2013 17:28:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 12 Apr 2013 13:54:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-15"}

Traditional methods (FOBI, Kernel-ICA, FastICA) originating from\nthe engineering literature have consistency that requires moment conditions\nwithout achieving any type of asymptotic efficiency. When based on robust\nscatter matrices, the two-scatter methods developed by Oja, et al. (2006) and\nNordhausen, et al. (2008) enjoy better robustness features but have unclear\noptimality properties. The semiparametric approach by Chen and Bickel (2006)\nachieves semiparametric efficiency but requires estimating the k unobserved\nindependent component densities. As a reaction, an efficient\n(signed-)rank-based approach has been proposed by Ilmonen and Paindaveine\n(2011) for the case of symmetric component densities that fail to be root-n\nconsistent as soon as one of the component densities is asymmetric. In this\npaper, using ranks rather than signed ranks, we extend their approach to the\nasymmetric case and propose a one-step R-estimator for ICA mixing matrices. The\nfinite-sample performances of those estimators are investigated and compared to\nthose of existing methods under moderately large sample sizes. Particularly\ngood performances are obtained when using data-driven scores taking into\naccount the skewness and kurtosis of residuals. Finally, we show, by an\nempirical exercise, that our methods also may provide excellent results in a\ncontext such as image analysis, where the basic assumptions of ICA are quite\nunlikely to hold.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Apr 2013 19:56:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Dec 2013 21:05:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-17"}

One approach is to posit\nthat nature selects a worst-case distribution for any stochastic primitives\nfrom some pre-specified family. Several communities have observed that a subtle\nphenomena known as time inconsistency can arise in this framework. In\nparticular, it becomes possible that a policy which is optimal at time zero may\nnot be optimal for the associated optimization problem in which the\ndecision-maker recomputes her policy at each point in time, which has\nimplications for implementability. If there exists a policy which is optimal\nfor both formulations, we say that the policy is time consistent, and the\nproblem is weakly time consistent. If every optimal policy is time consistent,\nwe say that the problem is strongly time consistent. We study these phenomena\nin the context of managing an inventory over time, when only the mean,\nvariance, and support are known for the demand at each stage. We provide\nseveral illustrative examples showing that here the question of time\nconsistency can be quite subtle, and complement these observations by providing\nsimple sufficient conditions for weak and strong time consistency.\nInterestingly, our results show that time consistency may hold even when\nrectangularity does not. Although a similar phenomena was previously identified\nby Shapiro for the setting in which only the mean and support of the demand are\nknown, there the problem was always weakly time consistent, with both\nformulations having the same optimal value. Here our model is rich enough to\nexhibit a variety of interesting behaviors, including lack of weak time\nconsistency, strong time consistency even when both formulations have different\noptimal values, and non-existence of even a single optimal base-stock policy\nunder the static formulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Apr 2013 19:58:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 Mar 2015 20:19:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 20 Aug 2018 16:53:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-21"}

To solve the diffusion equation, we use standard finite-difference\nmethods, which for multi-dimensional problems could also include splitting on\nvarious dimensions. For the jump part, we transform the jump integral into a\npseudo-differential operator. Then for various jump models we show how to\nconstruct an appropriate first and second order approximation on a grid which\nsupersets the grid that we used for the diffusion part.

The period, amplitude, and phase of this modulation are\nconstant within errors over 16 months. The spectrum of SDSS J1036+6522 shows\nmagnetic splitting of carbon lines, and we use Paschen-Back formalism to\ndevelop a grid of model atmospheres for mixed carbon and helium atmospheres.\nOur models, while reliant on several simplistic assumptions, nevertheless match\nthe major spectral and photometric properties of the star with a\nself-consistent set of parameters: Teff~15,500 K, log g ~9, log(C/He)=-1.0, and\na mean magnetic field strength of 3.0 +/- 0.2 MG.

Tens of quasars are now known to be located behind the Giant\nStellar Stream, and hundreds behind the extended halo and its associated\nsubstructures of M31. The much enlarged sample of known quasars in the vicinity\nof M31 and M33 can potentially be utilized to construct a perfect astrometric\nreference frame to measure the minute PMs of M31 and M33, along with the PMs of\nsubstructures associated with the Local Group of galaxies. Those PMs are some\nof the most fundamental properties of the Local Group.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Apr 2013 00:58:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

In these systems, a\ncentral encoder is connected to multiple multi-antenna base stations (BSs) via\nfinite-capacity backhaul links. At the central encoder, precoding is followed\nby compression in order to produce the rate-limited bit streams delivered to\neach BS over the corresponding backhaul link. In current state-of-the-art\napproaches, the signals intended for different BSs are compressed\nindependently. In contrast, this work proposes to leverage joint compression,\nalso referred to as multivariate compression, of the signals of different BSs\nin order to better control the effect of the additive quantization noises at\nthe mobile stations (MSs). The problem of maximizing the weighted sum-rate with\nrespect to both the precoding matrix and the joint correlation matrix of the\nquantization noises is formulated subject to power and backhaul capacity\nconstraints. An iterative algorithm is proposed that achieves a stationary\npoint of the problem. Moreover, in order to enable the practical implementation\nof multivariate compression across BSs, a novel architecture is proposed based\non successive steps of minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) estimation and per-BS\ncompression. Robust design with respect to imperfect channel state information\nis also discussed.

At this frequency the detection noise\nfloor of our system is of 3 pW/Hz and the long-term phase stability is <3\ndegrees/h, limited by the mechanical stability of the apparatus.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Apr 2013 06:36:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-12"}

The detection of LBGs in\nthe FIR domain can provide very important clues on their dust attenuation and\ntotal SFR, allowing a more detailed study than those performed so far. In this\nwork we explore the FIR emission of a sample of 16 LBGs at z ~ 3 in the\nGOODS-North and GOODS-South fields that are individually detected in PACS-100um\nor PACS-160um. These detections demonstrate the possibility of measuring the\ndust emission of LBGs at high redshift. We find that PACS-detected LBGs at z ~\n3 are highly obscured galaxies which belong to the Ultra luminous IR galaxies\nor Hyper luminous IR galaxies class. Their total SFR cannot be recovered with\nthe dust attenuation factors obtained from their UV continuum slope or their\nSED-derived dust attenuation employing Bruzual & Charlot (2003) templates. Both\nmethods underestimate the results for most of the galaxies. Comparing with a\nsample of PACS-detected LBGs at z ~ 1 we find evidences that the FIR emission\nof LBGs might have changed with redshift in the sense that the dustiest LBGs\nfound at z ~ 3 have more prominent FIR emission, are dustier for a given UV\nslope, and have higher SFR for a given stellar mass than the dustiest LBGs\nfound at z ~ 1.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Apr 2013 08:10:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

The real difficulty in understanding detailed microscopic aspects of\nsuch transitions in molecular systems arises from the interplay between\ndifferent energy and length scales involved in molecular systems, often\nmediated through a solvent. In this work we employ Monte Carlo (MC) simulations\nto study the collapse transition in a model molecular system interacting via\nboth isotropic as well as anisotropic interactions having different length and\nenergy scales. The model we use is known as Mercedes-Benz (MB) which for a\nspecific set of parameters sustains three solid phases: honeycomb, oblique and\ntriangular. In order to study the temperature induced collapse transition, we\nstart with a metastable honeycomb solid and induce transition by heating. High\ndensity oblique solid so formed has two characteristic length scales\ncorresponding to isotropic and anisotropic parts of interaction potential.\nContrary to the common believe and classical nucleation theory, interestingly,\nwe find linear strip-like nucleating clusters having significantly different\norder and average coordination number than the bulk stable phase. In the early\nstage of growth, the cluster grows as linear strip followed by branched and\nring-like strips. The geometry of growing cluster is a consequence of the\ndelicate balance between two types of interactions which enables the dominance\nof stabilizing energy over the destabilizing surface energy. The nuclei of\nstable oblique phase are wetted by intermediate order particles which minimizes\nthe surface free energy. We observe different pathways for pressure and\ntemperature induced transitions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Apr 2013 08:44:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

The estimated kinematical ages suggest that the three oldest outflows\nhave been ejected in intervals of ~ 1100 and ~ 400 yr during which, the\nejection axis has changes its orientation by ~ 60 degrees and ~ 40 degrees,\nrespectively. Although a inner ring-like structure is suggested by the direct\nimages, its kinematics shows that no equatorial ring or toroid exists in the\nnebula. At the contrary, the long-slit spectra reveal that the ring-like\nstructure corresponds to a fourth outflow that is oriented almost perpendicular\nto the other three. This fourth outflow is the youngest one and appears to be\ninteracting with the other three, creating a protruding zone that sweeps\nmaterial in a region almost perpendicular to the major axes of the oldest\noutflows. This structure also presents two bright arcuate regions along the\nsame direction of the older outflows, and at opposite sides from the central\nstar. From our model, we suggest that NGC 6058 could be anintermediate\nevolutionary stage between starfish planetary nebulae and multipolar planetary\nnebula with apparent equatorial lobes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Apr 2013 10:18:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

In this paper, we perform a comparative study of the physics reach\nof two future superbeam facilities, LBNE and LBNO in their first phases of run,\nto resolve the issues of neutrino mass hierarchy, octant of theta23, and\nleptonic CP violation. We also find that the sensitivity of these future\nfacilities can be improved significantly by adding the projected data from T2K\nand NOvA. Stand-alone LBNO setup with a 10 kt detector has a mass hierarchy\ndiscovery reach of more than 7 sigma, for the lowest allowed value of\nsin^2theta23(true) = 0.34. This result is valid for any choice of true deltaCP\nand hierarchy. LBNE10, in combination with T2K and NOvA, can achieve 3 sigma\nhierarchy discrimination for any choice of deltaCP, sin^2theta23, and\nhierarchy. The same combination can provide a 3 sigma octant resolution for\nsin^2theta23(true) leq 0.44 or for sin^2theta23(true) geq 0.58 for all values\nof deltaCP(true). LBNO can give similar results with 10 kt detector mass. In\ntheir first phases, both LBNE10 and LBNO with 20 kt detector can establish\nleptonic CP violation for around 50% values of true deltaCP at 2 sigma\nconfidence level. In case of LBNE10, CP coverage at 3 sigma can be enhanced\nfrom 3% to 43% by combining T2K and NOvA data, assuming sin^2theta23(true) =\n0.5.

From a users perspective, the most natural way to\ninteract with a computer would be through a speech and gesture interface.\nAlthough speech recognition has made significant advances in the past ten\nyears, gesture recognition has been lagging behind. Sign Languages (SL) are the\nmost accomplished forms of gestural communication. Therefore, their automatic\nanalysis is a real challenge, which is interestingly implied to their lexical\nand syntactic organization levels. Statements dealing with sign language occupy\na significant interest in the Automatic Natural Language Processing (ANLP)\ndomain. In this work, we are dealing with sign language recognition, in\nparticular of French Sign Language (FSL). FSL has its own specificities, such\nas the simultaneity of several parameters, the important role of the facial\nexpression or movement and the use of space for the proper utterance\norganization.

We use a fully general\nrelativistic description of both the radiative and hydrodynamic processes,\nwhich allows us to study the dependence on the black hole spin. The spin value\nstrongly affects the gamma-ray emissivity within ~10 gravitational radii. The\ncentral regions of flows with the total luminosities L < 0.001 of the Eddington\nluminosity are mostly transparent to photons with energies below 10 GeV,\npermitting investigation of the effects of space-time metric. For such L, an\nobservational upper limit on the gamma-ray (0.1-10 GeV) to X-ray (2-10 keV)\nluminosity ratio of L_{0.1-10 GeV}/L_{2-10 keV} << 0.1 can rule out rapid\nrotation of the black hole; on the other hand, a measurement of L_{0.1-10\nGeV}/L_{2-10 keV} ~ 0.1 cannot be regarded as the evidence of rapid rotation,\nas such a ratio can also result from a flat radial profile of gamma-ray\nemissivity (which would occur for nonthermal acceleration of protons in the\nwhole body of the flow). At L > 0.01 of the Eddington luminosity, the gamma-ray\nemission from the innermost region is strongly absorbed and the observed\ngamma-rays do not carry information on the value of the black hole spin.

In these experiments a\nwide range of dielectrics have been studied including binary transition metal\noxides, perovskite oxides, chalcogenides, carbon- and silicon-based materials,\nas well as organic materials. RS phenomena can be used to store information and\noffer an attractive performance, which encompasses fast switching speeds, high\nscalability, and the desirable compatibility with Si-based\ncomplementary-metal-oxide-semiconductor fabrication. This is promising for\nnonvolatile memory technology, i.e. resistance random access memory (RRAM).\nHowever, a comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanism is still\nlacking. This impedes a faster product development as well as an accurate\nassessment of the device performance potential. Generally speaking, RS occurs\nnot in the entire dielectric but only a small, confined region, which results\nfrom the local variation of conductivity in dielectrics. In this review, we\nfocus on the RS in oxides with such an inhomogeneous conductivity. According to\nthe origin of the conductivity inhomogeneity, the RS phenomena and their\nworking mechanism are reviewed by dividing them into two aspects: interface RS,\nbased on the change of contact resistance at metal/oxide interface due to the\nchange of Schottky barrier and interface chemical layer, and bulk RS, realized\nby the formation, connection, and disconnection of conductive channels in the\noxides. Finally the current challenges of RS investigation and the potential\nimprovement of the RS performance for the nonvolatile memories are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Apr 2013 13:30:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-05"}

Employing a sample of 42 clusters from the\nRCS-1 over the redshift range 0.3 < z < 1.0 and spanning an approximate range\nin mass of 10^{14-15} Msun, we show the number of IR-luminous galaxies in\nclusters above a fixed IR luminosity of 2x10^{11} Msun per unit cluster mass\nevolves as (1+z)^{5.1+/-1.9}. These results assume a single star forming galaxy\ntemplate; the presence of AGN, and an evolution in their relative contribution\nto the mid-IR galaxy emission, will alter the overall number counts per cluster\nand their rate of evolution. We infer the total SFR per unit cluster mass and\nfind T_SFR/M_c ~ (1+z)^{5.4+/-1.9}. This evolution can be attributed entirely\nto the change in the in-falling field galaxy population. The T_SFR/M_c (binned\nover all redshift) decreases with increasing cluster mass with a slope\n(T_SFR/M_c ~ M_c^{-1.5+/-0.4}) consistent with the dependence of the\nstellar-to-total mass per unit cluster mass seen locally.

A large amount of core angular momentum in the phases\npreceding the explosion is required to form LGRBs. A very high initial\nrotational velocity can provide this angular momentum. Such a velocity strongly\ninfluences the way the star evolves: it is chemically homogeneously mixed and\nevolves directly towards the blue part of the HR diagram from the main\nsequence. We have shown that chemically homogeneous evolution (CHE) takes place\nin the SMC, at low metallicity. We want to see if there is a metallicity\nthreshold above which such an evolution does not exist. We perform a\nspectroscopic analysis of H-rich early-type WN stars in the LMC and the Galaxy.\nWe use the code CMFGEN to determine the fundamental properties and the surface\ncomposition of the target stars. We then place the stars in the HR diagram and\ndetermine their evolution. We show that both the LMC and Galactic WNh stars we\nselected cannot be explained by standard stellar evolution. They are located on\nthe left of the main sequence but show surface abundances typical of CN\nequilibrium. In addition, they still contain a large amount of hydrogen. They\nare thus core-H burning objects. Their properties are consistent with CHE. We\ndetermine the metallicity of the Galactic stars from their position and\nGalactic metallicity gradients, and conclude that they have 0.6<Z<1.0. A\nmoderate coupling between the core and the envelope is required to explain that\nstellar winds do not extract to much angular momentum to prevent a blueward\nevolution. In view of the findings that some long gamma ray bursts appear in\nsolar environments, CHE may be a viable way to form them over a wide range of\nmetallicities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Apr 2013 15:16:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-15"}

For this the Data Encryption\nStandard is used as a proof of concept. This paper presents the design for\nHardware implementation of DES cryptanalysis on FPGA using exhaustive key\nsearch. Two architectures viz. Rolled and Unrolled DES architecture are\ncompared and based on experimental result the Rolled architecture is\nimplemented on FPGA.

The network includes energy measurement nodes\nand a central server, where the nodes read the energy use of connected\nappliance, and wirelessly report their readings to the central server for\nprocessing. The server displays the readings from these nodes via a user visual\ninterface in real time. Through this system, users can easily understand their\nelectricity usage patterns and adapt their behavior to reduce their energy\nconsumption and costs. Moreover, users are able to remotely power on/off\nindividual devices to actively control the power use of certain appliances. The\nsystem allows for inexpensive monitoring of home energy use and illustrates a\npractical way to control the energy consumption through user interaction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Apr 2013 13:34:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-07"}
