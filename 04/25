Then, we analyse different S3 models, where the flavour symmetry\nis preserved as an exact, but hidden symmetry of the low energy spectra, after\nthe electroweak symmetry breaking. The latter models require the addition of\ntwo more Higgs electroweak doublets which are accommodated in an S3 doublet.

To reach a high photometric and spectroscopic\nprecision, it is therefore essential to correct for these effects. We present\nhere a novel non-parametric approach, named Gaussian Process method for Star\nCharacterization (GPSC), to remove effects of stellar activity and instrumental\nsystematics on planetary signals, with a view to preserve the atmospheric\ncontribution which can be as small as 10$^{-4}$ or even 10$^{-5}$ the flux of\nthe star.

Consequently we considered 10 hours of\ncontinuous observations: daily, every other day and weekly, and we used the\nGPSC to reconstruct the lightcurves. When data are recorded more frequently\nthan once every five days we found that our approach is able to extrapolate the\nstellar flux at the 10$^{-4}$ level compared to the full stellar flux.

But what selects the rest frame of nucleation? This question has been\nrecently addressed in [1] in the context of Schwinger pair production in 1+1\ndimensions, by using a model detector in order to probe the nucleated pairs.\nThe analysis in [1] showed that, for a constant external electric field, the\nadiabatic \"in\" vacuum of charged particles is Lorentz invariant, and in this\ncase pairs tend to nucleate preferentially at rest with respect to the\ndetector. Here, we sharpen this picture by showing that the typical relative\nvelocity between the frame of nucleation and that of the detector is at most of\norder \\Delta v ~ S_E^{-1/3} << 1. Here, S_E >> 1 is the action of the instanton\ndescribing pair creation. The bound \\Delta v coincides with the minimum\nuncertainty in the velocity of a non-relativistic charged particle embedded in\na constant electric field. A velocity of order \\Delta v is reached after a time\ninterval of order \\Delta t ~ S_E^{-1/3} r_0 << r_0 past the turning point in\nthe semiclassical trajectory, where r_0 is the size of the instanton. If the\ninteraction takes place in the vicinity of the turning point, the semiclassical\ndescription of collision does not apply.

Also, the analytical expressions for the shift of the Dirac\npoints as well as the corresponding Dirac equation are found. In view of the\nformer results, we discuss the range of applicability of the usual approach of\nconsidering pseudomagnetic fields in a Dirac equation derived from the old\nDirac points of the unstrained lattice. Such considerations are important if a\ncomparison is desired with experiments or numerical simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Apr 2013 18:02:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Jun 2013 01:50:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 9 Sep 2013 05:55:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-10"}

However, multi-user MIMO, as originally envisioned with roughly equal\nnumbers of service-antennas and terminals and frequency division duplex\noperation, is not a scalable technology. Massive MIMO (also known as\n\"Large-Scale Antenna Systems\", \"Very Large MIMO\", \"Hyper MIMO\", \"Full-Dimension\nMIMO\" & \"ARGOS\") makes a clean break with current practice through the use of a\nlarge excess of service-antennas over active terminals and time division duplex\noperation. Extra antennas help by focusing energy into ever-smaller regions of\nspace to bring huge improvements in throughput and radiated energy efficiency.\nOther benefits of massive MIMO include the extensive use of inexpensive\nlow-power components, reduced latency, simplification of the media access\ncontrol (MAC) layer, and robustness to intentional jamming. The anticipated\nthroughput depend on the propagation environment providing asymptotically\northogonal channels to the terminals, but so far experiments have not disclosed\nany limitations in this regard. While massive MIMO renders many traditional\nresearch problems irrelevant, it uncovers entirely new problems that urgently\nneed attention: the challenge of making many low-cost low-precision components\nthat work effectively together, acquisition and synchronization for\nnewly-joined terminals, the exploitation of extra degrees of freedom provided\nby the excess of service-antennas, reducing internal power consumption to\nachieve total energy efficiency reductions, and finding new deployment\nscenarios.

That is, if Willie\nlistening to Alice's transmissions over a \"significantly noisier\" BSC than the\none to Bob, he should be unable to estimate even whether Alice is transmitting.\nWe consider two scenarios. In our first scenario, we assume that the channel\ntransition probability from Alice to Bob and Willie is perfectly known to all\nparties. Here, even when Alice's (potential) communication scheme is publicly\nknown to Willie (with no common randomness between Alice and Bob), we prove\nthat over 'n' channel uses Alice can transmit a message of length O(sqrt{n})\nbits to Bob, deniably from Willie. We also prove information-theoretic\norder-optimality of this result. In our second scenario, we allow uncertainty\nin the knowledge of the channel transition probability parameters. In\nparticular, we assume that the channel transition probabilities for both Bob\nand Willie are uniformly drawn from a known interval.

We use the Janssen-Van\nLeeuwaarden-Zwart bounds to obtain asymptotically optimal solutions to this\nproblem. The second model considered is one in which the arrival rates are not\ncompletely known in advance (before the server staffing levels are chosen), but\nrather are known via a probability distribution.

Over several viscous times (~1s), a\nfraction ~10% of the initial disk mass is ejected as a moderately neutron-rich\nwind (Y_e ~ 0.2) powered by viscous heating and nuclear recombination, with\nneutrino self-irradiation playing a sub-dominant role. Although the properties\nof the outflow vary in time and direction, their mean values in the\nheavy-element production region are relatively robust to variations in the\ninitial conditions of the disk and the magnitude of its viscosity. The outflow\nis sufficiently neutron-rich that most of the ejecta forms heavy r-process\nelements with mass number A >130, thus representing a new astrophysical source\nof r-process nucleosynthesis, distinct from that produced in the dynamical\nejecta. Due to its moderately high entropy, disk outflows contain a small\nresidual fraction ~1% of helium, which could produce a unique spectroscopic\nsignature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Apr 2013 20:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Jul 2013 17:25:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

These\nframe independent perturbations are therefore particularly useful in relating\nresults in different frames at the perturbative level. On the other hand, the\nfield perturbation and graviton on uniform curvature hypersurfaces in the\nJordan and Einstein frame are non-linearly related, as are their corresponding\nactions and $n$-point functions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Apr 2013 20:17:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

Previous studies using FIRST were designed to analyze\nthe rigidity and flexibility of proteins using a single static (snapshot)\nstructure. It is however well known that proteins can undergo spontaneous\nsub-molecular unfolding and refolding, or conformational dynamics, even under\nconditions that strongly favour a well-defined native structure. These (local)\nunfolding events result in a large number of conformers that differ from each\nother very slightly. In this context, proteins are better represented as a\nthermodynamic ensemble of `native-like' structures, and not just as a single\nstatic low-energy structure.\n  Working with this notion, we introduce a novel FIRST-based approach for\npredicting rigidity/flexibility of the protein ensemble by (i) averaging the\nhydrogen bonding strengths from the entire ensemble and (ii) by refining the\nmathematical model of hydrogen bonds. Furthermore, we combine our\nFIRST-ensemble rigidity predictions with the ensemble solvent accessibility\ndata of the backbone amides and propose a novel computational method which uses\nboth rigidity and solvent accessibility for predicting hydrogen-deuterium\nexchange (HDX). To validate our predictions, we report a novel site specific\nHDX experiment which characterizes the native structural ensemble of\nAcylphosphatase from hyperthermophile Sulfolobus solfataricus (Sso AcP).\n  The sub-structural conformational dynamics that is observed by HDX data, is\nclosely matched with the FIRST-ensemble rigidity predictions, which could not\nbe attained using the traditional single `snapshot' rigidity analysis.\nMoreover, the computational predictions of regions that are protected from HDX\nand those that undergo exchange are in very good agreement with the\nexperimental HDX profile of Sso AcP.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Apr 2013 04:05:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 26 Apr 2013 17:20:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 8 May 2013 03:28:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

Methods: Based on\nHerschel continuum data we identify a massive gas clump that remains\nfar-infrared dark up to 100mum wavelengths. The fragmentation and dynamical\nproperties are investigated by means of Plateau de Bure Interferometer and\nNobeyama 45m single-dish spectral line and continuum observations. Results: The\nmassive gas reservoir fragments at spatial scales of ~18000AU in four cores.\nComparing the spatial extent of this high-mass region with intermediate- to\nlow-mass starless cores from the literature, we find that linear sizes do not\nvary significantly over the whole mass regime. However, the high-mass regions\nsqueeze much more gas into these similar volumes and hence have orders of\nmagnitude larger densities. The fragmentation properties of the presented\nlow-to high-mass regions are consistent with gravitational instable Jeans\nfragmentation. Furthermore, we find multiple velocity components associated\nwith the resolved cores. Recent radiative transfer hydrodynamic simulations of\nthe dynamic collapse of massive gas clumps also result in multiple velocity\ncomponents along the line of sight because of the clumpy structure of the\nregions. This result is supported by a ratio between viral and total gas mass\nfor the whole region <1. Conclusions: This apparently still starless high-mass\ngas clump exhibits clear signatures of early fragmentation and dynamic collapse\nprior to the formation of an embedded heating source. A comparison with regions\nof lower mass reveals that the linear size of star-forming regions does not\nnecessarily have to vary much for different masses, however, the mass\nreservoirs and gas densities are orders of magnitude enhanced for high-mass\nregions compared to their lower-mass siblings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Apr 2013 07:14:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

The companion Kepler-76b was\nidentified by the BEER algorithm, which detected the BEaming (sometimes called\nDoppler boosting) effect together with the Ellipsoidal and Reflection/emission\nmodulations (BEER), at an orbital period of 1.54 days, suggesting a planetary\ncompanion orbiting the 13.3 mag F star. Further investigation revealed that\nthis star appeared in the Kepler eclipsing binary catalog with estimated\nprimary and secondary eclipse depths of 5e-3 and 1e-4 respectively.\nSpectroscopic radial-velocity follow-up observations with TRES and SOPHIE\nconfirmed Kepler-76b as a transiting 2.0+/-0.26 Mjup hot Jupiter. The mass of a\ntransiting planet can be estimated from either the beaming or the ellipsoidal\namplitude. The ellipsoidal-based mass estimate of Kepler-76b is consistent with\nthe spectroscopically measured mass while the beaming-based estimate is\nsignificantly inflated. We explain this apparent discrepancy as evidence for\nthe superrotation phenomenon, which involves eastward displacement of the\nhottest atmospheric spot of a tidally-locked planet by an equatorial\nsuper-rotating jet stream. This phenomenon was previously observed only for HD\n189733b in the infrared. We show that a phase shift of 10.3+/-2.0 degrees of\nthe planet reflection/emission modulation, due to superrotation, explains the\napparently inflated beaming modulation, resolving the ellipsoidal/beaming\namplitude discrepancy. Kepler-76b is one of very few confirmed planets in the\nKepler light curves that show BEER modulations and the first to show\nsuperrotation evidence in the Kepler band.

Furthermore, we show that from each graph of groups, we\nmay construct a Rees category and prove that the fundamental group of the\nformer is the universal group of the latter. In this way, Bass-Serre theory may\nbe viewed as a special case of the general problem of embedding categories into\ngroupoids.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Apr 2013 09:58:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 May 2013 10:50:10 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 13 Aug 2013 16:18:41 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 26 Aug 2013 11:02:22 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sun, 9 Nov 2014 11:58:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-11"}

Non-canonical\nHamiltonian structure of the problem, i.e., Poisson tensor, Casimir functions\nand equations of motion, are obtained through a Poisson reduction process by\nmeans of the symmetry of the problem. The linear system matrix at the relative\nequilibria is given through the multiplication of the Poisson tensor and\nHessian matrix of the variational Lagrangian. Based on the characteristic\nequation of the linear system matrix, the conditions of linear stability of the\nrelative equilibria are obtained. The conditions of nonlinear stability of the\nrelative equilibria are derived with the energy-Casimir method through the\nprojected Hessian matrix of the variational Lagrangian. With the stability\nconditions obtained, both the linear and nonlinear stability of the relative\nequilibria are investigated in details in a wide range of the parameters of the\ngravity field and the rigid body.

For the open XXZ model, we discover that the decoherence time diverges\nin the thermodynamic limit. The coherence decay is then algebraic instead of\nexponential. This is due to a vanishing gap in the spectrum of the\ncorresponding Liouville superoperator and can be explained on the basis of a\nperturbative treatment. In contrast, decoherence in the open transverse-field\nIsing model is found to be always exponential. In this case, the internal\ninteractions can both facilitate and impede the environment-induced\ndecoherence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Apr 2013 12:15:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Oct 2013 21:22:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-24"}

In recent years, the\ndevelopment of robots assisting in disaster mitigation in urban environments\nhas been actively encouraged, since robots can be deployed in dangerous and\nhazardous areas where human SAR operations would not be possible.\n  In order to meet the reliability requirements in SAR, the specifications of\nthe robots are stated in Linear Temporal Logic and synthesized into finite\nstate machines that can be executed as controllers. The resulting controllers\nare purely discrete and maintain an ongoing interaction with their environment\nby changing their internal state according to the inputs they receive from\nsensors or other robots.\n  Since SAR robots have to cooperate in order to complete the required tasks,\nthe synthesis of controllers that together achieve a common goal is considered.\nThis distributed synthesis problem is provably undecidable, hence it cannot be\nsolved in full generality, but a set of design principles is introduced in\norder to develop specialized synthesizable specifications. In particular,\ncommunication and cooperation are resolved by introducing a verified\nstandardized communication protocol and preempting negotiations between robots.\n  The robots move on a graph on which we consider the search for stationary and\nmoving targets. Searching for moving targets is cast into a game of cops and\nrobbers, and specifications implementing a winning strategy are developed so\nthat the number of robots required is minimized.\n  The viability of the methods is demonstrated by synthesizing controllers for\nrobots performing search and rescue for stationary targets and searching for\nmoving targets. It is shown that the controllers are guaranteed to achieve the\ncommon goal of finding and rescuing the targets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Apr 2013 12:49:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-26"}

Hence even in the presence of strong phase noise\nnon-classical correlations persist between the spin and path of the neutron\nbeam. This indicates that measurements performed on the spin of the neutron\nbeam will induce a disturbance on the path state. We calculate the effect of\nthe spin measurement by observing the changes in the observed contrast of the\ninterferometer for an output beam post-selected on a given spin state. In doing\nso we demonstrate that these measurements allow us to implement a quantum\neraser, and a which-way measurement of the path taken by the neutron through\nthe interferometer. While strong phase noise removes the quantum eraser, the\nspin-filtered which-way measurement is robust to phase noise. We experimentally\ndemonstrate this disturbance by comparing the contrasts of the output beam with\nand without spin measurements of three neutron interferometers with varying\nnoise strengths.
