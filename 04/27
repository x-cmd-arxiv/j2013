The model\nwith an exponentially decaying memory kernel is realized in Barkhausen\nexperiments with eddy-current relaxation, and has previously been shown\nnumerically to account for the experimentally observed asymmetry of\nBarkhausen-pulse shapes. We elucidate another qualitatively new feature: the\nbreakup of each avalanche of the standard ABBM model into a cluster of\nsub-avalanches, sharply delimited for slow relaxation under quasi-static\ndriving. These conditions are typical for earthquake dynamics. With relaxation\nand aftershock clustering, the present model includes important ingredients for\nan effective description of earthquakes.

This region is composed of four bright mid-IR bubbles and\nnumerous infrared dark clouds. Two bubbles, N 74 and N 75, each host a star\ncluster anchored by a single O9.5V star. We identified 162 young stellar\nobjects (YSOs) and classify 54 as stage I, 7 stage II, 6 stage III, and 32\nambiguous. We do not detect the classical signposts of triggered SF, i.e.,\nstar-forming pillars or YSOs embedded within bubble rims. We conclude that\nfeedback-triggered SF has not occurred in G38.9-0.4. The YSOs are\npreferentially coincident with infrared dark clouds. This leads to a strong\ncorrelation between areal YSO mass surface density and gas mass surface density\nwith a power law slope near 1.3, which closely matches the Schmidt-Kennicutt\nLaw. The correlation is similar inside and outside the bubbles and may mean\nthat the SF efficiency is neither enhanced nor supressed in regions potentially\ninfluenced by stellar feedback. This suggests that gas density, regardless of\nhow it is collected, is a more important driver of SF than stellar feedback.\nLarger studies should be able to quantify the fraction of all SF that is\nfeedback-triggered by determining the fraction SF, feedback-compressed gas\nsurrounding HII regions relative to that already present in molecular clouds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Apr 2013 18:33:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

A kinetic equation for the system with\npositive and negative vortices is derived using the Klimontovich formalism.\nSimilar to the Fokker-Planck collision term, the obtained collision term\nconsists of a diffusion term and a drift term. It is revealed that the\nmechanism for the self-organization in the 2D point vortex system at negative\nabsolute temperature is mainly provided by the drift term. Positive and\nnegative vortices are driven toward opposite directions respectively by the\ndrift term. As a result, well-known, two isolated clumps with positive and\nnegative vortices, respectively, are formed as an equilibrium distribution.\nRegardless of the number of species of the vortices, either single- or\ndouble-sign, it is found that the collision term has following physically good\nproperties: (i) When the system reaches a quasi-stationary state near the\nthermal equilibrium state with negative absolute temperature, the sign of $d\n\\omega / d \\psi$ is expected to be positive, where $\\omega$ is the vorticity\nand $\\psi$ is the stream function.

The idea of extending quantum\nfield theories to manifolds of lower dimension was first proposed by Dan Freed\nin the nineties. In the case of conformal field theory (CFT), we are talking of\nan extension of the Atiyah-Segal axioms, where one replaces the bordism\ncategory of Riemann surfaces by a suitable bordism bicategory, whose ob jects\nare points, whose morphisms are 1-manifolds, and whose 2-morphisms are pieces\nof Riemann surface. There is a beautiful classification of full (rational) CFTs\ndue to Fuchs, Runkel and Schweigert, which roughly says the following. Fix a\nchiral algebra A (= vertex algebra). Then the set of full cfts whose left and\nright chiral algebras agree with A is classified by Frobenius algebras internal\nto Rep(A). A famous example to which one can successfully apply this is the\ncase where the chiral algebra A is affine su(2) at level k, for some k in N. In\nthat case, the Frobenius algebras in Rep (A) are classified by A_n, D_n, E_6,\nE_7, E_8, and so are the corresponding CFTs. Recently, Kapustin and Saulina\ngave a conceptual interpretation of the FRS classification in terms of\n3-dimensional Chern-Simons theory with defects. Those defects are also given by\nFrobenius algebra ob ject in Rep(A). Inspired by the proposal of Kapustin and\nSaulina, we will (partially) construct the three-tier CFT associated to a\nFrobenius algebra object.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Apr 2013 05:51:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 Dec 2013 22:07:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-25"}

The\nbasic idea of this method is that the system we want to study (for example,\nsome molecular system described by molecular mechanics) is coupled to a\ncoarse-grained (CG) system, which can move more quickly and computed more\nefficiently than the original system. We simulate this combined system\n(original + CG system) using (underdamped) Langevin dynamics where different\nheat baths are coupled to the two systems. When the coupling is strong enough,\nthe original system is guided by the CG system, and able to sample the\nconfiguration and path space more efficiency. We need to correct the bias\ncaused by the coupling, however, by employing the Hamiltonian replica exchange\nwhere we prepare many path replica with different coupling strengths. As a\nresult, an unbiased path ensemble for the original system can be found in the\nweakest coupling path ensemble. This strategy is easily implemented because a\nweight for a path calculated by the OM action is formally the same as the\nBoltzmann weight if we properly define the path \"Hamiltonian\".

We ask the following question: can the information\ntransfer in both directions of a link be critical to maximizing the end-to-end\ncommunication rates in the network? Equivalently, could one of the directions\nin each bidirected link (and more generally at least one of the links forming a\ncycle) be shut down and the capacity of the network still be approximately\nmaintained?

Here we study the cellular nervous system of the nematode worm C.\nelegans, together with information on the birth times of neurons and on their\nspatial locations.

Moreover, $C > 0$ units of energy is required to make a\ntransition from the sleep state to the active state. The jobs are specified by\ntheir arrival time, deadline and the processing volume.\n  We consider a scheduling problem, called speed scaling with sleep state,\nwhere each job has to be scheduled within their arrival time and deadline, and\nthe goal is to minimize the total energy consumption required to process these\njobs.

For the\nmost part, these systems are in first-order resonances and dynamical studies\nhave focused their efforts towards understanding the origin and evolution of\nsuch dynamically resonant commensurabilities. We report here the discovery of\ntwo super-Earths that are close to a second-order dynamical resonance, orbiting\nthe metal-poor ([Fe/H]=-0.43 dex) and inactive G2V star HD41248. We analysed 62\nHARPS archival radial velocities for this star, that until now, had exhibited\nno evidence for planetary companions. Using our new Bayesian Doppler signal\ndetection algorithm, we find two significant signals in the data, with periods\nof 18.357 days and 25.648 days, indicating they could be part of a 7:5\nsecond-order mean motion resonance. Both semi-amplitudes are below 3m/s and the\nminimum masses of the pair are 12.3 and 8.6Mearth, respectively. Our\nsimulations found that apsidal alignment stabilizes the system, and even though\nlibration of the resonant angles was not seen, the system is affected by the\npresence of the resonance and could yet occupy the 7:5 commensurability, which\nwould be the first planetary configuration in such a dynamical resonance. Given\nthe multitude of low-mass multiplanet systems that will be discovered in the\ncoming years, we expect more of these second-order resonant configurations will\nemerge from the data, highlighting the need for a better understanding of the\ndynamical interactions between forming planetesimals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Apr 2013 14:19:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Apr 2013 11:17:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

An invertible\nlinear-conjugate linear (LCL) operator named the DT FREquency Shift (FRESH)\nproperizer is first proposed. It is shown that the DT FRESH properizer converts\na DT improper-complex SOCS random process input to an equivalent DT\nproper-complex SOCS random process output by utilizing the information only\nabout the cycle period of the input. An invertible LCL block processing\noperator named the asymptotic FRESH properizer is then proposed that mimics the\noperation of the DT FRESH properizer but processes a finite number of\nconsecutive samples of a DT improper-complex SOCS random process. It is shown\nthat the output of the asymptotic FRESH properizer is not proper but\nasymptotically proper and that its frequency-domain covariance matrix converges\nto a highly-structured block matrix with diagonal blocks as the block size\ntends to infinity. Two representative estimation and detection problems are\npresented to demonstrate that asymptotically optimal low-complexity\npost-processors can be easily designed by exploiting these asymptotic\nsecond-order properties of the output of the asymptotic FRESH properizer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Apr 2013 14:34:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-30"}

A\nquaternionic model of the three-parametric loop of boosts is obtained and a\nremarkable connection with geodesic loops of Lobachevskii space is found.
