We use high-quality observations from CRISP at the SST to investigate\nsigns of these different kinetic modes in spicules on the disk. Earlier, rapid\nblue-shifted excursions (RBEs), short-lived absorption features in the blue\nwing of chromospheric spectral lines, were identified as the disk counterpart\nof type II spicules. Here we report the existence of similar absorption\nfeatures in the red wing of the Ca II 8542 and Halpha lines: rapid red-shifted\nexcursions (RREs). RREs are found over the whole solar disk and are located in\nthe same regions as RBEs: in the vicinity of magnetic field concentrations.\nRREs have similar characteristics as RBEs: they have similar lengths, widths,\nlifetimes, and average Doppler velocity. The striking similarity of RREs to\nRBEs implies that RREs are a manifestation of the same physical phenomenon and\nthat spicules harbour motions that can result in a net red-shift when observed\non-disk. We find that RREs are less abundant than RBEs and we interpret the\nhigher number of RBEs and the decreased imbalance towards the limb as an\nindication that field-aligned up-flows have a significant contribution to the\nnet Dopplershift. Most RREs and RBEs are observed in isolation but we find many\nexamples of parallel and touching RRE/RBE pairs which appear to be part of the\nsame spicule. We interpret the existence of these RRE/RBE pairs as signs that\ntorsional motion is an important characteristic of spicules. The fact that most\nRBEs and RREs are observed in isolation agrees with the idea that transversal\nswaying motion is another important kinetic mode.

The first, based on previous work of Berger, is a\nfamily of polarized vacuum Gowdy spacetimes on a torus, which satisfies all of\nthe assumptions of our framework. As the parameter approaches its limiting\nvalue, the metric uniformly approaches a smooth background metric, but\nspacetime derivatives of the deviation of the metric from the background metric\ndo not converge uniformly to zero.

The required resolution is not achievable because the\nseparation between lensed images is several times larger than the deflection\nangles by member galaxies, even for the deepest data. Here we bypass this\nlimitation by incorporating a simple physical prior for member galaxies, using\ntheir observed positions and their luminosity scaled masses.

We select our sample\nfrom the 3D-HST survey, which utilizes spectroscopy from the HST WFC3 G141\nnear-IR grism and enables precise redshift measurements for our sample of SFGs.\nStructural properties are obtained from Sersic profile fits to CANDELS WFC3\nimaging. The progenitors of z=0 SFGs with stellar mass M=10^{10.5} Msun are\ntypically half as massive at z~1. This late-time stellar mass assembly is\nconsistent with recent studies that employ abundance matching techniques. The\ndescendant SFGs at z~0 have grown in half-light radius by a factor of ~1.4\nsince z~1. The half-light radius grows with stellar mass as r_e M^{0.29}. While\nmost of the stellar mass is clearly assembling at large radii, the mass surface\ndensity profiles reveal ongoing mass growth also in the central regions where\nbulges and pseudobulges are common features in present day late-type galaxies.\nSome portion of this growth in the central regions is due to star formation as\nrecent observations of H-alpha maps for SFGs at z~1 are found to be extended\nbut centrally peaked. Connecting our lookback study with galactic archeology,\nwe find the stellar mass surface density at R=8 kpc to have increased by a\nfactor of ~2 since z~1, in good agreement with measurements derived for the\nsolar neighborhood of the Milky Way.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Apr 2013 20:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Oct 2013 04:11:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

We describe\na new, simple method to correct spectroscopically derived temperatures\n(\"excitation temperatures\") of metal-poor stars based on a literature sample\nwith -3.3<[Fe/H]<-2.5. Excitation temperatures were determined from FeI line\nabundances in high-resolution optical spectra in the wavelength range of ~3700\nto ~7000A, although shorter wavelength ranges, up to 4750 to 6800A, can also be\nemployed, and compared with photometric literature temperatures. Our adjustment\nscheme increases the temperatures up to several hundred degrees for cool red\ngiants, while leaving the near-main-sequence stars mostly unchanged. Hence, it\nbrings the excitation temperatures in good agreement with photometrically\nderived values. The modified temperature also influences other stellar\nparameters, as the FeI-FeII ionization balance is simultaneously used to\ndetermine the surface gravity, while also forcing no abundance trend on the\nabsorption line strengths to obtain the microturbulent velocity. As a result of\nincreasing the temperature, the often too low gravities and too high\nmicroturbulent velocities in red giants become higher and lower, respectively.\nOur adjustment scheme thus continues to build on the advantage of deriving\ntemperatures from spectroscopy alone, independent of reddening, while at the\nsame time producing stellar chemical abundances that are more straightforwardly\ncomparable to studies based on photometrically derived temperatures.

The large apparent size\nof cluster subhalos allows us to measure the mass of 32 subhalos detected in a\nmodel-independent manner, down to the order of 10^-3 of the virial mass of the\ncluster. Weak-lensing mass measurements of these shear-selected subhalos enable\nus to investigate subhalo properties and the correlation between subhalo masses\nand galaxy luminosities for the first time. The mean distortion profiles\nstacked over subhalos show a sharply truncated feature which is well-fitted by\na Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) mass model with the truncation radius, as expected\ndue to tidal destruction by the main cluster. We also found that subhalo\nmasses, truncation radii, and mass-to-light ratios decrease toward the cluster\ncenter. The subhalo mass function, dn/dln M_sub, in the range of 2 orders of\nmagnitude in mass, is well described by a single power law or a Schechter\nfunction. Best-fit power indices of 1.09_-0.32^+0.42 for the former model and\n0.99_-0.23^+0.34 for the latter, are in remarkable agreement with slopes of\n~0.9-1.0 predicted by the cold dark matter paradigm. The tangential distortion\nsignals in the radial range of 0.02-2Mpc/h from the cluster center show a\ncomplex structure which is well described by a composition of three mass\ncomponents of subhalos, the NFW mass distribution as a smooth component of the\nmain cluster, and a lensing model from a large scale structure behind the\ncluster. Although the lensing signals are 1 order of magnitude lower than those\nfor clusters at z~0.2, the total signal-to-noise ratio, S/N=13.3, is comparable\nto, or higher, because the enormous number of background source galaxies\ncompensates for the low lensing efficiency of the low lensing efficiency of the\nnearby cluster.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Apr 2013 20:00:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 Mar 2014 06:35:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

While the\nexistence of an O(1)-approximation is not ruled out, only an\nO(sqrt(n))-approximation [Chen, Kanchi, Kanevsky '97] is known even in bounded\ndegree graphs.

The electric field causes no distortions of the LC\ndirector far away from the sphere. Electrophoresis in the nematic LC shows two\ntypes of nonlinearity in the velocity vs. field dependence. The velocity\ncomponent parallel to the applied electric field grows linearly with the field,\nbut when the field is high enough, it also shows a cubic dependence.

Our thermal evolution models predict a long-lived (~8 Gyr) field for\nEarth and similar dynamo evolution for Earth-mass exoplanets with plate\ntectonics.

In previous studies, the control of\nresistance of organic spin valves is generally achieved by the alignment of the\nmagnetization directions of the two ferromagnetic electrodes, generating\nmagnetoresistance.1 Here we employ a new knob to tune the resistance of organic\nspin valves by adding a thin ferroelectric interfacial layer between the\nferromagnetic electrode and the organic spacer. We show that the resistance can\nbe controlled by not only the spin alignment of the two ferromagnetic\nelectrodes, but also by the electric polarization of the interfacial\nferroelectric layer: the MR of the spin valve depends strongly on the history\nof the bias voltage which is correlated with the polarization of the\nferroelectric layer; the MR even changes sign when the electric polarization of\nthe ferroelectric layer is reversed. This new tunability can be understood in\nterms of the change of relative energy level alignment between ferromagnetic\nelectrode and the organic spacer caused by the electric dipole moment of the\nferroelectric layer.

Here,\nwe present a model for analyzing cross-sectional delta-15N data of subadult\nbone collagen, which incorporates newly estimated bone collagen turnover rates\nand a framework of approximate Bayesian computation. Temporal changes in human\nsubadult bone collagen turnover rates were estimated anew from data on\ntissue-level bone metabolism reported in previous studies. A model for\nreconstructing precise weaning ages was then developed and incorporating the\nestimated turnover rates. The model is presented as a new open source R\npackage, WARN (Weaning Age Reconstruction with Nitrogen isotope analysis),\nwhich computes the age at the start and end of weaning, 15N-enrichment through\nmaternal to infant tissue, and delta-15N value of collagen synthesized entirely\nfrom weaning foods with their posterior probabilities. A precise reconstruction\nof past breastfeeding and weaning practices over a wide range of time periods\nand geographic regions could make it possible to understand this unique feature\nof human life history and cultural diversity in infant feeding practices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Apr 2013 06:44:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-10"}

However, ICA is not only\nsensitive to whitening but also difficult to learn an over-complete basis.\nConsequently, ICA with soft Reconstruction cost(RICA) was presented to learn\nsparse representations with over-complete basis even on unwhitened data.\nWhereas RICA is infeasible to represent the data with nonlinear structure due\nto its intrinsic linearity. In addition, RICA is essentially an unsupervised\nmethod and can not utilize the class information. In this paper, we propose a\nkernel ICA model with reconstruction constraint (kRICA) to capture the\nnonlinear features. To bring in the class information, we further extend the\nunsupervised kRICA to a supervised one by introducing a discrimination\nconstraint, namely d-kRICA. This constraint leads to learn a structured basis\nconsisted of basis vectors from different basis subsets corresponding to\ndifferent class labels. Then each subset will sparsely represent well for its\nown class but not for the others. Furthermore, data samples belonging to the\nsame class will have similar representations, and thereby the learned sparse\nrepresentations can take more discriminative power. Experimental results\nvalidate the effectiveness of kRICA and d-kRICA for image classification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Apr 2013 08:45:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-10"}

We consider the\nthermal crossover in the region in which tricritical effects can be neglected,\ni.e. not too close to the Theta point, for a wide range of chain volume\nfractions Phi=c/c* (c* is the overlap concentration), up to Phi=30. Scaling\ncrossover functions for global properties of the solution are obtained by\nMonte-Carlo simulations of the Domb-Joyce model. They provide the input data to\ndevelop a minimal coarse-grained model with four blobs per chain. As in the\ngood-solvent case, the coarse-grained model potentials are derived at zero\ndensity, thus avoiding the inconsistencies related to the use of\nstate-dependent potentials. We find that the coarse-grained model reproduces\nthe properties of the underlying system up to some reduced density which\nincreases when lowering the temperature towards the Theta state. Close to the\nlower-temperature crossover boundary, the tetramer model is accurate at least\nup to Phi<10, while near the good-solvent regime reasonably accurate results\nare obtained up to Phi<2. The density region in which the coarse-grained model\nis predictive can be enlarged by developing coarse-grained models with more\nblobs per chain. We extend the strategy used in the good-solvent case to the\ncrossover regime. This requires a proper treatment of the length rescalings as\nbefore, but also a proper temperature redefinition as the number of blobs is\nincreased. The case n=10 is investigated. Comparison with full-monomer results\nshows that the density region in which accurate predictions can be obtained is\nsignificantly wider than that corresponding to the n=4 case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Apr 2013 10:20:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-07"}

Using the variational\nprinciple, we write down the equilibrium equation for the magnetization and\nsolve it for both phase transitions and at the tricritical point in order to\ndetermine the magnetization profile with respect to $h_{0}$, considered as an\nindependent variable in addition to the temperature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Apr 2013 10:49:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-10"}

The detector geometry and\nrequired density of instrumentation are discussed along with the requirements\nto control the various sources of background, such as solar neutrinos. In\nparticular, the suppression of spallation events induced by atmospheric muons\nposes a challenge that will need to be addressed. Assuming this background can\nbe controlled, we find that the resulting detector will be able to detect SNe\nfrom beyond 10 Mpc, delivering between 10 and 41 regular core-collapse SN\ndetections per decade. It would further allow to study more speculative\nphenomena, such as optically dark (failed) SNe, where the collapse proceeds\ndirectly to a black hole, at a detection rate similar to that of regular SNe.\nWe find that the biggest technological challenge lies in the required number of\nlarge area photo-sensors, with simultaneous strict limits on the allowed noise\nrates.

Although\nphotons have not yet been discovered in the cosmic ray flux at highest\nenergies, the capabilities of the present cosmic ray detectors make their\ndiscovery possible, according to the predictions of conventional models, within\nthe next few years. It is therefore necessary to have a reliable and well\nmaintained software for relevant simulations. The results of this paper are\nimportant for simulations of propagation of photons at energies above 10^19 eV.\nPhotons of such high energies might interact with the geomagnetic field giving\nrise to a cascade of particles even above the atmosphere. This effect is called\na \"preshower effect\". The preshower effect is important for air shower\nevolution and has to be accounted for in full Monte Carlo simulations of\npropagation of highest energy cosmic-ray photons. In this paper we compare the\ntwo most frequently used Monte Carlo codes for preshower simulations:\nPRESHOWER, used as a stand-alone program or as a part of CORSIKA, and MaGICS,\nused as a part of AIRES.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Apr 2013 12:56:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-10"}

These two types\nof queries find important applications in practice, and a plethora of solutions\nhave been proposed in past few decades. The existing solutions, however, are\noptimized for either practical or asymptotic performance, but not both. In\nparticular, the techniques with enhanced practical efficiency are mostly\nheuristic-based, and they offer unattractive worst-case guarantees in terms of\nspace and time. On the other hand, the methods that are worst-case efficient\noften entail prohibitive preprocessing or space overheads, which render them\ninapplicable for the large road networks (with millions of nodes) commonly used\nin modern map applications.\n  This paper presents {\\em Arterial Hierarchy (AH)}, an index structure that\nnarrows the gap between theory and practice in answering shortest path and\ndistance queries on road networks. On the theoretical side, we show that, under\na realistic assumption, AH answers any distance query in $\\tilde{O}(\\log \\r)$\ntime, where $\\r = d_{max}/d_{min}$, and $d_{max}$ (resp.\\ $d_{min}$) is the\nlargest (resp.\\ smallest) $L_\\infty$ distance between any two nodes in the road\nnetwork. In addition, any shortest path query can be answered in $\\tilde{O}(k +\n\\log \\r)$ time, where $k$ is the number of nodes on the shortest path. On the\npractical side, we experimentally evaluate AH on a large set of real road\nnetworks with up to twenty million nodes, and we demonstrate that (i) AH\noutperforms the state of the art in terms of query time, and (ii) its space and\npre-computation overheads are moderate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Apr 2013 13:14:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Apr 2013 13:38:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-25"}

A global optimization problem\nis formulated for optimal link selection, which is subsequently factorized into\nsub-problems that can be solved locally, and practically via approximation.

The\ncentral aim of the paper is to complement the previous result with closure\nparameters for mean-field dynamo models, and to test the hypothesis that the\ndynamo is affected by the mode of heat transport. We perform computer\nsimulations of local shearing-box models of stratified accretion disks with\napproximate treatment of radiative heat transport, which is modeled via thermal\nconduction. We study the effect of varying the (constant) thermal diffusivity,\nand apply different vertical boundary conditions. In the case of impenetrable\nvertical boundaries, we confirm the transition from mainly conductive to mainly\nconvective vertical heat transport below a critical thermal diffusivity. This\ntransition is however much less dramatic when more natural outflow boundary\nconditions are applied. Similarly, the enhancement of magnetic activity in this\ncase is less pronounced. Nevertheless, heating via turbulent dissipation\ndetermines the thermodynamic structure of accretion disks, and clearly affects\nthe properties of the related dynamo. This effect may however have been\noverestimated in previous work, and a careful study of the role played by\nboundaries will be required.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Apr 2013 13:44:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

These are invoked to explain\nthe intriguing absence of magnetic order in CuNCN down to 4 K. We show that the\nquasiparticle spectrum of the RVB model of the proposed Hamiltonian has three\nprincipal regimes: (i) one with two pairs of lines of nodes, (ii) one with a\npair of lines of nodes (termed as 1D- and Q1D-RVB states), (iii) and one with\ntwo pseudogaps and four nodal points (2D-RVB). We present a complete\nparameters-temperature phase diagram of the model constructed with use of the\nhigh-temperature expansion of the free energy. The phase diagram thus obtained\ncontains eight different phases whose magnetic behavior includes Curie and\nPauli paramagnetism (respectively, in disordered and 1D- or Q1D-RVB phases),\nand gapped (quasi-Arrhenius) paramagnetism (2D-RVB phases). Adding\nmagnetostriction and elastic terms to the free energy we derive possible\nstructural manifestations of transitions between RVB phases. Assuming a\nsequence of transitions between RVB phases to occur in CuNCN while temperature\ndecreases explains the features observed in the temperature runs of the\nmagnetic susceptibility and lattice constants. Confronting these with the\nmagnetic susceptibility and structure data measured as functions of temperature\nin the range between ca. 20 and 200 K we show a remarkably good agreement\nbetween our theoretical predictions and the experiment as reached by ascribing\nthe model parameters values which are intuitively acceptable both in terms of\ntheir absolute and relative magnitudes and of the character of their geometry\ndependence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Apr 2013 13:59:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-10"}

Previous modelling of white-light\npolarimetric data considered the partial self-eclipse of an extended\ninhomogeneous emitting region. Alternatively, phase-dependent absorption has\nbeen used to reproduce the X-ray data. This paper presents new optical\npolarimetric data of CP Tuc and a model that consistently explains its optical\nand X-ray data. The model was based on an extension of the CYCLOPS code that\nadded X-ray bremsstrahlung emission and pre-shock region absorption to the\noriginal version, which only accounted for cyclotron emission. The new code\ncreates the possibility of simultaneous optical and X-ray fitting. We show that\nself-eclipse and absorption data have distinct signatures on the X-ray spectra.\nAlthough we were able to reasonably fit the CP Tuc optical data to cases of\nabsorption and self-eclipse, we were only able to reproduce the X-ray orbital\nmodulation after considering the absorption in the pre-shock region.\nSpecifically, we were unable to reproduce the X-ray observations in the\nself-eclipse case. We found that the primary emitting region in CP Tuc is\nlocated near the rotation pole that approximately points to the observer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Apr 2013 14:22:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

The plan is then to\nsolve the related PDE using techniques involved in their native field and\nlastly bringing back the solution in the proper statistical mechanics\nframework. Within this strand, after a streamlined test-case on the Curie-Weiss\nmodel to highlight the methods more than the physics behind, we solve the SK\nboth at the replica symmetric and at the 1-RSB level, obtaining the correct\nexpression for the free energy via an analogy to a Fourier equation and for the\nself-consistencies with an analogy to a Burger equation, whose shock wave\ndevelops exactly at critical noise level (triggering the phase transition).

Here, we develop a theoretical\nframework for analyzing the full spatio-temporal structure of one class of\ndissipative solution (snaking soliton) of the CCQGLE using the variational\napproximation technique and the dynamical systems theory. The qualitative\nbehavior of the snaking soliton is investigated using the numerical simulations\nof (a) the full nonlinear complex partial differential equation and (b) a\nsystem of three ordinary differential equations resulting from the variational\napproximation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Apr 2013 21:57:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-01"}
