These associations are often made via network flow algorithms.\nHowever, it is often the case that many candidate association solutions (the\noutput of network flow algorithms) have nearly optimal scores; in this case,\nthe optimal assignment solution is of dubious quality. Algorithms for reliably\ncomputing the uncertainty of candidate association solutions are\nunder-developed in situations where many particles are tracked over multiple\nframes of data. This is due in part to the fact that exact uncertainty\nquantification (UQ) in large association problems is computationally\nintractable because the exact computation exhibits exponential dependence on\nthe number of particles tracked. We introduce a technique that can accurately\nand efficiently quantify association ambiguity (i.e., UQ for discrete\nassociation problems) without requiring the evaluation of the cost of each\nfeasible association solution. Our method can readily be wrapped around\nexisting tracking algorithms and can efficiently handle a variety of 2D\nassociation problems. The applications presented are focused on tracking\nmolecules in live cells. Our method is validated via both simulations and\nexperiments. The experimental applications aim to accurately form tracks and\nquantify diffusion of quantum dot labeled proteins from \\emph{in vivo}\nmeasurements; here association problems involving cost matrices possessing\nhundreds to thousands of rows/columns are encountered. For such large-scale\nproblems, we discuss how our approach can efficiently and accurately quantify\ninherent uncertainty in candidate data associations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Apr 2013 16:04:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-23"}

In this paper, we want to prove how much\nwe can develop a similar theory in the latter situation, imitating the theory\nin the former one. We first prove that the weight function is constant on each\nshell for tight relative t-designs on p shells on a wide class of Q-polynomial\nassociation schemes, including Hamming association schemes. In the theory of\nEuclidean t-designs on 2 concentric spheres (shells), it is known that the\nstructure of coherent configurations is naturally attached. However, it seems\ndifficult to prove this claim in a general context. In the case of tight\n2-designs in combinatorial 2-designs, there are great many tight 2-designs,\ni.e., symmetric 2-designs, while there are very few tight 2e-designs for e no\nless than 2. So, as a starting point, we concentrate our study to the existence\nproblem of tight relative 2-designs, in particular on 2 shells, in binary\nHamming association schemes H(n,2). We prove that every tight relative\n2-designs on 2 shells in H(n,2) has the structure of coherent configuration. We\ndetermined all the possible parameters of coherent configurations attached to\nsuch tight relative 2-designs for n at most 30. Moreover for each of them we\ndetermined whether there exists such a tight relative 2-design or not, either\nby constructing them from symmetric 2-designs or Hadamard matrices, or\ntheoretically showing the non-existence. In particular, we show that for n\ncongruent to 6 (mod 8), there exist such tight relative 2-designs whose weight\nfunctions are not constant. These are the first examples of those with\nnon-constant weight.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Apr 2013 16:11:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-23"}

The construction is based on creating partitions of {1,..,d} into k\ndisjoint subsets and is probabilistic, hence our result holds with high\nprobability. Secondly we extend our results to also handle the more general\ncase where (i_1,...,i_k) can change over time and derive regret bounds for the\nsame.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Apr 2013 20:03:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 Jun 2013 14:00:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 23 Sep 2013 17:30:26 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 22 Aug 2014 14:59:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-25"}

Markovianity\nimplies a nonlinear magnetospheric system in which state changes occur\nstochastically, corresponding to transitions between local minima in an\neffective potential. State durations (though not transition times) are thus\nlargely decoupled from the characteristic time scales of various magnetospheric\nprocesses. Dyadic states are common but some objects show at least four states\nwith some transitions forbidden. Another case is the long-term intermittent\npulsar B1931+24 that has binary radio-emission and torque states with wide, but\nnon-monotonic duration distributions. It also shows a quasi-period of $38\\pm5$\ndays in a 13-yr time sequence, suggesting stochastic resonance in a Markov\nsystem with a forcing function that could be strictly periodic or\nquasi-periodic.

We also derive\nupper limits on the density of the ambient medium that decelerates the\nexplosion ejecta. We find that the density in many cases is smaller than\nexpected for stellar winds from normal Wolf-Rayet progenitors. The burst\nprogenitors may be peculiar massive stars with weaker winds or there might\nexist a mechanism that reduces the stellar wind a few years before the\nexplosion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Apr 2013 00:20:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 3 Jan 2014 22:27:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

In this paper, we propose a group-based\ncooperative Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol called GC-MAC, which addresses\nthe tradeoff between sensing accuracy and efficiency.

We derive a differential equation governing this evolution and show,\nfor given assumptions about growth and invasion, that there is a unique\ndistribution which does not vary with time. Further, we show that any initial\ndistribution converges to this stationary distribution exponentially quickly.\nIt is therefore reasonable to assume that the stationary distribution is equal\nto the true DCIS size distribution, at least for human populations which are\nrelatively stable with respect to the determinants of breast cancer.

However,\nsuch age spreads do not exist in younger clusters (i.e., 40-300 Myr), which\nchallenges this interpretation. The effects of rotation on the MSTOs of star\nclusters have been studied in previous works, but the results obtained are\nconflicting. Compared with previous works, we consider the effects of rotation\non the MS lifetime of stars. Our calculations show that rotating models have a\nfainter and redder MSTO with respect to non-rotating counterparts with ages\nbetween about 0.8 and 2.2 Gyr, but have a brighter and bluer MSTO when age is\nlarger than 2.4 Gyr. The spread of the MSTO caused by a typical rotation rate\nis equivalent to the effect of an age spread of about 200 Myr. Rotation could\nlead to the double or extended MSTOs in the CMD of the star clusters with ages\nbetween about 0.8 and 2.2 Gyr. However, the extension is not significant; and\nit does not even exist in younger clusters. If the efficiency of the mixing\nwere high enough, the effects of the mixing would counteract the effect of the\ncentrifugal support in the late stage of evolution; and the rotationally\ninduced extension would disappear in the old intermediate-age star clusters;\nbut younger clusters would have an extended MSTO. Moreover, the effects of\nrotation might aid in understanding the formation of some \"multiple\npopulations\" in globular clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Apr 2013 08:28:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 22 Aug 2013 01:34:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

Thanks\nto recent developments in digital acquisition techniques, powerful image\nanalysis algorithms are developed which can be useful non-invasive tools to\nassist in the restoration and preservation of art. In this paper we propose a\nsemi-supervised crack detection method that can be used for high-dimensional\nacquisitions of paintings coming from different modalities. Our dataset\nconsists of a recently acquired collection of images of the Ghent Altarpiece\n(1432), one of Northern Europe's most important art masterpieces. Our goal is\nto build a classifier that is able to discern crack pixels from the background\nconsisting of non-crack pixels, making optimal use of the information that is\nprovided by each modality. To accomplish this we employ a recently developed\nnon-parametric Bayesian classifier, that uses tensor factorizations to\ncharacterize any conditional probability. A prior is placed on the parameters\nof the factorization such that every possible interaction between predictors is\nallowed while still identifying a sparse subset among these predictors. The\nproposed Bayesian classifier, which we will refer to as conditional Bayesian\ntensor factorization or CBTF, is assessed by visually comparing classification\nresults with the Random Forest (RF) algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Apr 2013 09:46:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Apr 2013 09:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-24"}

Indeed, they allow us to\nmodel the human reasoning in replacing words, assessments, preferences,\nchoices, wishes... by ad hoc variables, such as fuzzy sets or more\nsophisticated variables.\n  This paper focuses on a particular model: Herrera & Martinez' 2-tuple\nlinguistic model and their approach to deal with unbalanced linguistic term\nsets. It is interesting since the computations are accomplished without loss of\ninformation while the results of the decision-making processes always refer to\nthe initial linguistic term set. They propose a fuzzy partition which\ndistributes data on the axis by using linguistic hierarchies to manage the\nnon-uniformity. However, the required input (especially the density around the\nterms) taken by their fuzzy partition algorithm may be considered as too much\ndemanding in a real-world application, since density is not always easy to\ndetermine. Moreover, in some limit cases (especially when two terms are very\nclosed semantically to each other), the partition doesn't comply with the data\nthemselves, it isn't close to the reality. Therefore we propose to modify the\nrequired input, in order to offer a simpler and more faithful partition. We\nhave added an extension to the package jFuzzyLogic and to the corresponding\nscript language FCL. This extension supports both 2-tuple models: Herrera &\nMartinez' and ours. In addition to the partition algorithm, we present two\naggregation algorithms: the arithmetic means and the addition. We also discuss\nthese kinds of 2-tuple models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Apr 2013 09:54:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-23"}

Aquaporins\nare membrane channels for water and small non-ionic solutes found in animals,\nplants, and microbes. The structures of aquaporins have high homology and\nconsist of homotetramers, each monomer of which has one pore for a water\nchannel. Each pore has two narrow portions: one is the narrowest constriction\nregion consisting of aromatic residues and an arginine (ar/R), and another is\ntwo asparagine-proline-alanine (NPA) homolog portions. Here we show that an\ninter-subunit hydrophobic interaction in AQP0 drives a stick portion consisting\nof four amino acids toward the pore and the tip of the stick portion,\nconsisting of a nitrogen atom, opens the pore: that movement is the swing\nmechanism (this http URL).

The swing\nmechanism in which inter-subunit hydrophobic interactions in the tetramer drive\nthe on-off switching of the pore explains why aquaporins consist of tetramers.\nHere, we report that experimental and molecular dynamics findings using various\nmutants support this view of the swing mechanism.

A first\nconclusion is that towards hot cores/corinos atomic oxygen easily degrades\nunsaturated hydrocarbons directly to CO or to its precursor species (such as\nHCCO or HCO) and destroys the double or triple bond of alkenes and alkynes.\nTherefore, environments rich in atomic oxygen at a relatively high temperature\nare not expected to be rich in large unsaturated hydrocarbons or polycyclic\naromatic hydrocarbons.

As in earlier considerations, we assume that the main bulk of\nthe unquenching corrections to the gluon propagator originates from the fully\ndressed quark-loop diagram. The nonperturbative evaluation of this diagram\nprovides the key relation that expresses the unquenched gluon propagator as a\ndeviation from its quenched counterpart. This relation is subsequently coupled\nto the integral equation that controls the momentum evolution of the effective\ngluon mass, which contains a single adjustable parameter; this constitutes a\nmajor improvement compared to the analysis presented in Phys. Rev. D86 (2012)\n014032, where the behaviour of the gluon propagator in the deep infrared was\nestimated through numerical extrapolation. The resulting nonlinear system is\nthen treated numerically, yielding unique solutions for the modified gluon mass\nand the quenched gluon propagator, which fully confirm the picture put forth\nrecently in several continuum and lattice studies. In particular, an infrared\nfinite gluon propagator emerges, whose saturation point is considerably\nsuppressed, due to a corresponding increase in the value of the gluon mass.\nThis characteristic feature becomes more pronounced as the number of active\nquark families increases, and can be deduced from the infrared structure of the\nkernel entering in the gluon mass equation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Apr 2013 13:09:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Oct 2013 10:08:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-17"}

The statistical sum of a such plat is related\nhere to the partition function of a two-component anyon gas.

It uses a bit Poincar\\'e's index formula\n(1881/85).

(The same ubiquity of the method is\nconjectured in all degrees, and then suspected to offer new insights.) More\nfactually, a very simple and robust phenomenon of total reality on $M$-curves\nof even order is described (the odd-order case being already settled in Gabard\n2013), and it is speculated that this could be used as an attack upon the\n(still open) Ragsdale conjecture for $M$-curves (positing that $| \\chi|\\le\nk^2$). Of course a giant gap still remains to be bridged in case the latter\nconjecture is true at all. Alas, the writer has little experimental evidence\nfor the truth of the conjecture, and the game can be a hazardous one.

Both $^{3}$He and $^{6}$Li are used commonly for thermal neutron\ndetection because of their high neutron capture absorption coefficient. By\nusing a neutron source $^{252}$Cf and a paraffin moderator in an alignment\nsystem, we can get a small beam of thermal neutrons. A flash ADC is used to\nmeasure the thermal neutron spectrum of each detector, and the detected number\nof events is determined from the spectrum, then we can calculate the detection\nefficiency of different detectors.

An important application of WSNs is in the field of real-time\ncommunication. Real-time communication is a critical service which requires a\nqualitative routing protocol for energy-efficient network communication. The\njudicious use of energy of the network nodes is essential and important for\nsustainability and longevity of a WSN. This paper proposes an algorithm namely\nPriority-Energy Based Data Forwarding Algorithm(PEDF) which empowers the node\nto choose the most suitable packet forwarding path, based on the priority of\nthe packet and the current energy status of the forwarding node. The algorithm\nhence dynamically adapts to the prevailing energy-scenario of the network and\ntakes routing decisions accordingly, based on packet priority. Minimizing\ndelay, minimizing energy utilization, maximizing throughput and maximizing\nnetwork lifetime are the key elements of the proposed algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Apr 2013 09:01:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-13"}

Under such a unified framework, we pay special\nattention to the most important awareness issues in wireless sensor networks:\nnamely dynamic awareness, energy awareness and spatiotemporal awareness. First,\nwe propose the spatiotemporal aware routing protocol for wireless sensor\nnetworks, which maintains a constant delivery speed for soft real-time\ncommunication. Second, we introduce the time-energy aware aggregation scheme,\nwhich increases the degree of aggregation and reduces energy consumption\nwithout jeopardizing the end-to-end delay. It is the data aggregation scheme to\ntake the timely delivery of messages as well as protocol overhead into account\nto adjust aggregation strategies adaptively in accordance with assessed traffic\nconditions and expected wireless sensor network requirements. Third, we also\ndeal with dynamic awareness by proposing a new communication category based on\na lazy-binding concept. The evaluation of this integrated architecture\ndemonstrates its performance composability and its capability to be tailored\nfor applications with different awareness requirements. We believe that the\nintegrated architecture, supporting various kinds of awareness requirements,\nlays a foundation for overall wireless sensor network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Apr 2013 10:00:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-13"}
