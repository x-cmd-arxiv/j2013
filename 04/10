We\npresent a systematic analysis of all X-ray sources found in the 41 nova\nmonitoring observations, along with 23 M 31 central field HRC-I observations\navailable from the Chandra data archive starting in December 1999. Based on\nthese observations, we studied the X-ray long-term variability of the source\npopulation and especially of X-ray binaries in M 31. We created a catalogue of\nsources, detected in the 64 available observations, which add up to a total\nexposure of about 1 Ms. We present a point-source catalogue, containing 318\nX-ray sources with detailed long-term variability information, 28 of which are\npublished for the first time. The spatial and temporal resolution of the\ncatalogue allows us to classify 115 X-ray binary candidates showing high X-ray\nvariability or even outbursts in addition to 14 globular cluster X-ray binary\ncandidates showing no significant variability. The analysis may suggest, that\noutburst sources are less frequent in globular clusters than in the field of M\n31. We detected 7 supernova remnants, one of which is a new candidate and in\naddition resolved the first X-rays from a known radio supernova remnant.\nBesides 33 known optical nova/X-ray source correlations, we also discovered one\npreviously unknown super-soft X-ray outburst and several new nova candidates.\nThe catalogue contains a large sample of detailed long-term X-ray light curves\nin the M 31 central field, which helps to understand the X-ray population of\nour neighbouring spiral galaxy M 31.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Apr 2013 16:11:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

It is shown that for\nthe Skyrme forces considered, the tensor effects are sizeable, and tend to\nincrease the spin instability which appears at smaller densities than in the\ncase that the tensor is not taken into account. On the contrary, the tensor\ncontribution of finite range forces to the spin susceptibility is small or\nnegligible for both isospin channels of symmetric nuclear matter as well as for\nneutron matter. A comparison with the spin susceptibility provided by realistic\ninteractions is also presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Apr 2013 16:50:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

With the help of heatmaps,\nwe can visualize the profile of a particular conference or journal over the\nbase map. Similarly, heatmap profiles can be made of individual researchers or\ngroups such as a department. The visualization system also makes it possible to\nchange the data used to generate the base map. For example, a specific journal\nor conference can be used to generate the base map and then the heatmap\noverlays can be used to show the evolution of research topics in the field over\nthe years. As before, individual researchers or research groups profiles can be\nvisualized using heatmap overlays but this time over the journal or conference\nbase map. Finally, research papers or abstracts easily generate visual\nabstracts giving a visual representation of the distribution of topics in the\npaper.

The\nstellar magnetosphere corotates with the star, forming a centrifugal barrier at\nthe disc-magnetosphere boundary which inhibits matter accretion onto the star.\nInstead, the disc matter accumulates at the disc-magnetosphere interface and\nslowly diffuses into the inner magnetosphere where it picks up angular momentum\nand is quickly ejected from the system as an outflow. Due to the interaction of\nthe matter with the magnetosphere, this wind is discontinuous and is launched\nas discrete plasmoids. If the ejection rate is lower than the disc accretion\nrate, the matter accumulates at the disc-magnetosphere boundary faster than it\ncan be ejected. In this case, accretion onto the star proceeds through the\nepisodic accretion instability in which episodes of matter accumulation are\nfollowed by simultaneous accretion and ejection. During the accretion phase of\nthis instability in which matter flows onto the star in funnel streams, we\nobserve a corresponding rise in the outflow rate. Both the accretion and\nejection processes observed in our simulations are highly non-stationary. The\nstars undergo strong spin-down due to the coupling of the stellar field with\nthe disc and corona and we measure the spin-down timescales of around 1 Myr for\na typical CTTS in the propeller regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Apr 2013 19:29:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

Our method and setting differs from many\nstochastic optimization approaches in two principal ways. Firstly, we assume\nthat the value of the function itself can be computed without noise, in other\nwords, that the function is deterministic. Secondly, we use random models of\nhigher quality than those produced by usual stochastic gradient methods. In\nparticular, a first order model based on random approximation of the gradient\nis required to provide sufficient quality of approximation with probability\ngreater than or equal to 1/2. This is in contrast with stochastic gradient\napproaches, where the model is assumed to be \"correct\" only in expectation. As\na result of this particular setting, we are able to prove convergence, with\nprobability one, of a trust-region method which is almost identical to the\nclassical method. Hence we show that a standard optimization framework can be\nused in cases when models are random and may or may not provide good\napproximations, as long as \"good\" models are more likely than \"bad\" models. Our\nresults are based on the use of properties of martingales. Our motivation comes\nfrom using random sample sets and interpolation models in derivative-free\noptimization.

Like Lax-Wendroff methods, multiderivative\nintegrators permit the evaluation of higher derivatives of the unknown in order\nto decrease the memory footprint and communication overhead. Like traditional\nRunge-Kutta methods, multiderivative integrators admit the addition of extra\nstages, which introduce extra degrees of freedom that can be used to increase\nthe order of accuracy or modify the region of absolute stability. We describe a\ngeneral framework for how these methods can be applied to two separate spatial\ndiscretizations: the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method and the finite\ndifference essentially non-oscillatory (FD-WENO) method. The two proposed\nimplementations are substantially different: for DG we leverage techniques that\nare closely related to generalized Riemann solvers; for FD-WENO we construct\nhigher spatial derivatives with central differences. Among multiderivative time\nintegrators, we argue that multistage two-derivative methods have the greatest\npotential for multidimensional applications, because they only require the flux\nfunction and its Jacobian, which is readily available.

Instead, sex is\nwidespread and it is clonal species that face early obsolescence. One possible\nreason is that sex is an adaptation to resist ubiquitous parasites, which\nevolve rapidly and potentially antagonistically. We use a heuristic approach to\nmodel mutation-selection in finite populations where a parasitic haploid mounts\na negative frequency-dependent attack on a diploid host. The host evolves\nreflexively to reduce parasitic load. Both host and parasite populations\ngenerate novel alleles by mutation and have access to large allele spaces. Sex\noutcompetes cloning by two overlapping mechanisms. First, sexual diploids adopt\nadvantageous homozygous mutations more rapidly than clonal diploids under\nconditions of lag load. This rate advantage can offset the lesser fecundity of\nsex. Second, a relative advantage to sex emerges under host mutation rates that\nare fast enough to retain fitness in a rapidly mutating parasite environment\nand increase host polymorphism. Clonal polymorphic populations\ndisproportionately experience interference with selection at high mutation\nrates, both between and within loci. This slows clonal population adaptation to\na changing parasite environment and reduces clonal population fitness relative\nto sex. The interference increases markedly with the number of loci under\nindependent selection. Rates of parasite mutation exist that not only allow sex\nto survive despite the two-fold cost of males but which enable sexual and\nclonal populations to have equal fitness and co-exist. Since all higher\norganisms carry parasitic loads, the model is of general applicability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Apr 2013 01:23:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Apr 2013 04:53:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-24"}

The\nelementary five-fold Cu2+ unit features an hourglass structure of two\ncorner-sharing scalene triangles related by inversion symmetry. Our microscopic\nHeisenberg model comprises one ferromagnetic and two antiferromagnetic exchange\ncouplings in each triangle, stabilizing a single spin S=1/2 doublet ground\nstate (GS), with an exactly vanishing zero-field splitting (by Kramer's\ntheorem), and a very large excitation gap of \\Delta~68 K. Thus, Cu5-NIPA is a\ngood candidate for achieving long electronic spin relaxation (T1) and coherence\n(T2) times at low temperatures, in analogy to other nanomagnets with low-spin\nGS's. Of particular interest is the strongly inhomogeneous distribution of the\nGS magnetic moment over the five Cu2+ spins. This is a purely\nquantum-mechanical effect since, despite the non-frustrated nature of the\nmagnetic couplings, the GS is far from the classical collinear ferrimagnetic\nconfiguration. Finally, Cu5-NIPA is a rare example of a S=1/2 nanomagnet\nshowing an enhancement in the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate 1/T1 at\nintermediate temperatures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Apr 2013 01:51:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-15"}

We perform a Bayesian\ncomparison of over 20 deterministic and stochastic models on 6304 QSO light\ncurves in SDSS Stripe 82. We include the damped random walk (or\nOrnstein-Uhlenbeck [OU] process), a particular type of stochastic model which\nrecent studies have focused on. Further models we consider are single and\ndouble sinusoids, multiple OU processes, higher order continuous autoregressive\nprocesses, and composite models. We find that only 29 out of 6304 QSO\nlightcurves are described significantly better by a deterministic model than a\nstochastic one. The OU process is an adequate description of the vast majority\nof cases (6023). Indeed, the OU process is the best single model for 3462 light\ncurves, with the composite OU process/sinusoid model being the best in 1706\ncases. The latter model is the dominant one for brighter/bluer QSOs.\nFurthermore, a non-negligible fraction of QSO lightcurves show evidence that\nnot only the mean is stochastic but the variance is stochastic, too. Our\nresults confirm earlier work that QSO light curves can be described with a\nstochastic model, but place this on a firmer footing, and further show that the\nOU process is preferred over several other stochastic and deterministic models.\nOf course, there may well exist yet better (deterministic or stochastic) models\nwhich have not been considered here.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Apr 2013 07:30:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

In the case with about $13\\%$ of the total masked area,\nthe fraction of peaks with SNR $\\nu\\ge 3$ is $\\sim 11\\%$ in comparison with\n$\\sim 7\\%$ of the mask-free case in our considered cosmological model.

The presence of a\nlarge-scale under-density in the local universe could introduce significant\nbiases into the interpretation of cosmological observables, and, in particular,\ninto the inferred effects of dark energy on the expansion rate. Here we measure\nthe K-band luminosity density as a function of redshift to test for such a\nlocal under-density. In this effort, we combine photometry from UKIDSS and\n2MASS with redshifts from the SDSS, 2DFGRS, 6DFGRS, 2MR, and GAMA surveys. We\nfind that the overall shape of the z=0 rest-frame K-band luminosity function\n(M* = -22.15 +/- 0.04 and alpha = -1.02 +/- 0.03) appears to be relatively\nconstant as a function of environment and redshift out to z ~0.2. We find a\nlocal (z < 0.07) luminosity density that is in good agreement with previous\nstudies. Beyond z ~ 0.07 we detect a rising luminosity density that reaches a\nvalue ~1.5 times higher than that measured locally at z>0.1. This suggests that\nthe stellar mass density as a function of redshift follows a similar trend.\nAssuming that luminous matter traces the underlying dark matter distribution,\nthis implies that the local mass density of the universe may be lower than the\nglobal value on a scale and amplitude sufficient to introduce significant\nbiases into the determination of basic cosmological observables, such as the\nexpansion rate. An under-density of roughly this scale and amplitude would be\nsufficient to resolve the apparent tension between direct measurements of the\nHubble constant and those inferred by Planck.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Apr 2013 09:22:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 28 Apr 2013 10:10:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 30 Apr 2013 01:19:19 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 9 Jul 2013 08:20:18 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 6 Aug 2013 06:52:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-09"}

The high\nsensitivity and spectral resolution of the Herschel/HIFI instrument provide a\nunique opportunity to observe the fundamental 1_{1,1}-0_{0,0} transition of\northo-D2O at 607 GHz and the higher energy 2_{1,2}-1_{0,1} transition of\npara-D2O at 898 GHz, both of which are inaccessible from the ground. Methods:\nThe ortho-D2O transition at 607 GHz was previously detected. We present in this\npaper the first tentative detection for the para-D2O transition at 898 GHz. The\nspherical Monte Carlo radiative transfer code RATRAN was used to reproduce the\nobserved line profiles of D2O with the same method that was used to reproduce\nthe HDO and H2-18O line profiles in IRAS 16293-2422. Results: As for HDO, the\nabsorption component seen on the D2O lines can only be reproduced by adding an\nexternal absorbing layer, possibly created by the photodesorption of the ices\nat the edges of the molecular cloud. The D2O column density is found to be\nabout 2.5e12 cm^{-2} in this added layer, leading to a D2O/H2O ratio of about\n0.5%. At a 3 sigma uncertainty, upper limits of 0.03% and 0.2% are obtained for\nthis ratio in the hot corino and the colder envelope of IRAS 16293-2422,\nrespectively. Conclusions: The deuterium fractionation derived in our study\nsuggests that the ices present in IRAS 16293-2422 formed on warm dust grains\n(~15-20 K) in dense (~1e4-5e4 cm^{-3}) translucent clouds.

The z<2 decrease is due to the slow evolution of the gas fraction in\ndiscs, modulated by the gas accretion history and regulated by the Schmidt law.\nThe Milky Way makes no exception to this behaviour.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Apr 2013 12:46:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

Protostellar envelopes are usually seen as narrow absorptions or\nemissions in the H2O 1113 and 1669 GHz ground-state lines, the H2O 987 GHz\nexcited-state line, and the H2O-18 1102 GHz ground-state line. Broader features\ndue to outflows are usually seen in absorption in the H2O 1113 and 1669 GHz\nlines, in 987 GHz emission, and not seen in H2O-18, indicating a low column\ndensity and a high excitation temperature. The H2O 1113 and 1669 GHz spectra\nshow narrow absorptions by foreground clouds along the line of sight, which\nhave a low column density and a low excitation temperature, although their H2O\northo/para ratios are close to 3.\n  The intensities of the H2O 1113 and 1669 GHz lines do not show significant\ntrends with luminosity, mass, or age. In contrast, the 987 GHz line flux\nincreases with luminosity and the H2O-18 line flux decreases with mass.\nFurthermore, appearance of the envelope in absorption in the 987 GHz and H2O-18\nlines seems to be a sign of an early evolutionary stage.\n  We conclude that the ground state transitions of H2O trace the outer parts of\nthe envelopes, so that the effects of star formation are mostly noticeable in\nthe outflow wings. These lines are heavily affected by absorption, so that line\nratios of H2O involving the ground states must be treated with caution. The\naverage H2O abundance in high-mass protostellar envelopes does not change much\nwith time. The 987 GHz line appears to be a good tracer of the mean weighted\ndust temperature of the source, which may explain why it is readily seen in\ndistant galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Apr 2013 13:23:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

Here, we utilize multiple scattering in a random photonic\nstructure to build a compact on-chip spectrometer. The probe signal diffuses\nthrough a scattering medium generating wavelength-dependent speckle patterns\nwhich can be used to recover the input spectrum after calibration. Multiple\nscattering increases the optical pathlength by folding the paths in a confined\ngeometry, enhancing the spectral decorrelation of speckle patterns and thus\nincreasing the spectral resolution.

These possibilities\nimply differences not only in the spectral energy distribution (SED) but also\nin the variability signatures, especially in the X- and $\\gamma$-ray regime.\nThus, the temporal behavior of each leptohadronic scenario can be used to probe\nthe particle population responsible for the high-energy emission as it can give\nextra information not available by spectral fits. In the present work we apply\nthese ideas to the non-thermal emission of Mrk 421. We focus on the\nobservations of March 2001, since during that period Mrk 421 showed multiple\nflares that have been observed in detail both in X-rays and $\\gamma$-rays.\nFirst, we obtain pre-flaring fits to the SED using the different types of\nleptohadronic scenarios. Then, we introduce random-walk type, small-amplitude\nvariations on the injection compactness or on the maximum energy of radiating\nparticles and follow the subsequent response of the radiated photon spectrum.\nFor each leptohadronic scenario, we calculate the X-ray and $\\gamma$-ray fluxes\nand investigate their possible correlation. Whenever the `input' variations\nlead, apart from flux variability, also to spectral variability, we present the\nresulting relations between the spectral index and the flux, both in X-rays and\n$\\gamma$-rays. We find that proton synchrotron models are favoured\nenergetically but require fine tuning between electron and proton parameters to\nreproduce the observed quadratic behaviour between X-rays and TeV\n$\\gamma-$rays. On the other hand, models based on pion-decay can reproduce this\nbehaviour in a much more natural way.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Apr 2013 13:44:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

Perhaps not surprisingly, trend filtering estimates appear to\nhave the structure of $k$th degree spline functions, with adaptively chosen\nknot points (we say ``appear'' here as trend filtering estimates are not really\nfunctions over continuous domains, and are only defined over the discrete set\nof inputs). This brings to mind comparisons to other nonparametric regression\ntools that also produce adaptive splines; in particular, we compare trend\nfiltering to smoothing splines, which penalize the sum of squared derivatives\nacross input points, and to locally adaptive regression splines [Ann. Statist.\n25 (1997) 387-413], which penalize the total variation of the $k$th derivative.\nEmpirically, we discover that trend filtering estimates adapt to the local\nlevel of smoothness much better than smoothing splines, and further, they\nexhibit a remarkable similarity to locally adaptive regression splines. We also\nprovide theoretical support for these empirical findings; most notably, we\nprove that (with the right choice of tuning parameter) the trend filtering\nestimate converges to the true underlying function at the minimax rate for\nfunctions whose $k$th derivative is of bounded variation.

In order to do this, we model the image as a random\nfield. So far, little research has been performed on analyzing directionality\nin random fields. In this paper, we propose a measure to quantify the degree of\ndirectionality based on the random monogenic signal, which enables a unique\ndecomposition of a 2D signal into local amplitude, local orientation, and local\nphase. We investigate the second-order statistical properties of the monogenic\nsignal for isotropic, anisotropic, and unidirectional random fields.
