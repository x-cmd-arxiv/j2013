In 2009, a warm Spitzer survey observed 30 SNe IIn\ndiscovered in 2003 - 2008 and detected 10 SNe at distances out to 175 Mpc with\nunreported late-time infrared emission, in some cases more than 5 years\npost-discovery. For this single epoch of data, the warm-dust parameters suggest\nthe presence of a radiative heating source consisting of optical/X-ray emission\ncontinuously generated by ongoing CSM interaction. Here we present\nmulti-wavelength follow-up observations of this sample of 10 SNe IIn and the\nwell-studied Type IIn SN 2010jl. A recent epoch of Spitzer observations reveals\nongoing mid-infrared emission from nine of the SNe in this sample. We also\ndetect three of the SNe in archival WISE data, in addition to SNe 1987A,\n2004dj, and 2008iy. For at least five of the SNe in the sample, optical and/or\nX-ray emission confirms the presence of radiative emission from ongoing CSM\ninteraction. The two Spitzer nondetections are consistent with the forward\nshock overrunning and destroying the dust shell, a result that places upper\nlimits on the dust-shell size. The optical and infrared observations confirm\nthe radiative heating model and constrain a number of model parameters,\nincluding progenitor mass-loss characteristics. All of the SNe in this sample\nexperienced an outburst on the order of tens to hundreds of years prior to the\nSN explosion followed by periods of less intense mass loss. Although all\nevidence points to massive progenitors, the variation in the data highlights\nthe diversity in SN IIn progenitor evolution. While these observations do not\nidentify a particular progenitor system, they demonstrate that future,\ncoordinated, multi-wavelength campaigns can constrain theoretical mass-loss\nmodels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 31 Mar 2013 20:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

As a result, the reduced-order model loses its\ncomputational efficiency, which, however, is its the most significant\nadvantage. Nonlinear dimensional reduction methods, such as the discrete\nempirical interpolation method, have been widely used to evaluate the nonlinear\nterms at a low cost. But when the finite element method is utilized for the\nspatial discretization, nonlinear snapshot generation requires inner products\nto be fulfilled, which costs lots of off-line time. Numerical integrations are\nalso needed over elements sharing the selected interpolation points during the\nsimulation, which keeps on-line time high. In this paper, we extend the finite\nelement method with interpolated coefficients to nonlinear reduced-order\nmodels. It approximates the nonlinear function in the reduced-order model by\nits finite element interpolation, which makes coefficient matrices of the\nnonlinear terms pre-computable and, thus, leads to great savings in the\ncomputational efforts. Due to the separation of spatial and temporal variables\nin the finite element interpolation, the discrete empirical interpolation\nmethod can be directly applied on the nonlinear functions. Therefore, the main\ncomputational hurdles when applying the discrete empirical interpolation method\nin the finite element context are conquered. We also establish a rigorous\nasymptotic error estimation, which shows that the proposed approach achieves\nthe same accuracy as that of the standard finite element method under certain\nsmoothness assumptions of the nonlinear functions. Several numerical tests are\npresented to validate the proposed method and verify the theoretical results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Apr 2013 01:50:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 28 Apr 2013 02:30:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-30"}

These patterns are often\ninduced by an elastic misfit which compresses the film. Blistering permits the\nfilm to expand locally, reducing the elastic energy of the system. It is\nnatural to ask: what is the minimum elastic energy achievable by blistering on\na fixed area fraction of the substrate? This is a variational problem involving\nboth the {\\it elastic deformation} of the film and substrate and the {\\it\ngeometry} of the blistered region. It involves three small parameters: the {\\it\nnondimensionalized thickness} of the film, the {\\it compliance ratio} of the\nfilm/substrate pair and the {\\it mismatch strain}. In formulating the problem,\nwe use a small-slope (F\\\"oppl-von K\\'arm\\'an) approximation for the elastic\nenergy of the film, and a local approximation for the elastic energy of the\nsubstrate.\n  For a 1D version of the problem, we obtain \"matching\" upper and lower bounds\non the minimum energy, in the sense that both bounds have the same scaling\nbehavior with respect to the small parameters.

The running quartic self-coupling\ndecreases and crosses zero somewhere in the very high energy scale. It is\nusually considered as a signal of the instability of the standard model (SM)\nvacuum, but it can also indicate a link between the physics in the electroweak\nscale and the Planck scale. Furthermore, the LHC experiments as well as the\nflavor physics experiments give strong constraints on the physics beyond the\nSM. It urges us to reconsider the widely taken approach to the physics beyond\nthe SM (BSM), namely the approach based on the gauge unification below the\nPlanck scale and the resulting hierarchy problem. Motivated by the recent\nexperiments, we first revisit the hierarchy problem and consider an alternative\nappoach based on a classical conformality of the SM without the Higgs mass\nterm.\n  In this talk, I review our recent proposal of a B-L extension of the SM with\na flat Higgs potential at the Planck scale. This model can be an alternative\nsolution to the hierarchy problem as well as being phenomenologically viable to\nexplain the neutrino oscillations and the baryon asymmetry of the universe.\nWith an assumption that the Higgs has a flat potential at the Planck scale, we\nshow that the B-L symmetry is radiatively broken at the TeV scale via the\nColeman-Weinberg mechanism, and it triggers the electroweak symmetry breaking\nthrough a radiatively generated scalar mixing. The ratio of these two breaking\nscales is dynamically determined by the B-L gauge coupling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Apr 2013 04:09:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-23"}

Applying this expression to\nthe WMAP likelihood, we verify that the effect of correlations on cosmological\nparameters in the transition region is negligible in terms of cosmological\nparameters for WMAP; the largest relative shift seen for any parameter is\n0.06\\sigma. However, because this may not hold for other experimental setups\n(e.g., for different instrumental noise properties or analysis masks), but must\nrather be verified on a case-by-case basis, we recommend our new hybridization\nscheme for future experiments for statistical self-consistency reasons.

Its origin remains unknown despite decades of scrutiny. We propose a\nnovel scenario in which known extragalactic positron sources such as radio jets\nof active galactic nuclei (AGN) fill the intergalactic medium with MeV e+e-\npairs, which are then accreted into the Milky Way. We show that interpreting\nthe diffuse cosmic radio background (CRB) as arising from radio sources with\ncharacteristics similar to the observed cores and radio lobes in powerful AGN\njets suggests that the intergalactic positron-to-electron ratio could be as\nhigh as 10^{-5}, although this can be decreased if the CRB is not all produced\nby pairs and if not all positrons escape to the intergalactic medium. Assuming\nan accretion rate of one solar mass per year of matter into the Milky Way, a\npositron-to-electron ratio of only 10^{-7} is already enough to account for\nmuch of the 511 keV emission of the Galaxy. A simple spherical accretion model\npredicts an emission profile highly peaked in the central bulge, consistent\nwith INTEGRAL observations. However, a realistic model of accretion with\nangular momentum would likely imply a more extended emission over the disk,\nwith uncertainties depending on the magnetic field structure and turbulence in\nthe galactic halo.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Apr 2013 10:09:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-02"}

Recent observations, by comparison, reveal that many\nsolar-type stars show large-scale surface magnetic fields that are highly\nnon-potential - that is, they have been stressed above their lowest-energy\nstate. This non-potential component of the surface field is neglected by\ncurrent stellar wind models. The aim of this paper is to determine its effect\non the coronal structure and wind. We use Zeeman-Doppler surface magnetograms\nof two stars - one with an almost potential, one with a non-potential surface\nfield - to extrapolate a static model of the coronal structure for each star.\nWe find that the stresses are carried almost exclusively in a band of\nuni-directional azimuthal field that is confined to mid-latitudes. Using this\nstatic solution as an initial state for an MHD wind model, we then find that\nthe final state is determined primarily by the potential component of the\nsurface magnetic field. The band of azimuthal field must be confined close to\nthe stellar surface as it is not compatible with a steady-state wind. By\nartificially increasing the stellar rotation rate we demonstrate that the\nobserved azimuthal fields can not be produced by the action of the wind but\nmust be due to processes at or below the stellar surface. We conclude that the\nbackground winds of solar-like stars are largely unaffected by these\nhighly-stressed surface fields. Nonetheless, the increased flare activity and\nassociated coronal mass ejections that may be expected to accompany such\nhighly-stressed fields may have a significant impact on any surrounding\nplanets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Apr 2013 13:26:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

As a particular example, we consider transition\nradiation from vortex electrons obliquely incident on an interface between a\nvacuum and a dispersive medium, in which the magnetic moment contribution\nmanifests itself via a left-right angular asymmetry. For electrons with E_e =\n300 keV and \\ell = 100-1000, we predict an asymmetry of the order of 0.1%-1%,\nwhich could be measured with existing technology. Thus, vortex electrons emerge\nas a new tool in the physics of electromagnetic radiation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Apr 2013 14:07:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 20 Jul 2013 18:18:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-23"}

The\nmeasurement must however overcome astrometric distortions which are much larger\nthan the photon noise limit. To address this issue, we propose to generate\nfaint stellar diffraction spikes using a two-dimensional grid of regularly\nspaced small dark spots added to the surface of the primary mirror (PM).\nAccurate astrometric motion of the host star is obtained by comparing the\nposition of the spikes to the background field stars. The spikes do not\ncontribute to scattered light in the central part of the field and therefore\nallow unperturbed coronagraphic observation of the star's immediate\nsurrounding. Because the diffraction spikes are created on the PM and imaged on\nthe same focal plane detector as the background stars, astrometric distortions\naffect equally the diffraction spikes and the background stars, and are\ntherefore calibrated. We describe the technique, detail how the data collected\nby the wide-field camera are used to derive astrometric motion, and identify\nthe main sources of astrometric error using numerical simulations and\nanalytical derivations.

We focus on such defects because they can be used to\ncreate and control magnetism in graphene-based materials. Our main results are\nsummarized as follows: i)Substitutional metal impurities are fully understood\nusing a model based on the hybridization between the $d$ states of the metal\natom and the defect levels associated with an unreconstructed D$_{3h}$ carbon\nvacancy. We identify three different regimes, associated with the occupation of\ndistinct hybridization levels, which determine the magnetic properties obtained\nwith this type of doping; ii) A spin moment of 1.0 $\\mu_B$ is always induced by\nchemical functionalization when a molecule chemisorbs on a graphene layer via a\nsingle C-C (or other weakly polar) covalent bond. The magnetic coupling between\nadsorbates shows a key dependence on the sublattice adsorption site. This\neffect is similar to that of H adsorption, however, with universal character;\niii) The spin moment of substitutional metal impurities can be controlled using\nstrain. In particular, we show that although Ni substitutionals are\nnon-magnetic in flat and unstrained graphene, the magnetism of these defects\ncan be activated by applying either uniaxial strain or curvature to the\ngraphene layer.

These packets have a lot of features. But not all of them\nis required to be analyzed to detect that specific type of attack. Detection\nspeed and computational cost is another vital matter here, because in these\ntypes of problems, datasets are very huge regularly. In this paper we tried to\npropose a very simple and fast feature selection method to eliminate features\nwith no helpful information on them. Result faster learning in process of\nredundant feature omission. We compared our proposed method with three most\nsuccessful similarity based feature selection algorithm including Correlation\nCoefficient, Least Square Regression Error and Maximal Information Compression\nIndex. After that we used recommended features by each of these algorithms in\ntwo popular classifiers including: Bayes and KNN classifier to measure the\nquality of the recommendations. Experimental result shows that although the\nproposed method can't outperform evaluated algorithms with high differences in\naccuracy, but in computational cost it has huge superiority over them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Apr 2013 05:27:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-13"}
