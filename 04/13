The role of galaxy merging versus secular processes in triggering\nnuclear activity is also discussed in the framework of recent galaxy/black hole\nco-evolutionary scenarios. Finally, the limits of current instrumentation in\nthe detection of the most obscured and distant black holes are discussed and\nsome possible directions to overcome these limits are presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Apr 2013 16:02:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-15"}

Unfortunately, the Rips complex is\ngenerally high-dimensional. To remedy this problem, it is tempting to simplify\nit through a sequence of collapses.

The components of the\nmetric are assumed to be expressible in power series in $m/r$, with $m$ being\nhalf the Schwarzschild radius of the central body and $r$ a radial coordinate.\nThe procedure exclusively works for a light ray which may be described as a\nperturbation in powers of $G$ of a Minkowskian null geodesic, with $G$ being\nthe Newtonian gravitational constant. It is shown that the expansion of the\ntravel time of a photon along such a ray only involves elementary integrals\nwhatever the order of approximation. An expansion of the impact parameter in\npower series of $G$ is also obtained. The method is applied to explicitly\ncalculate the perturbation expansions of the light travel time and the impact\nparameter up to the third order. The full expressions yielding the terms of\norder $G^3$ are new. The expression of the travel time confirms the existence\nof a third-order enhanced term when the emitter and the receiver are in\nconjunction relative to the central body. This term is shown to be necessary\nfor determining the post-Newtonian parameter $\\gamma$ at a level of accuracy of\n$10^{-8}$ with light rays grazing the Sun.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Apr 2013 17:04:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 4 Jul 2013 13:08:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 9 Apr 2014 14:38:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

We assume that a simple\npopulation-averaged scaling relation between the AGN X-ray luminosity L_X and\nthe host dark matter halo mass M_h exists. With such a relation, the AGN X-ray\nluminosity function can be computed from the halo mass function. Using the\nconcordance LCDM halo mass function for the latter, we obtain the M_h-L_X\nrelation required to match the redshift-dependent AGN X-ray luminosity function\nknown from X-ray observations. We find that with a simple power-law-scaling M_h\n\\propto L_X^\\Gamma(z), our model can successfully reproduce the observed X-ray\nluminosity function. Furthermore, we automatically obtain predictions for the\nlarge-scale AGN clustering amplitudes and their dependence on the luminosity\nand redshift, which seem to be compatible with AGN clustering measurements.

As a consequence they are likely to be\nmarkers for biased, over-dense regions where early galaxies cluster, regions\nthat eventually grow into the groups and clusters seen in the lower redshift\nuniverse. In this paper we explore the clustering of galaxies around z ~ 5 QSOs\nas traced by Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs). We target the fields of three QSOs\nusing the same optical imaging and spectroscopy techniques used in the ESO\nRemote Galaxy Survey (ERGS, Douglas et al. 2009, 2010), which was successful in\nidentifying individual clustered structures of LBGs. We use the statistics of\nthe redshift clustering in ERGS to show that two of the three fields show\nsignificant clustering of LBGs at the QSO redshifts. Neither of these fields is\nobviously over-dense in LBGs from the imaging alone; a possible reason why\nprevious imaging-only studies of high-redshift QSO environments have given\nambiguous results. This result shows that luminous QSOs at z ~ 5 are typically\nfound in over-dense regions. The richest QSO field contains at least nine\nspectroscopically confirmed objects at the same redshift including the QSO\nitself, seven LBGs and a second fainter QSO. While this is a very strong\nobservational signal of clustering at z ~ 5, it is of similar strength to that\nseen in two structures identified in the 'blank sky' ERGS fields. This\nindicates that, while over-dense, the QSO environments are not more extreme\nthan other structures that can be identified at these redshifts. The three\nrichest structures discovered in this work and in ERGS have properties\nconsistent with that expected for proto-clusters and likely represent the early\nstages in the build-up of massive current-day groups and clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Apr 2013 20:00:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

The Lagrangian 1-form of charged particle dynamics is Lie\ntransformed without introducing a gyro-gauge, but using directly the unit\nvector of the component of the velocity perpendicular to the magnetic field as\nthe coordinate corresponding to Larmor gyration. The reduction is shown to\nprovide a maximal reduction for the Lagrangian and to work to all orders in the\nLarmor radius, following exactly the same procedure as when working with the\nstandard gauge-dependent coordinate. The gauge-dependence is removed from the\ncoordinate system by using a constrained variable for the gyro-angle. The\nclosed 1-form d teta is replaced by a more general non-closed 1-form, which is\nequal to d theta in the gauge-dependent case. The gauge vector is replaced by a\nmore general connection in the definition of the gradient, which behaves as a\ncovariant derivative, in perfect agreement with the circle-bundle picture.

For this reason, it is important to have efficient\ncomputational methods and algorithms that can be applied on large datasets,\nsuch that it is still possible to complete the machine learning tasks in\nreasonable time. In this context, we present in this paper a more accurate\nsimple process to speed up ML methods. An unsupervised clustering algorithm is\ncombined with Expectation, Maximization (EM) algorithm to develop an efficient\nHidden Markov Model (HMM) training. The idea of the proposed process consists\nof two steps. In the first step, training instances with similar inputs are\nclustered and a weight factor which represents the frequency of these instances\nis assigned to each representative cluster. Dynamic Time Warping technique is\nused as a dissimilarity function to cluster similar examples. In the second\nstep, all formulas in the classical HMM training algorithm (EM) associated with\nthe number of training instances are modified to include the weight factor in\nappropriate terms. This process significantly accelerates HMM training while\nmaintaining the same initial, transition and emission probabilities matrixes as\nthose obtained with the classical HMM training algorithm. Accordingly, the\nclassification accuracy is preserved. Depending on the size of the training\nset, speedups of up to 2200 times is possible when the size is about 100.000\ninstances. The proposed approach is not limited to training HMMs, but it can be\nemployed for a large variety of MLs methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Apr 2013 22:23:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-16"}

The most common (50 %) C IV\nline morphology in CTTSs is that of a low-velocity NC together with a\nredshifted BC. The velocity centroids of the BCs and NCs are such that V_BC > 4\n* V_NC, consistent with the predictions of the accretion shock model, in at\nmost 12 out of 22 CTTSs.

Our key insight is that many operating systems, including\nUnix-like ones, abstract I/O devices as device files. There is a small and\nstable set of operations on device files, therefore, I/O virtualization at the\ndevice file boundary requires a one-time effort to support various I/O devices.\n  We present devirtualization, our design of I/O virtualization at the device\nfile boundary and its implementation for Linux/x86 systems. We are able to\nvirtualize various GPUs, input devices, cameras, and audio devices with fewer\nthan 4900 LoC, of which only about 300 are specific to I/O device classes. Our\nmeasurements show that devirtualized devices achieve interactive performance\nindistinguishable from native ones by human users, even when running 3D HD\ngames.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Apr 2013 04:04:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-16"}

Many studies in the extant ITS literature attempted to\naddress these issues within which various research methodologies were adopted.\nHowever, there is very few paper summarized what does optimal control theory\n(OCT), one of the sharpest tools to tackle management issues in engineering, do\nin solving these issues. It{\\textquoteright}s both important and interesting to\nanswer the following two questions. (1) How does OCT contribute to ITS research\nobjectives? (2) What are the research gaps and possible future research\ndirections? We searched 11 top transportation and control journals and reviewed\n41 research articles in ITS area in which OCT was used as the main research\nmethodology.

We illustrate this with a\nsingle atom interacting resonantly with two fixed static centers. At a Feshbach\nresonance point with orbital angular momentum $L\\ge1$, we find $2L+1$ shallow\nbound states whose energies behave like $1/R^{2L+1}$ when the distance $R$\nbetween the two centers is large.

These protocols enable a\ncomputationally weak verifier to offload computations to a powerful but\nuntrusted prover, while providing the verifier with a guarantee that the prover\nperformed the computations correctly. Despite substantial progress, existing\nimplementations are not yet practical. The main bottleneck is typically the\nextra effort required by the prover to return an answer with a guarantee of\ncorrectness, compared to returning an answer with no guarantee.\n  We describe a refinement of a powerful interactive proof protocol originally\ndue to Goldwasser, Kalai, and Rothblum. Cormode, Mitzenmacher, and Thaler show\nhow to implement the prover in this protocol in time O(S log S), where S is the\nsize of an arithmetic circuit computing the function of interest. Our\nrefinements apply to circuits whose wiring pattern is sufficiently \"regular\";\nfor these circuits, we bring the runtime of the prover down to O(S). That is,\nour prover can evaluate the circuit with a guarantee of correctness, with only\na constant-factor blowup in work compared to evaluating the circuit with no\nguarantee.\n  We argue that our refinements capture a large class of circuits, and prove\nsome theorems formalizing this. Experimentally, our refinements yield a 200x\nspeedup for the prover over the implementation of Cormode et al., and our\nprover is less than 10x slower than a C++ program that simply evaluates the\ncircuit. Along the way, we describe a special-purpose protocol for matrix\nmultiplication that is of interest in its own right.\n  Our final contribution is a protocol targeted at general data parallel\ncomputation.

In this setting, a computationally weak\nverifier (cloud user), lacking the resources to store and manipulate his\nmassive input locally, accesses a powerful but untrusted prover (cloud\nservice). The verifier must work within the restrictive data streaming\nparadigm. The prover, who can annotate the data stream as it is read, must not\njust supply the answer but also convince the verifier of its correctness.\nIdeally, both the amount of annotation and the space used by the verifier\nshould be sublinear in the relevant input size parameters.\n  A rich theory of such algorithms -- which we call schemes -- has emerged.\nPrior work has shown how to leverage the prover's power to efficiently solve\nproblems that have no non-trivial standard data stream algorithms. However,\nwhile optimal schemes are now known for several basic problems, such optimality\nholds only for streams whose length is commensurate with the size of the data\nuniverse. In contrast, many real-world datasets are relatively sparse,\nincluding graphs that contain only O(n^2) edges, and IP traffic streams that\ncontain much fewer than the total number of possible IP addresses, 2^128 in\nIPv6.\n  We design the first schemes that allow both the annotation and the space\nusage to be sublinear in the total number of stream updates rather than the\nsize of the data universe. We solve significant problems, including variations\nof INDEX, SET-DISJOINTNESS, and FREQUENCY-MOMENTS, plus several natural\nproblems on graphs. On the other hand, we give a new lower bound that, for the\nfirst time, rules out smooth tradeoffs between annotation and space usage for a\nspecific problem. Our technique brings out new nuances in Merlin-Arthur\ncommunication complexity models, and provides a separation between online\nversions of the MA and AMA models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Apr 2013 15:17:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-16"}
