However, most studies of OAT image reconstruction still employ\ntwo-dimensional (2D) imaging models. One important reason is because 3D image\nreconstruction is computationally burdensome. The aim of this work is to\naccelerate existing image reconstruction algorithms for 3D OAT by use of\nparallel programming techniques.\n  Methods: Parallelization strategies are proposed to accelerate a filtered\nbackprojection (FBP) algorithm and two different pairs of\nprojection/backprojection operations that correspond to two different numerical\nimaging models. The algorithms are designed to fully exploit the parallel\ncomputing power of graphic processing units (GPUs). In order to evaluate the\nparallelization strategies for the projection/backprojection pairs, an\niterative image reconstruction algorithm is implemented. Computer-simulation\nand experimental studies are conducted to investigate the computational\nefficiency and numerical accuracy of the developed algorithms.\n  Results: The GPU implementations improve the computational efficiency by\nfactors of 1, 000, 125, and 250 for the FBP algorithm and the two pairs of\nprojection/backprojection operators, respectively. Accurate images are\nreconstructed by use of the FBP and iterative image reconstruction algorithms\nfrom both computer-simulated and experimental data.\n  Conclusions: Parallelization strategies for 3D OAT image reconstruction are\nproposed for the first time. These GPU-based implementations significantly\nreduce the computational time for 3D image reconstruction, complementing our\nearlier work on 3D OAT iterative image reconstruction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Apr 2013 16:20:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-09"}

An important\ncharacteristic of this process is the multi-lineage priming, which requires the\nsimultaneous expression of lineage-specific genes. Prior to commitment to a\ncertain lineage, it has been observed that these genes exhibit intermediate\nvalues of their expression levels. Multi-lineage differentiation has been\nreported for various progenitor cells, and it has been explained through the\nbifurcation of a metastable state. During the differentiation process the\ndynamics of the core regulatory network follows a bifurcation, where the\nmetastable state, corresponding to the progenitor cell, is destabilized and the\nsystem is forced to choose between the possible developmental alternatives.\nWhile this approach gives a reasonable interpretation of the cell fate decision\nprocess, it fails to explain the multi-lineage priming characteristic. Here, we\ndescribe a new multi-dimensional switch-like model that captures both the\nprocess of cell fate decision and the phenomenon of multi-lineage priming. We\nshow that in the symmetrical interaction case, the system exhibits a new type\nof degenerate bifurcation, characterized by a critical hyperplane, containing\nan infinite number of critical steady states. This critical hyperplane may be\ninterpreted as the support for the multi-lineage priming states of the\nprogenitor. Also, the cell fate decision (the multi-stability and switching\nbehavior) can be explained by a symmetry breaking in the parameter space of\nthis critical hyperplane. These analytical results are confirmed by Monte-Carlo\nsimulations of the corresponding chemical master equations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Apr 2013 20:06:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-09"}

In this\npaper, we quantify precisely Heisenberg's intuition. Even if two incompatible\nobservables cannot be measured together, one can still approximate their joint\nmeasurement, at the price of introducing some errors with respect to the ideal\nmeasurement of each of them. We present a new, tight relation characterizing\nthe optimal trade-off between the error on one observable versus the error on\nthe other. As a particular case, our approach allows us to characterize the\ndisturbance of an observable induced by the approximate measurement of another\none; we also derive a stronger error-disturbance relation for this scenario.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Apr 2013 22:23:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-06"}

Our\nalgorithm maintains an arbitrary flow that may have some residual excess and\ndeficits, while taking steps to minimize a potential function measuring the\ncongestion of the current flow plus an over-estimate of the congestion required\nto route the residual demand. Since the residual term over-estimates, the\ndescent process gradually moves the contribution to our potential function from\nthe residual term to the congestion term, eventually achieving a flow routing\nthe desired demands with nearly minimal congestion after\n$\\tilde{O}(\\alpha\\eps^{-2}\\log^2 n)$ iterations.

For solving linear equations, iterative methods are\npreferred over the direct methods especially when the coefficient matrix is\nsparse. The rate of convergence of iteration method is increased by using\nSuccessive Relaxation (SR) technique. But SR technique is very much sensitive\nto relaxation factor, {\\omega}. Recently, hybridization of classical\nGauss-Seidel based successive relaxation technique with evolutionary\ncomputation techniques have successfully been used to solve large set of linear\nequations in which relaxation factors are self-adapted. In this paper, a new\nhybrid algorithm is proposed in which uniform adaptive evolutionary computation\ntechniques and classical Jacobi based SR technique are used instead of\nclassical Gauss-Seidel based SR technique. The proposed Jacobi-SR based uniform\nadaptive hybrid algorithm, inherently, can be implemented in parallel\nprocessing environment efficiently.

However, the residual {\\it enhancement}, defined\nvia appropriate subtractions of leading contributions from the total specific\nheat, is dominated (away from $T_{1c}$ and $T_{2c}$) by a decay factor\n$1/(m_1+m_2)$ arising from the {\\it seams} (or boundaries) separating the\nstrips; close to $T_{1c}$ and $T_{2c}$ the decay is slower by a factor $\\ln\nm_1$ and $\\ln m_2$, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Apr 2013 05:54:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 30 Jun 2013 18:49:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 11 Sep 2013 20:25:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-30"}

The\noscillatory structure is reminiscent of beating patterns between quantum states\nand is strongly suggestive of the presence of long-lived molecular electronic\ncoherence. Significantly, however, a detailed analysis of the electronic\ncoherence properties shows that the oscillatory structure arises from a purely\nincoherent process.

Essentially, a key challenge of\nthis problem is its high computational complexity. In this paper, we propose a\ndynamical programming based method to solve this problem. Our method consists\nof two separate stages: an offline pre-processing stage and an online search\nstage. The offline stage pre-computes optimal potential sequence candidates\nfrom a set of pick-up points, and the online stage selects the optimal driving\nroute based on the pre-computed sequences with the current position of an empty\ntaxi. Specifically, for the offline pre-computation, a backward incremental\nsequence generation algorithm is proposed based on the iterative property of\nthe cost function. Simultaneously, an incremental pruning policy is adopted in\nthe process of sequence generation to reduce the search space of the potential\nsequences effectively. In addition, a batch pruning algorithm can also be\napplied to the generated potential sequences to remove the non-optimal ones of\na certain length. Since the pruning effect continuously increases with the\nincrease of the sequence length, our method can search the optimal driving\nroute efficiently in the remaining potential sequence candidates. Experimental\nresults on real and synthetic data sets show that the pruning percentage of our\nmethod is significantly improved compared to the state-of-the-art methods,\nwhich makes our method can be used to handle the problem of mobile sequential\nrecommendation with more pick-up points and to search the optimal driving\nroutes in arbitrary length ranges.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Apr 2013 09:35:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-09"}

Here, 'inhomogeneous' means that the wave is attenuated in\na direction distinct from the direction of propagation and 'longitudinal' means\nthat the wave is elliptically polarized in the plane containing these two\ndirections. In other words, the displacement is of the form u = Re {S exp[i\n(omega S.x - ct)]}, where S is a complex vector (or bivector).\n  Then a Generalized Hadamard material is introduced. It is the most general\nhomogeneous isotropic compressible material which allows the propagation of\ninfinitesimal 'longitudinal' inhomogeneous plane circularly polarized waves for\nall choices of the isotropic directional bivector.\n  Finally, the most general forms of response functions are found for\nhomogeneously deformed isotropic elastic materials in which 'longitudinal'\ninhomogeneous plane waves may propagate with a circular polarization in each of\nthe two planes of central circular section of the B^n-ellipsoid, where B is the\nleft Cauchy-Green strain tensor corresponding to the primary pure homogeneous\ndeformation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Apr 2013 09:40:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-09"}

Early theoretical work tried to explain\ncorrelated activity by neurons transmitting common fluctuations due to shared\ninputs. This, however, overestimates correlations. Recently the recurrent\nconnectivity of cortical networks was shown responsible for the observed low\nbaseline correlations. Two different explanations were given: One argues that\nexcitatory and inhibitory population activities closely follow the external\ninputs to the network, so that their effects on a pair of cells mutually\ncancel. Another explanation relies on negative recurrent feedback to suppress\nfluctuations in the population activity, equivalent to small correlations. In a\nbiological neuronal network one expects both, external inputs and recurrence,\nto affect correlated activity. The present work extends the theoretical\nframework of correlations to include both contributions and explains their\nqualitative differences.

The class of Natural-like SUSY\nspectra considered follows the typical Natural SUSY model made up of a gluino,\nthird-generation squarks, and higgsino sparticles, but is extended to more\ncomplex spectra containing sleptons. We show that the limits obtained from the\ncombination of inclusive topology searches are far more stable than those from\nindividual searches, with respect to the assumed underlying complexity of the\nspectra. Hence, these limits can be considered as universal mass limits on\ngluino and third-generation squarks, defined in the context of this broad class\nof Natural-like SUSY spectra. Furthermore, we present our results using a\nsimple colour scheme that allows a straightforward interpretation of any\nNatural-like SUSY spectrum with our limits.\n  Complementing the final results of the 2011 searches based on 5\n$\\textrm{fb}^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity, with the first published results\nfrom the 2012 searches using approximately 11 $\\textrm{fb}^{-1}$, we find that\ngluinos with a mass of $m_{\\tilde{g}}\\approx$ 1050 GeV and third-generation top\nand bottom squarks with masses of $m_{\\tilde{3G}}\\approx$ 575 GeV are excluded\nfor low masses of the lightest SUSY particle (LSP). We also establish a\nprediction of how these limits might evolve when the full 2012 data set is\nanalysed, with both the CMS and ATLAS experiments combined. The importance of\ncombining relevant inclusive topology searches, in order to make the most\nuniversal interpretations possible, is a general recommendation for future\nexperimental searches at the LHC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Apr 2013 12:33:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 Feb 2014 18:26:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-17"}

Starting from equations\nfor the two-time moments (e.g. for Cxy(t,s), Cxx(t,s)), the method uses an\nexact time-closure condition, in addition to a Gaussian moment closure, in\norder to obtain a closed, non-local in time (causal) subsystem for the one-time\n(t=s) moments. After solving this causal system, the two-time moments can be\ncalculated for all (t,s) pairs as well. The present method differs essentially\nfrom the classical It\\^o/FPK approach since it does not involve any specific\nassumptions regarding the correlation structure of the excitation. In the case\nwhere the input random process can be obtained as the solution of an It\\^o\nequation (as, e.g., happens with an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process), the proposed\nnon-local system is localized, leading to moment equations identical with the\nusual ones. The closed, non-local in time, moment system is numerically solved\nby means of an appropriate, two-scale, iterative scheme, and numerical results\nare presented for two families of colored stochastic excitations. The results\nare confirmed by means of extensive Monte Carlo simulations.

This way we\ncontinue our efforts to map the instability strips of beta Cep and SPB stars\nusing the combination of high-resolution ground-based spectroscopy and\nuninterrupted space-based photometry. Methods: We fit Keplerian orbits to\nradial velocities measured from selected absorption lines of high-resolution\nspectroscopy using synthetic composite spectra to obtain orbital solutions. We\nuse revised masks to obtain optimal light curves from the original pixel-data\nfrom the Kepler satellite, which provided better long term stability compared\nto the pipeline processed light curves. We use various time-series analysis\ntools to explore and describe the nature of variations present in the light\ncurve. Results: We find two eccentric double-lined spectroscopic binary systems\ncontaining a total of three main sequence B-type stars (and one F-type\ncomponent) of which at least one in each system exhibits light variations. The\nlight curve analysis (combined with spectroscopy) of the system of two B stars\npoints towards the presence of tidally excited g modes in the primary\ncomponent. We interpret the variations seen in the second system as classical g\nmode pulsations driven by the kappa mechanism in the B type primary, and\nexplain the unexpected power in the p mode region as a result of nonlinear\nresonant mode excitation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Apr 2013 13:27:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

The main weakness of the WE\nnotion is that it exists only in very restrictive cases. To overcome this\nlimitation, we introduce the notion of a Combinatorial Walrasian equilibium\n(CWE), a natural relaxation of WE. The difference between a CWE and a\n(non-combinatorial) WE is that the seller can package the items into\nindivisible bundles prior to sale, and the market does not necessarily clear.\n  We show that every valuation profile admits a CWE that obtains at least half\nof the optimal (unconstrained) social welfare. Moreover, we devise a poly-time\nalgorithm that, given an arbitrary allocation X, computes a CWE that achieves\nat least half of the welfare of X. Thus, the economic problem of finding a CWE\nwith high social welfare reduces to the algorithmic problem of social-welfare\napproximation. In addition, we show that every valuation profile admits a CWE\nthat extracts a logarithmic fraction of the optimal welfare as revenue.\nFinally, these results are complemented by strong lower bounds when the seller\nis restricted to using item prices only, which motivates the use of bundles.\nThe strength of our results derives partly from their generality - our results\nhold for arbitrary valuations that may exhibit complex combinations of\nsubstitutes and complements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Apr 2013 15:49:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-09"}

It is straightforward to find a formula for the velocity\nv of the moving system required to produce causality violation. This formula\ntypically yields a velocity very close to the speed of light (for instance, v/c\n> 0.97 for X-shaped microwaves), which raises some doubts about the real\nphysical observability of the violations. We then compute the velocity\nrequirement introducing a delay between the reception of the primary signal and\nthe emission of the secondary. It turns out that in principle for any delay it\nis possible to find moving observers able to produce active causal violation.\nThis is mathematically due to the singularity of the Lorentz transformations\nfor beta to 1. For a realistic delay due to the propagation of a luminal\nprecursor, we find that causality violations in the reported experiments are\nstill more unlikely (v/c > 0.989), and even in the hypothesis that the\nsuperluminal propagation velocity goes to infinity, the velocity requirement is\nbounded by v/c > 0.62.
