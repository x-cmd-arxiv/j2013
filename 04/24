In the low-energy\nlimit, for energies and momenta small compared to a characteristic symmetry\nbreaking scale of order 1 GeV, QCD is realized as an effective field theory of\nGoldstone bosons (pions) coupled to heavy fermionic sources (nucleons). Nuclear\nforces at long and intermediate distance scales result from a systematic\nhierarchy of one- and two-pion exchange processes in combination with Pauli\nblocking effects in the nuclear medium. Short distance dynamics, not resolved\nat the wavelengths corresponding to typical nuclear Fermi momenta, are\nintroduced as contact interactions between nucleons. Apart from a set of\nlow-energy constants associated with these contact terms, the parameters of\nthis theory are entirely determined by pion properties and low-energy\npion-nucleon scattering observables. This framework (in-medium chiral\nperturbation theory) can provide a realistic description of both\nisospin-symmetric nuclear matter and neutron matter. The importance of\nthree-body forces is emphasized, and the role of explicit Delta(1232)-isobar\ndegrees of freedom is investigated in detail. Nuclear chiral thermodynamics is\ndeveloped and a calculation of the nuclear phase diagram is performed. This\nincludes a successful description of the first-order phase transition from a\nnuclear Fermi liquid to an interacting Fermi gas and the coexistence of these\nphases below a critical temperature T_c. Density functional methods for finite\nnuclei based on this approach are also discussed. Effective interactions, their\ndensity dependence and connections to Landau Fermi liquid theory are outlined.\nFinally, the density and temperature dependence of the chiral (quark)\ncondensate is investigated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Apr 2013 17:06:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

For this we use a\nwell-known result from parametric estimation theory, the so-called Cramer-Rao\nlower bound. We develop the expressions in the 1-dimensional case of a linear\narray detector in which the only unknown parameter is the source position. If\nthe object is oversampled by the detector, analytical expressions can be\nobtained for the Cramer-Rao limit that can be readily used to estimate the\nlimiting precision of an imaging system, and which are very useful for\nexperimental (detector) design, observational planning, or performance\nestimation of data analysis software: In particular, we demonstrate that for\nbackground-dominated sources, the maximum astrometric precision goes as\n$B/F^2$, where $B$ is the background in one pixel, and $F$ is the total flux of\nthe source, while when the background is negligible, this precision goes as\n$F^{-1}$. We also explore the dependency of the astrometric precision on: (1)\nthe size of the source (as imaged by the detector), (2) the pixel detector\nsize, and (3) the effect of source de-centering. Putting these results into\ncontext, the theoretical Cramer-Rao lower bound is compared to both ground- as\nwell as spaced-based astrometric results, indicating that current techniques\napproach this limit very closely. Our results indicate that we have found in\nthe Cramer-Rao lower variance bound a very powerful astrometric \"benchmark\"\nestimator concerning the maximum expected positional precision for a point\nsource, given a prescription for the source, the background, the detector\ncharacteristics, and the detection process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Apr 2013 17:44:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

The flavor content of the signal evolves\ndue to both neutrino collective effects and matter effects which can lead to a\nhighly interesting interplay and distinctive spectral features. In this paper\nwe investigate the supernova neutrino flavor evolution in three different\nprogenitors and include collective flavor effects, the evolution of the\nMikheyev, Smirnov & Wolfenstein conversion due to the shock wave passage\nthrough the star, and the impact of turbulence. In the Oxygen-Neon-Magnesium\nsupernova we find that the impact of turbulence is both brief and slight during\na window of 1-2 seconds post bounce. Thus the spectral features of collective\nand shock effects in the neutrino signals from ONeMg supernovae may be almost\nturbulence free making them the easiest to interpret. For the more massive\nprogenitors we again find that small amplitude turbulence, up to 10%, leads to\na minimal modification of the signal, and the emerging neutrino spectra retain\nboth collective and MSW features. However, when larger amounts of turbulence is\nadded, 30% and 50%, the features of collective and shock wave effects in the\nhigh density resonance channel are almost completely obscured at late times.\nYet at the same time we find the other mixing channels - the low density\nresonance channel and the non-resonant channels - begin to develop turbulence\nsignatures. Large amplitude turbulent motions in the outer layers of more\nmassive, iron core-collapse supernovae may obscure the most obvious\nfingerprints of collective and shock wave effects in the neutrino signal but\ncannot remove them completely, and additionally bring about new features in the\nsignal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Apr 2013 18:27:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-09"}

In contrast to the large scatter (by a factor of 102-103) in the\nLX,Total - LB relation, we found a tight correlation between these physically\nmotivated quantities with a rms deviation of a factor of 3 in LX,Gas = 1038 -\n1043 erg s-1 or MTotal = a few x 1010 - a few x 1012 Mo.

In qualitative agreement with ab-initio calculations of\npolar solvents and ionic liquids, the hydration energy of a polarizable ion in\nboth type of dielectric liquid is shown to favor the expansion of its\nelectronic cloud. Namely, the ion carrying no dipole moment in the gas phase\nacquires a dipole moment in the liquid environment, but its electron cloud also\nreaches an enhanced rigidity. We find that the overall effect is an increase of\nthe gas phase polarizability upon hydration. In the specific case of ionic\nliquids, it is shown that this hydration process is driven by a collective\nsolvation mechanism where the dipole moment of a polarizable ion induced by its\ninteraction with surrounding ions self-consistently adds to the polarization of\nthe liquid, thereby amplifying the dielectric permittivity of the medium in a\nsubstantial way. We propose this self-consistent hydration as the underlying\nmechanism behind the high dielectric permittivities of ionic liquids composed\nof small charges with negligible gas phase dipole moment.

Several frequently computed metrics like the clustering\ncoefficient and the transitivity ratio need to count the number of triangles in\nthe network.

This deluge of data has the potential to revolutionize the\ncomputational efforts aimed at simulating scenarios and designing containment\nstrategies. However, the integration of detailed data sources yields models\nthat are less transparent and general. Hence, given a specific disease model,\nit is crucial to assess which representations of the raw data strike the best\nbalance between simplicity and detail. We consider high-resolution data on the\nface-to-face interactions of individuals in a hospital ward, obtained by using\nwearable proximity sensors. We simulate the spread of a disease in this\ncommunity by using an SEIR model on top of different mathematical\nrepresentations of the contact patterns.

We extend these results to infinite-dimensional\nHilbert spaces of field theories and matrix models. We consider a quench setup,\nwhere initial states are chosen from a microcanonical ensemble of finite energy\nin free theory, and then evolve with an arbitrary non-perturbative Hamiltonian.\nGiven a dynamical assumption on the expectation value of particle number\ndensity, we prove that small subsystems reach equilibrium at the level of\nquantum wave-function, and with respect to all observables. The picture that\nemerges is that at higher energies, larger subsystems can reach equilibrium.\nFor bosonic fields on a lattice, in the limit of large number of bosons per\nsite, all subsystem smaller than half equilibrate.

Dynamical models\npredict the formation of X-shaped bulges, as extreme cases of boxy-peanut\nbulges. However, since X-shaped bulges were known to be present only in\nexternal galaxies, models have never been compared to 3D kinematical data for\nindividual stars. We study the orbital motion of Galactic bulge stars, in the\ntwo arms of the X in the southern hemisphere. The goal is to provide\nobservational constraints to bulge formation models that predict the formation\nof X-shapes through bar dynamical instabilities. Radial velocities have been\nobtained for a sample of 454 bulge giants, roughly equally distributed between\nthe bright and faint RC, in a field at (l,b)=(0,-6). Proper motions were\nderived for all RC stars in the same field by combining images from two epochs\nobtained 11 years apart. The proper motions for the spectroscopic subsample are\nanalyzed taking into account the radial velocities and metallicities measured\nfrom near-IR Calcium triplet lines, for a subsample of 352 stars. The radial\nvelocity distribution of stars in the bright RC, tracing the closer overdensity\nof bulge stars, shows an excess of stars moving towards the Sun. Similarly, an\nexcess of stars receding from the Sun is seen in the far overdensity, traced by\nfaint RC stars. This is explained with the presence of stars on elongated\norbits, most likely streaming along the arms of the X-shaped bulge. Proper\nmotions for these stars are consistent with qualitative predictions of\ndynamical models of peanut-shaped bulges. Surprisingly, stars on elongated\norbits have preferentially metal poor metallicities, while the metal rich ones,\nin both overdensities, are preferentially found in more axysimmetric orbits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Apr 2013 21:24:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

In this paper we study, from a theoretical perspective, the\nwidely used Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG)-type ranking measures.\nAlthough there are extensive empirical studies of NDCG, little is known about\nits theoretical properties. We first show that, whatever the ranking function\nis, the standard NDCG which adopts a logarithmic discount, converges to 1 as\nthe number of items to rank goes to infinity. On the first sight, this result\nis very surprising. It seems to imply that NDCG cannot differentiate good and\nbad ranking functions, contradicting to the empirical success of NDCG in many\napplications. In order to have a deeper understanding of ranking measures in\ngeneral, we propose a notion referred to as consistent distinguishability. This\nnotion captures the intuition that a ranking measure should have such a\nproperty: For every pair of substantially different ranking functions, the\nranking measure can decide which one is better in a consistent manner on almost\nall datasets. We show that NDCG with logarithmic discount has consistent\ndistinguishability although it converges to the same limit for all ranking\nfunctions. We next characterize the set of all feasible discount functions for\nNDCG according to the concept of consistent distinguishability. Specifically we\nshow that whether NDCG has consistent distinguishability depends on how fast\nthe discount decays, and 1/r is a critical point. We then turn to the cut-off\nversion of NDCG, i.e., NDCG@k. We analyze the distinguishability of NDCG@k for\nvarious choices of k and the discount functions.

This paper explores the possibility of\noptimal combination of polynomial spaces that minimize the number of unknowns\nin the numerical scheme, yet without compromising the accuracy of the numerical\napproximation.

The current research and development in physical layer security is\noften based on the ideal assumption of perfect channel knowledge or the\ncapability of variable-rate transmissions. In this work, we study the secure\ntransmission design in more practical scenarios by considering channel\nestimation errors at the receiver and investigating both fixed-rate and\nvariable-rate transmissions. Assuming quasi-static fading channels, we design\nsecure on-off transmission schemes to maximize the throughput subject to a\nconstraint on secrecy outage probability. For systems with given and fixed\nencoding rates, we show how the optimal on-off transmission thresholds and the\nachievable throughput vary with the amount of knowledge on the eavesdropper's\nchannel. In particular, our design covers the interesting case where the\neavesdropper also uses the pilots sent from the transmitter to obtain imperfect\nchannel estimation. An interesting observation is that using too much pilot\npower can harm the throughput of secure transmission if both the legitimate\nreceiver and the eavesdropper have channel estimation errors, while the secure\ntransmission always benefits from increasing pilot power when only the\nlegitimate receiver has channel estimation errors but not the eavesdropper.\nWhen the encoding rates are controllable parameters to design, we further\nderive both a non-adaptive and an adaptive rate transmission schemes by jointly\noptimizing the encoding rates and the on-off transmission thresholds to\nmaximize the throughput of secure transmissions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Apr 2013 06:23:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Oct 2013 00:35:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-02"}

While\ninteroperability issues across different cloud platforms in a cloud federation\nhave been extensively studied, fundamental questions on cloud economics remain:\nWhen and how should a cloud trade resources (e.g., virtual machines) with\nothers, such that its net profit is maximized over the long run, while a\nclose-to-optimal social welfare in the entire federation can also be\nguaranteed? To answer this question, a number of important, inter-related\ndecisions, including job scheduling, server provisioning and resource pricing,\nshould be dynamically and jointly made, while the long-term profit optimality\nis pursued. In this work, we design efficient algorithms for inter-cloud\nvirtual machine (VM) trading and scheduling in a cloud federation. For VM\ntransactions among clouds, we design a double-auction based mechanism that is\nstrategyproof, individual rational, ex-post budget balanced, and efficient to\nexecute over time. Closely combined with the auction mechanism is a dynamic VM\ntrading and scheduling algorithm, which carefully decides the true valuations\nof VMs in the auction, optimally schedules stochastic job arrivals with\ndifferent SLAs onto the VMs, and judiciously turns on and off servers based on\nthe current electricity prices. Through rigorous analysis, we show that each\nindividual cloud, by carrying out the dynamic algorithm in the online double\nauction, can achieve a time-averaged profit arbitrarily close to the offline\noptimum. Asymptotic optimality in social welfare is also achieved under\nhomogeneous cloud settings. We carry out trace-driven simulations to examine\nthe effectiveness of our algorithms and the achievable social welfare under\nheterogeneous cloud settings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Apr 2013 07:11:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-25"}

A\nbasic tenet of the transmission sequence approach for addressing media access\ncontrol is that under normal operating conditions, there is no feedback\ntriggered re-transmission. This obviously is a major departure from the\nSlotted-ALOHA or CSMA type approaches. While these solutions enjoy excellent\nthroughput performance, a fundamental drawback is that they are based on\nfeedback information. For systems without naturally defined central controller\nthat can play the role of a base station, the task of providing feedback\ninformation could easily become unmanageable. This highlights the advantage of\nthe feedback-free approach. A second advantage is the ability to handle\nunlimited spatial coverage. We propose in this paper a concept for media access\ncontrol that is akin to frequency reuse. However, instead of reusing frequency,\nthe new approach allows transmission sequences be reused.

New formulas for k and k_bar in the context of density functional\ntheory with a non-local, integral expression for the interaction between\nmolecules are presented. These expressions are used to investigate the\ninfluence of the choice of Gibbs dividing surface and it is shown that for a\none-component system, the equimolar surface has a special status in the sense\nthat both k and k_bar are then the least sensitive to a change in the location\nof the dividing surface. Furthermore, the equimolar value for k corresponds to\nits maximum value and the equimolar value for k_bar corresponds to its minimum\nvalue. An explicit evaluation using a short-ranged interaction potential\nbetween molecules, shows that k is negative with a value around minus 0.5-1.0\nkT and that k_bar is positive with a value which is a bit more than half the\nmagnitude of k. Finally, for dispersion forces between molecules, we show that\na term proportional to log(R)/R^2 replaces the rigidity constants and we\ndetermine the (universal) proportionality constants.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Apr 2013 11:58:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

Several factors have been identified as potential\ncauses for barchan dune asymmetry on Earth and Mars: asymmetric bimodal wind\nregime, topography, influx asymmetry and dune collision. However, the dynamics\nand potential range of barchan morphologies emerging under each specific\nscenario that leads to dune asymmetry are far from being understood. In the\npresent work, we use dune modeling in order to investigate the formation and\nevolution of asymmetric barchans. We find that a bimodal wind regime causes\nlimb extension when the divergence angle between primary and secondary winds is\nlarger than $90^{\\circ}$, whereas the extended limb evolves into a seif dune if\nthe ratio between secondary and primary transport rates is larger than 25%.\nCalculations of dune formation on an inclined surface under constant wind\ndirection also lead to barchan asymmetry, however no seif dune is obtained from\nsurface tilting alone. Asymmetric barchans migrating along a tilted surface\nmove laterally, with transverse migration velocity proportional to the slope of\nthe terrain. Limb elongation induced by topography can occur when a barchan\ncrosses a topographic rise. Furthermore, transient asymmetric barchan shapes\nwith extended limb also emerge during collisions between dunes or due to an\nasymmetric influx. Our findings can be useful for making quantitative inference\non local wind regimes or spatial heterogeneities in transport conditions of\nplanetary dune fields hosting asymmetric barchans.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Apr 2013 13:20:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 2 Dec 2013 11:03:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-03"}

Furthermore, we show that the\ngain can go up to 30% for passwords that are actually based on personal\nattributes. These passwords are clearly weaker and should be avoided. Our\ncracker could be used by an organization to detect and reject them. To the best\nof our knowledge, we are the first to systematically study the relationship\nbetween chosen passwords and users' personal information.

The only significant heat source for partial\ndifferentiation is represented by Al26, the other possible sources (Fe60,\naccretion and differentiation) being negligible. In scenarios in which Lutetia\ncompleted its accretion in less than 0.7 Ma from injection of Al26 in Solar\nNebula and for post-sintering values of macroporosity not exceeding 30 vol. %,\nthe asteroid experienced only partial differentiation. The formation of the\nproto-core, a structure enriched in metals and also containing pristine\nsilicates, requires from 1 to 4 Ma: the size of the proto-core varies from 6 to\n30 km.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Apr 2013 14:35:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 29 May 2013 15:35:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-30"}

Finding the reduced\nmodel with minimal cost is computationally expensive, as it requires an\nexhaustive search among all state space partitions, and an exact evaluation of\nthe reduction cost for each candidate partition.

In particular, systems driven by Smoluchowski or\nNewtonian dynamics share the same static equilibrium and nonergodic states.\nThat these systems share the same nonergodic states is a highly nontrivial\nstatement and requires establishing a number of results. In the high-density\nregime one finds that an equilibrating system decays via a three-step process\nidentified in mode-coupling theory (MCT). For densities greater than a critical\ndensity one has time-power-law decay with exponents a and b. There are sets of\nlinear fluctuation dissipation relations (FDRs) which connect the cumulants of\nthese two fields. The form of the FDRs is the same for both Smoluchowski or\nNewtonian dynamics. While we show this universality of nonergodic states within\nperturbation theory, we expect it to be true more generally.\n  The nature of the approach to the nonergodic state has been suggested by MCT.\nIt has been a point of contention that MCT is a phenomenological theory and not\na systematic theory with prospects for improvement. Recently a systematic\ntheory has been developed. It naturally allows one to calculate\nself-consistently density cumulants in a perturbation expansion in a\npseudo-potential. At leading order one obtains a kinetic kernel quadratic in\nthe density. This is a \"one-loop\" theory like MCT. At this one-loop level one\nfinds vertex corrections which depend on the three-point equilibrium cumulants.\nHere we assume these vertex-corrections can be ignored and focus on the\nhigher-order loops.

The predicted mass spectra are similar to the time independent\nones with slightly shallower slopes at large masses and peak locations shifted\ntoward smaller masses by a factor of a few. Assuming that star-forming clumps\nfollow Larson type relations, we obtain core mass functions in good agreement\nwith the observationally derived IMF, in particular when taking into account\nthe thermodynamics of the gas. The time-dependent theory directly yields an\nanalytical expression for the star formation rate (SFR) at cloud scales. The\nSFR values agree well with the observational determinations of various Galactic\nmolecular clouds. Furthermore, we show that the SFR does not simply depend\nlinearly on density, as sometimes claimed in the literature, but depends also\nstrongly on the clump mass/size, which yields the observed scatter.

Recent sub-millimeter observations of disks around\nbrown dwarf measured low spectral indices of the continuum emission that\nsuggest that dust grains grow to mm-sizes even in these very low mass\nenvironments. To understand the first steps of planet formation in scaled-down\nversions of T-Tauri disks, we investigate the physical conditions that can\ntheoretically explain the growth from interstellar dust to millimeter-sized\ngrains in disks around brown dwarf. We modeled the evolution of dust particles\nunder conditions of low-mass disks around brown dwarfs. We used coagulation,\nfragmentation and disk-structure models to simulate the evolution of dust, with\nzero and non-zero radial drift. For the non-zero radial drift, we considered\nstrong inhomogeneities in the gas surface density profile that mimic long-lived\npressure bumps in the disk.

We apply the present model to black-hole X-ray binary\nLMC X-3 and narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxies, which are supposed to be under\ncritical accretion rate. Our results show clearly that the surface temperature\nis strongly depends on the thermal conduction, the magnetic field and advection\nparameter.

For this reason we propose alernative definitions of stability, which we\ncall local and hybrid variance, and which express how rewards on each run\ndeviate from the run's own mean-payoff and from the expected mean-payoff,\nrespectively.\n  We show that a strategy ensuring both the expected mean-payoff and the\nvariance below given bounds requires randomization and memory, under all the\nabove semantics of variance. We then look at the problem of determining whether\nthere is a such a strategy. For the global variance, we show that the problem\nis in PSPACE, and that the answer can be approximated in pseudo-polynomial\ntime. For the hybrid variance, the analogous decision problem is in NP, and a\npolynomial-time approximating algorithm also exists. For local variance, we\nshow that the decision problem is in NP. Since the overall performance can be\ntraded for stability (and vice versa), we also present algorithms for\napproximating the associated Pareto curve in all the three cases.\n  Finally, we study a special case of the decision problems, where we require a\ngiven expected mean-payoff together with zero variance.
