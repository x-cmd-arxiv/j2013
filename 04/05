The newly arising singularities may\nrepresent true endpoints of the evolution or allow for the extension of\ngeodesics through them. In the latter case the components of the Riemann tensor\nrepresenting tidal forces diverge. Sudden Future Singularities (SFS) occur at\nfinite time, finite scale factor and finite Hubble parameter, only the\ndeceleration parameter diverges. The energy density of a perfect fluid is\nregular and its pressure diverges at the SFS. A particular SFS, the Big Brake\noccurs when the energy density vanishes and the expansion arrives at a full\nstop at the singularity. Such scenarios are generated by either a particular\nscalar field (the tachyon field) or the anti-Chaplygin gas. By adding matter to\nthese models, an unwanted feature appears: at the finite scale factor of the\nSFS the energy density of matter remains finite, implying (for a spatially flat\nuniverse) a finite Hubble parameter, hence finite expansion rate, rather then\nfull stop. The universe would further expand through the singularity, this\nnevertheless seems forbidden as the energy density of the tachyonic field /\nanti-Chaplygin gas would become ill-defined. This paradox is relieved in the\ncase of the anti-Chaplygin gas by redefining its energy density and pressure in\nterms of distributions peaked on the singularity. The regular cosmological\nquantities, continuous across the SFS are the energy density and the square of\nthe Hubble parameter; those allowing for a jump at the SFS are the Hubble\nparameter and expansion rate (both being mirror-symmetric). The pressure and\nthe decelaration parameter will contain Dirac delta-function contributions\npeaked on the SFS, however they anyhow would diverge at the singularity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Apr 2013 16:19:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

In both former\nyears, Phaethon brightened unexpectedly by ~1 magnitude at large phase angles,\ninconsistent with the ~1 magnitude of steady fading expected from a discrete,\nmacroscopic body over the same phase angle range. With a perihelion distance of\n0.14 AU and surface temperatures up to ~1000 K, a thermal origin of this\nanomalous brightening is strongly suspected. However, simple thermal emission\nfrom Phaethon is too weak, by a factor >1000, to explain the brightening.\nNeither can ice survive on this body, ruling out comet-like sublimation. Our\npreferred explanation is that brightening occurs as a result of dust produced\nand ejected from Phaethon, perhaps by thermal fracture and/or thermal\ndecomposition of surface minerals when near perihelion. A contribution from\nprompt emission by oxygen released by desiccation of surface minerals cannot be\nexcluded. We infer an ejected mass of order 4x10^8 a_mm kg per outburst, where\na_mm is the mean dust radius in millimeters. For plausible dust radii, this\nmass is small compared to the estimated mass of Phaethon (~2x10^14 kg) and to\nthe mass of the Geminid stream (10^12 kg to 10^13 kg) with which Phaethon is\ndynamically associated.

We therefore finally have a\ncutoff independent model on a continuously parametrized world sheet. We study\nthis model in the mean field approximation, and as before, we find solitonic\nsolutions. Quantizing the solitonic collective coordinates gives rise to a\nstring like model. However, in contrast to the standard string model, the\ntrajectories here are not in general linear but curved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Apr 2013 18:59:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 31 May 2013 23:01:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

A large,\nhalf-degree diameter HI cloud was detected that shares the same position and\nvelocity as NGC 1569. Also, two long structures were discovered that are\nreminiscent of intergalactic filaments extending out in a v-shaped manner from\nNGC 1569 toward UGCA 92, a nearby dwarf galaxy. These filamentary structures\nextend for about 1.5 degrees, which is 77 kpc at NGC 1569. There is a\ncontinuous velocity succession with the 0.5 degree HI cloud, filaments, and\nmain body of the galaxy. The 0.5 degree HI cloud and filamentary structures may\nbe foreground Milky Way, but are suggestive as possible remnants of an\ninteraction between NGC 1569 and UGCA 92. The data also show two tidal tails\nextending from UGCA 86 and IC 342, respectively. These structures may be part\nof a continuous HI bridge but more data are needed to determine if this is the\ncase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Apr 2013 19:46:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

We find that, regardless of\nthe details of the equipartition scenario considered, the energy required to\nproduce the observed radio (i.e., energy in magnetic field and radio emitting\nelectrons) must increase by a factor of ~20 during the first 200 days. It then\nsaturates. This energy increase cannot be alleviated by a varying geometry of\nthe system. The radio data can be explained by: (i) An afterglow like emission\nof the X-ray emitting narrow relativistic jet. The additional energy can arise\nhere from a slower moving material ejected in the first few days that gradually\ncatches up with the slowing down blast wave (Berger et al. 2012). However, this\nrequires at least ~4x10^{53} erg in the slower moving outflow. This is much\nmore than the energy of the fast moving outflow that produced the early X-rays\nand it severely constrains the overall energy budget. (ii) Alternatively, the\nradio may arise from a mildly relativistic quasi-spherical outflow. Here, the\nenergy for the radio emission increases with time to at least ~10^{51} erg\nafter 200 days. This scenario requires, however, a second X-ray emitting\ncollimated relativistic component. Given these results, it is worthwhile to\nconsider models in which the energy of the magnetic field and/or of the radio\nemitting electrons increases with time without a continuous energy supply to\nthe blast wave. This can happen, for example, if the energy is injected\ninitially mostly in one form (Poynting flux or baryonic) and it is gradually\nconverted to the other form, leading to a deviation from equipartition. Another\nintriguing possibility is that a gradually decreasing Inverse Compton cooling\nmodifies the synchrotron emission and leads to an increase of the available\nenergy in the radio emitting electrons (Kumar et al. 2013).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Apr 2013 20:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 May 2013 15:28:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-14"}

A natural question is how to\nusefully define a domain-independent coordinate system for such a collection of\ngraphs, so that the set of possible structures can be compactly represented and\nunderstood within a common space. In this work, we draw on the theory of graph\nhomomorphisms to formulate and analyze such a representation, based on\ncomputing the frequencies of small induced subgraphs within each graph. We find\nthat the space of subgraph frequencies is governed both by its combinatorial\nproperties, based on extremal results that constrain all graphs, as well as by\nits empirical properties, manifested in the way that real social graphs appear\nto lie near a simple one-dimensional curve through this space.\n  We develop flexible frameworks for studying each of these aspects. For\ncapturing empirical properties, we characterize a simple stochastic generative\nmodel, a single-parameter extension of Erdos-Renyi random graphs, whose\nstationary distribution over subgraphs closely tracks the concentration of the\nreal social graph families. For the extremal properties, we develop a tractable\nlinear program for bounding the feasible space of subgraph frequencies by\nharnessing a toolkit of known extremal graph theory.

To\ncompare such models to observations, one must understand how to translate\nbetween surface densities observed averaging over large (~kpc) scales and\nsurface densities on the scale of individual clouds (~pc scale), which are\ntreated by models. We define a \"clumping factor\" that captures this translation\nas the ratio of the mass-weighted surface density, which is often the quantity\nof physical interest, to the area-weighted surface density, which is observed.\nWe use high spatial resolution (sub-kpc) maps of CO and HI emission from nearby\ngalaxies to measure the clumping factor of both atomic and molecular gas. The\nmolecular and atomic ISM exhibit dramatically different degrees of clumping. As\na result, the ratio H2/HI measured at ~kpc resolution cannot be trivially\ninterpreted as a cloud-scale ratio of surface densities. HI emission appears\nvery smooth, with a clumping factor of only ~1.3. Based on the scarce and\nheterogeneous high resolution data available, CO emission is far more clumped\nwith a widely variable clumping factor, median ~7 for our heterogeneous data.\nOur measurements do not provide evidence for a universal mass-weighted surface\ndensity of molecular gas, but also cannot conclusively rule out such a\nscenario. We suggest that a more sophisticated treatment of molecular ISM\nstructure, one informed by high spatial resolution CO maps, is needed to link\ncloud-scale models to kpc-scale observations of galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Apr 2013 00:01:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

Two classes of\ncompetition rules, transitive and intransitive, need to be distinguished.\nTransitive competitions are shown to be consistent (at least qualitatively)\nwith thermodynamic principles, which allows for introduction of special\ncompetitive thermodynamics. Competitive systems can thus be characterised by\nthermodynamic quantities (such as competitive entropy and competitive\npotential), which determine that the predominant direction of evolution of the\nsystem is directed towards higher competitiveness. There is, however, an\nimportant difference: while conventional thermodynamics is constrained by its\nzeroth law and is fundamentally transitive, the transitivity of competitive\nthermodynamics depends on the transitivity of the competition rules. The\nanalogy with conventional thermodynamics weakens as competitive systems become\nmore intransitive, while strongly intransitive competitions can display types\nof behaviour associated with complexity: competitive cooperation and leaping\ncycles.

We focus on\nsome indicators of star formation activity and dust attenuation for spiral\ngalaxies that have been widely used in previous work on galaxy evolution. We\nhave used 104 spiral galaxies from the CALIFA survey for which 2D spectroscopy\nwith complete spatial coverage is available. From the 3D cubes we have derived\ngrowth curves of the most conspicuous Balmer emission lines (Halpha, Hbeta) for\ncircular apertures of different radii centered at the galaxy's nucleus after\nremoving the underlying stellar continuum. We find that the Halpha flux\n(f(Halpha)) growth curve follows a well defined sequence with aperture radius\nshowing low dispersion around the median value. From this analysis, we derive\naperture corrections for galaxies in different magnitude and redshift\nintervals. Once stellar absorption is properly accounted for, the\nf(Halpha)/f(Hbeta) ratio growth curve shows a smooth decline, pointing towards\nthe absence of differential dust attenuation as a function of radius. Aperture\ncorrections as a function of the radius are provided in the interval\n[0.3,2.5]R_50. Finally, the Halpha equivalent width (EW(Halpha)) growth curve\nincreases with the size of the aperture and shows a very large dispersion for\nsmall apertures. This large dispersion prevents the use of reliable aperture\ncorrections for this quantity. In addition, this result suggests that\nseparating star-forming and quiescent galaxies based on observed EW(Halpha)\nthrough small apertures is likely to result in low EW(Halpha) star-forming\ngalaxies begin classified as quiescent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Apr 2013 08:54:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

Classical theory predicts that stellar discs are stabilized\nagainst bar formation if embedded in massive spheroidal dark matter halos.\nHowever, dark matter halos have been shown to facilitate the growth of bars\nthrough resonant gravitational interaction. Still, it remains unclear why some\ngalaxies are barred and some are not. In this study, we demonstrate that\nco-rotating (i.e., in the same sense as the disc rotating) dark matter halos\nwith spin parameters in the range of $0 \\le \\lambda_{\\mathrm{dm}} \\le 0.07$ -\nwhich are a definite prediction of modern cosmological models - promote the\nformation of bars and boxy bulges and therefore can play an important role in\nthe formation of pseudobulges in a kinematically hot dark matter dominated disc\ngalaxies.

After 2 Gyrs of evolution, the amplitude of the bar mode in a model\nwith $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{dm}} = 0.05$ is a factor of ~6 times higher, A_2/A_0 =\n0.23, than in the non-rotating halo model. After 5 Gyrs, the bar is ~ 2.5 times\nlonger. The origin of this trend is that more rapidly spinning (co-rotating)\nhalos provide a larger fraction of trailing dark matter particles that lag\nbehind the disc bar and help growing the bar by taking away its angular\nmomentum by resonant interactions. A counter-rotating halo suppresses the\nformation of a bar in our models.

However, the lack of probability aggregates, e.g. {\\em\nexpected values}, in the language of disjunctive hybrid probability logic\nprograms (DHPP) disallows the natural and concise representation of many\ninteresting problems. In this paper, we extend DHPP to allow arbitrary\nprobability aggregates. We introduce two types of probability aggregates; a\ntype that computes the expected value of a classical aggregate, e.g., the\nexpected value of the minimum, and a type that computes the probability of a\nclassical aggregate, e.g, the probability of sum of values. In addition, we\ndefine a probability answer set semantics for DHPP with arbitrary probability\naggregates including monotone, antimonotone, and nonmonotone probability\naggregates. We show that the proposed probability answer set semantics of DHPP\nsubsumes both the original probability answer set semantics of DHPP and the\nclassical answer set semantics of classical disjunctive logic programs with\nclassical aggregates, and consequently subsumes the classical answer set\nsemantics of the original disjunctive logic programs. We show that the proposed\nprobability answer sets of DHPP with probability aggregates are minimal\nprobability models and hence incomparable, which is an important property for\nnonmonotonic probability reasoning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Apr 2013 11:39:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-08"}

This is below the Eddington accretion rate\nin most UFOs, and slightly super-Eddington in extreme UFOs such as PG1211+143,\nbut ranges up to $\\sim 10-50$ times this in BAL QSOs. For UFOs this implies\nblack hole accretion rates and wind mass loss rates which are at most\ncomparable to Eddington, giving fast, highly-ionized winds. In contrast BAL QSO\nblack holes have mildly super-Eddington accretion rates, and drive winds whose\nmass loss rates are significantly super-Eddington, and so are slower and less\nionized. This picture correctly predicts the velocities and ionization states\nof the observed winds, including the recently-discovered one in SDSS\nJ1106+1939. We suggest that luminous AGN may evolve through a sequence from BAL\nQSO through LoBAL to UFO-producing Seyfert or quasar as their Eddington factors\ndrop during the decay of a bright accretion event. LoBALs correspond to a\nshort-lived stage in which the AGN radiation pressure largely evacuates the\nionization cone, but before the large-scale accretion rate has dropped to the\nEddington value. We show that sub-Eddington wind rates would produce an $M -\n\\sigma$ relation lying above that observed.

We aim to explain the nature of OGLE-2002-BLG-360 and its eruption\nobserved in 2002--2006. The observational data primarily come from the archives\nof the OGLE project, which monitored the object in 2001--2009. The archives of\nthe MACHO and MOA projects also provided us with additional data obtained in\n1995--99 and 2000--2005, respectively. These data allowed us to analyse the\nlight curve of the object during its eruption, as well as the potential\nvariability of its progenitor. In the archives of several infrared surveys,\nnamely 2MASS, MSX, Spitzer, AKARI, WISE, and VVV, we found measurements of the\nobject, which allowed us to study the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the\nobject. We constructed a simple model of a star surrounded by a dusty envelope,\nwhich was used to interpret the observed SED. Our analysis of the data clearly\nshows that OGLE-2002-BLG-360 was most probably a red transient, i.e. an object\nsimilar in nature to V838 Mon, whose eruption was observed in 2002. The SED in\nall phases, i.e. progenitor, eruption, and remnant, was dominated by infrared\nemission, which we interpret as evidence of dust formation in an intense mass\noutflow. Since 2009 the object has been completely embedded in dust. We suggest\nthat the progenitor of OGLE-2002-BLG-360 was a binary, which had entered the\ncommon-envelope phase a long time (at least decades) before the observed\neruption, and that the eruption resulted from the final merger of the binary\ncomponents. We point out similarities between OGLE-2002-BLG-360 and CK Vul,\nwhose eruption was observed in 1670--72, and this strengthens the hypothesis\nthat CK Vul was also a red transient.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Apr 2013 12:30:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Apr 2013 07:44:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 16 May 2013 10:39:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

In this paper,\nwe propose a new method for processing RNA-seq data that yields gene expression\nestimates that are much more similar to corresponding estimates from microarray\ndata, hence greatly improving cross-platform comparability.

In an experiment to retrieve paired microarray\nsamples from a database using an RNA-seq query sample, gene signatures defined\nbased on PREBS expression estimates were found to be much more accurate than\nthose from other methods.

This function rapidly tends to zero as $x\\to+\\infty$ and to some positive\nconstant c as $x\\to-\\infty$. In 1989 E. Khruslov and V. Kotlyarov have found\nthat for a large time the solution breaks up into a train of asymptotic\nsolitons located in the domain $4c^2t-C_N \\ln t<x\\leq4c^2t$ ($C_N$ is a\nconstant). The number N of these solitons grows unboundedly as $t\\to\\infty$. In\n2010 V. Kotlyarov and A. Minakov have studied temporary asymptotics of the\nsolution of the Cauchy problem on the whole line and have found that in the\ndomain $-6c^2 t<x<4c^2t$ this solution is described by a modulated elliptic\nwave. We considere here the modulated elliptic wave in the domain $4c^2t-C_N\n\\ln t<x<4c^2t$. Our main result shows that the modulated elliptic wave also\nbreaks up into solitons, which are similar to the asymptotic solitons, but\ndiffer from them in phase. It means that the modulated elliptic wave does not\nrepresent the asymptotics of the solution in the domain $4c^2t-C_N \\ln\nt<x<4c^2t$. The correct asymptotic behavior of the solution is given by the\ntrain of asymptotic solitons.

One of them is the\nasymptotic soliton while the other soliton is generated from the elliptic wave.\nTheir phases become closer to each other for a large N, i.e. these solitons are\nalso close to each other. This result gives the answer on a very important\nquestion about matching of the asymptotic formulas in the mentioned region\nwhere the both formulas are well-defined.

Nevertheless, most astrophysical studies are based on the\nroom-temperature optical constants of solids, such as corundum and spinel. A\nmore realistic approach is needed for these materials, especially in the\ncontext of modeling late-type stars. We aimed at deriving sets of optical\nconstants of selected, astrophysically relevant oxide dust species with high\nmelting points. A high-temperature-high-pressure-cell and a Fourier-transform\nspectrometer were used to measure reflectance spectra of polished samples. For\ncorundum (alpha-Al$_2$O$_3$), spinel (MgAl$_2$O$_4$), and alpha-quartz\n(SiO$_2$), temperature-dependent optical constants were measured from 300 K up\nto more than 900 K. Small particle spectra were also calculated from these\ndata. All three examined oxides show a significant temperature dependence of\ntheir mid-IR bands. For the case of corundum, we find that the 13$\\mu$m\nemission feature - seen in the IR spectra of many AGB stars - can very well be\nassigned to this mineral species. The best fit of the feature is achieved with\noblate corundum grains at mean temperatures around 550 K. Spinel remains a\nviable carrier of the 13$\\mu$m feature as well, but only for T < 300 K and\nnearly spherical grain shapes. Under such circumstances, spinel grains may also\naccount for the 31.8$\\mu$m band that is frequently seen in sources of the\n13$\\mu$m feature and which has not yet been identified with certainty.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Apr 2013 14:07:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-08"}

Transition disks typically appear in resolved millimeter\nobservations as giant dust rings surrounding their young host stars. More\naccurate observations with ALMA have shown several of these rings to be in fact\nasymmetric: they have lopsided shapes. It has been speculated that these rings\nact as dust traps, which would make them important laboratories for studying\nplanet formation. It has been shown that an elongated giant vortex produced in\na disk with a strong viscosity jump strikingly resembles the observed\nasymmetric rings.\n  Aims. We aim to study a similar behavior for a disk in which a giant planet\nis embedded. However, a giant planet can induce two kinds of asymmetries: (1) a\ngiant vortex, and (2) an eccentric disk. We studied under which conditions each\nof these can appear, and how one can observationally distinguish between them.\nThis is important because only a vortex can trap particles both radially and\nazimuthally, while the eccentric ring can only trap particles in radial\ndirection.\n  Methods. We used the FARGO code to conduct the hydro-simulations. We set up a\ndisk with an embedded giant planet and took a radial grid spanning from 0.1 to\n7 times the planet semi-major axis. We ran the simulations with various\nviscosity values and planet masses for 1000 planet orbits to allow a fully\ndeveloped vortex or disk eccentricity. Afterwards, we compared the dust\ndistribution in a vortex-holding disk with an eccentric disk using dust\nsimulations.\n  Results. We find that vorticity and eccentricity are distinguishable by\nlooking at the azimuthal contrast of the dust density. While vortices, as\nparticle traps, produce very pronounced azimuthal asymmetries, eccentric\nfeatures are not able to accumulate millimeter dust particles in azimuthal\ndirection, and therefore the asymmetries are expected to be modest.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Apr 2013 14:50:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

To investigate this system at higher densities, we construct and study\na conserved-particle-number contact process with novel three-body interactions,\nwhich are potentially more likely than two-body interactions at higher\ndensities. For example, consider one active (diffusing) particle colliding with\ntwo inactive (non-diffusing) particles such that they become active, in\naddition to spontaneous inactivation.

To find the\nground states, the conformational energy is computed as a sum of the bending\nand torsional elastic components and the effective self-attraction energy. The\nmodel includes a relative orientation or sequence dependence of the effective\nattraction forces between different pieces of the polymer chain. Two series of\nconformations are analysed: a multicovered circle (a toroid) and a multifold\ntwo-headed racquet. The results are presented as a diagram of state. It is\nsuggested that the stability of particular conformations may be controlled by\nproper adjustment of the primary structure. Application of the model to other\nsemi-flexible polymers is considered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Apr 2013 15:35:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-25"}

The transition is manifested by the supression of time-dependent\nentanglement oscillations which are superimposed on the slowly varying\nentanglement decay related to phase decoherence (which result in oscillatory\nbehaviour of entanglement sudden death time as a function of the magnetic\nfield).
