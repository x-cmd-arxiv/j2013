In [BKR], we have constructed canonical trace maps Tr_n(A): HC(A)\n-> H[DRep_n(A)]^GL extending the usual characters of representations to higher\ncyclic homology. This raises a question whether a well known theorem of Procesi\n[P] holds in the derived setting: namely, is the algebra homomorphism\nSym[Tr_n(A)]: Sym[HC(A)] -> H[DRep_n(A)]^GL defined by Tr_n(A) surjective ? In\nthe present paper, we answer this question for augmented algebras. Given such\nan algebra, we construct a canonical dense DG subalgebra DRep_\\infty(A)^Tr of\nthe topological DG algebra DRep_\\infty(A)^{GL_\\infty}. It turns out that on\npassing to the inverse limit (as n -> \\infty), the family of maps Sym[Tr_n(A)]\n\"stabilizes\" to an isomorphism Sym[\\bar{HC}(A)] = H[DRep_\\infty(A)^Tr]. The\nderived version of Procesi's theorem does therefore hold in the limit. However,\nfor a fixed (finite) n, there exist homological obstructions to the\nsurjectivity of Sym[Tr_n(A)], and we show on simple examples that these\nobstructions do not vanish in general. We compare our result with the classical\ntheorem of Loday-Quillen and Tsygan on stable homology of matrix Lie algebras.\nWe show that the relative Chevalley-Eilenberg complex C(gl_\\infty(A),\ngl_\\infty(k); k) equipped with the natural coalgebra structure is Koszul dual\nto the DG algebra DRep_\\infty(A)^Tr. We also extend our main results to\nbigraded DG algebras, in which case we show that DRep_{\\infty}(A)^Tr =\nDRep_{\\infty}(A)^GL_{\\infty}. As an application, we compute the (bigraded)\nEuler characteristics of DRep_\\infty(A)^GL_{\\infty} and \\bar{HC}(A) and derive\nsome interesting combinatorial identities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Apr 2013 16:03:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 21 Apr 2013 18:50:29 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 11 Feb 2014 18:08:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-21"}

It has been proposed that the temporal coincidence of a gamma-ray\nburst (GRB) and a type Ib/c supernova (SN) can be explained with the concept of\ninduced gravitational collapse (IGC), induced by the matter ejected from an SN\nIb/c accreting onto a neutron star (NS). The NS is expected to reach the\ncritical mass necessary for it to collapse to a black hole (BH) and emit a GRB.\nWe found a standard luminosity light curve behavior in the late-time X-ray\nemission of this subclass of GRBs. Aims. We test if this standard behavior in\nthe luminosity found in this subclass of GRBs can become a redshift estimator\nof these sources. Methods. We selected a sample of GRBs that belong to this\nsubclass of IGC GRBs associated to an SN (IGC GRB-SN sources). These sources\nhave an isotropic energy $E_{iso} > 10^{52}$ erg and their cosmological\nredshifts are in the range of $z = 0.49-1.261$. We focused on the corresponding\nX-ray luminosity light curves. Results. We find that all GRBs of the sample\nwith measured redshift present a standard luminosity late-time light curve in\nthe $0.3-10$ keV rest-frame energy range. We used these results to estimate the\nGRB redshift of the sample without a measured redshift and found results\nconsistent with other possible redshift indicators. Conclusions. The standard\nlate-time X-ray luminosity light curve of all GRBs of the sample shows a common\nphysical mechanism in this particular phase of the X-ray emission, possibly\nrelated to the creation of the NS from the SN process. This scaling law\nmoreover represents strong evidence of very low or even absent beaming in this\nlate phase of the X-ray afterglow emission process. This could be a fundamental\ntool for estimating the redshift of GRBs that belong to this subclass of\nevents. We are currently expanding this subclass of GRBs to further verify the\nuniversal validity of this new redshift estimation method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Apr 2013 17:02:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-08"}

In order to extract an economically useful amount of\npower, hundreds of tidal turbines must typically be deployed in an array. This\nnaturally leads to the question of how these turbines should be configured to\nextract the maximum possible power: the positioning and the individual tuning\nof the turbines could significantly influence the extracted power, and hence is\nof major economic interest. However, manual optimisation is difficult due to\nlegal site constraints, nonlinear interactions of the turbine wakes, and the\ncubic dependence of the power on the flow speed. The novel contribution of this\npaper is the formulation of this problem as an optimisation problem constrained\nby a physical model, which is then solved using an efficient gradient-based\noptimisation algorithm. In each optimisation iteration, a two-dimensional\nfinite element shallow water model predicts the flow and the performance of the\ncurrent array configuration. The gradient of the power extracted with respect\nto the turbine positions and their tuning parameters is then computed in a\nfraction of the time taken for a flow solution by solving the associated\nadjoint equations. These equations propagate causality backwards through the\ncomputation, from the power extracted back to the turbine positions and the\ntuning parameters. This yields the gradient at a cost almost independent of the\nnumber of turbines, which is crucial for any practical application. The utility\nof the approach is demonstrated by optimising turbine arrays in four idealised\nscenarios and a more realistic case with up to 256 turbines in the Inner Sound\nof the Pentland Firth, Scotland.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Apr 2013 17:20:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 12 Oct 2013 18:48:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-15"}

When this\nextremely cold brine leaves the ice it freezes the water it comes into contact\nwith; a hollow tube of ice --- a brinicle --- growing downwards around the\nplume of descending brine. We show that brinicles can be understood as a form\nof the self-assembled tubular precipitation structures termed chemical gardens,\nplant-like structures formed on placing together a soluble metal salt, often in\nthe form of a seed crystal, and an aqueous solution of one of many anions,\noften silicate. On one hand, in the case of classical chemical gardens, an\nosmotic pressure difference across a semipermeable precipitation membrane that\nfilters solutions by rejecting the solute leads to an inflow of water and to\nits rupture. The internal solution, generally being lighter than the external\nsolution, flows up through the break, and as it does so a tube grows upwards by\nprecipitation around the jet of internal solution. Such chemical-garden tubes\ncan grow to many centimetres in length. In the case of brinicles, on the other\nhand, in floating sea ice we have porous ice in a mushy layer that filters out\nwater, by freezing it, and allows concentrated brine through. Again there is an\nosmotic pressure difference leading to a continuing ingress of sea water in a\nsiphon pump mechanism that is sustained as long as the ice continues to freeze.\nSince the brine that is pumped out is denser than the sea water, and descends\nrather rises, a brinicle is a downwards growing tube of ice; an inverse\nchemical garden.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Apr 2013 17:58:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

It\nhas been shown and demonstrated experimentally that patterning a grating\nprofile within a multilayer structure leads to a diffractive optics with\nimproved resolving power. We illustrate the use of a Mo/B4C multilayer grating\nin the Fe L and C K spectral ranges, around 700 eV and 280 eV respectively.\nFirst, in the Fe L range, the improved spectral resolution enables us to\ndistinguish the Fe L\\alpha and L\\beta emissions (separated by 13 eV). In\naddition, using a sample made of a mix of LiF and an iron ore, we show that it\nis possible to easily resolve the F K and Fe L emissions.

Second, in the C K range, by comparing C K\\alpha spectra\nfrom B4C and cellulose, we show that the shape of the emission band is\nsensitive to the chemical state of the carbon atom.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Apr 2013 18:08:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-08"}

A\nleading explanation for the rising positron fraction is an additional source of\nelectron-positron pairs, for example one or more mature, energetic, and\nrelatively nearby pulsars. We point out that any one of two well-known nearby\npulsars, Geminga and Monogem, can satisfactorily provide enough positrons to\nreproduce AMS-02 observations.

We show that in the theories of\ninterest for electroweak symmetry breaking that have a holographic dual, the\npresence of a light radion in the spectrum is not a robust prediction of the\nframework, but is in fact associated with mild tuning. We find that corrections\nto the form of the radion couplings to Standard Model particles arising from\neffects associated with brane stabilization are suppressed by the square of the\nratio of the radion mass to the Kaluza-Klein scale. These corrections are small\nin theories where the radion is light, and are generally subleading, except in\nthe case of couplings to the SM gluons and photon, when they can sometimes\ndominate. The AdS/CFT correspondence relates the radion in Randall-Sundrum\nmodels to the dilaton in theories where a strongly coupled conformal symmetry\nis spontaneously broken. We show that the discrepancies in the literature\nbetween the results for the dilaton and the radion can be traced to the\nomission of self-interaction terms that would otherwise dominate the potential\nfor the Goldberger-Wise scalar near the infrared brane.

Reductions from set disjointness are a canonical way of proving\nlower bounds in data stream algorithms, data structures, and distributed\ncomputation. In these applications, often the set sizes $|S|$ and $|T|$ are\nbounded by a value $k$ which is much smaller than $n$. This is referred to as\nsmall set disjointness. A major restriction in the above applications is the\nnumber of rounds that the protocol can make, which, e.g., translates to the\nnumber of passes in streaming applications. A fundamental question is thus in\nunderstanding the round complexity of the small set disjointness problem. For\nan essentially equivalent problem, called OR-Equality, Brody et. al showed that\nwith $r$ rounds of communication, the randomized communication complexity is\n$\\Omega(k \\ilog^r k)$, where$\\ilog^r k$ denotes the $r$-th iterated logarithm\nfunction.

We abstract from utility, bequest and consumption preference\nissues by treating the VA as liquid and tradable. This allows us to use an\nAmerican option pricing framework to derive a so-called optimal initiation\nregion. Our main practical finding is that given current design parameters in\nwhich volatility (asset allocation) is restricted to less than 20%, while\nguaranteed payout rates (GPR) as well as bonus (roll-up) rates are less than\n5%, GLWBs that are in-the-money should be turned on by the late 50s and\ncertainly the early 60s. The exception to the rule is when a non-constant GPR\nis about to increase (soon) to a higher age band, in which case the optimal\npolicy is to wait until the new GPR is hit and then initiate immediately. Also,\nto offer a different perspective, we invert the model and solve for the bonus\n(roll-up) rate that is required to justify delaying initiation at any age. We\nfind that the required bonus is quite high and more than what is currently\npromised by existing products.

A particular interesting region of 1.1Mb (with average\ndosage 1.95) locates on Chromosome 2p23 that harbors two genes, PXDN and MYT1L,\nboth of which are associated with autism and schizophrenia. In light of the low\nprevalence of autism in Hispanics, this region warrants special attention. We\nconfirmed our findings using Mexican samples from the 1000 genomes project.

Parakeet dynamically compiles whole user functions to high performance\nmulti-threaded native code. Parakeet makes extensive use of the classic data\nparallel operators Map, Reduce, and Scan. We introduce a new set of data\nparallel operators,TiledMap, TiledReduce, and TiledScan, that break up their\ncomputations into local pieces of bounded size so as better to make use of\nsmall fast memories. We introduce a novel tiling transformation to generate\ntiled operators automatically. Applying this transformation once tiles the\nprogram for cache, and applying it again enables tiling for registers. The\nsizes for cache tiles are left unspecified until runtime, when an autotuning\nsearch is performed. Finally, we evaluate our optimizations on benchmarks and\nshow significant speedups on programs that exhibit data locality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Apr 2013 23:52:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-09"}

The derived shear estimator disposes with the\nassignment of ellipticities to individual galaxies that is typical of previous\napproaches to galaxy lensing. Shear estimates from the mean of the Bayesian\nposterior are unbiased in the limit of large number of background galaxies,\nregardless of the noise level on individual galaxies. The Bayesian formalism\nrequires a prior describing the (noiseless) distribution of the target galaxy\npopulation over some parameter space; this prior can be constructed from\nlow-noise images of a subsample of the target population, attainable from long\nintegrations of a fraction of the survey field. We find two ways to combine\nthis exact treatment of noise with rigorous treatment of the effects of the\ninstrumental point-spread function and sampling. The Bayesian model fitting\n(BMF) method assigns a likelihood of the pixel data to galaxy models (e.g.\nSersic ellipses). The Bayesian Fourier domain (BFD) method compresses the pixel\ndata to a small set of weighted moments calculated after PSF correction in\nFourier space. A numerical test using a simplified model of a biased galaxy\nmeasurement process demonstrates that the Bayesian formalism recovers applied\nshears to $<1$ part in $10^3$ accuracy and provides accurate uncertainty\nestimates. BFD is the first shear measurement algorithm that is model-free and\nrequires no approximations or ad hoc assumptions in correcting for the effects\nof PSF, noise, or sampling on the galaxy images. These algorithms are good\ncandidates for attaining the part-per-thousand shear inference required for\nhemisphere-scale weak gravitational lensing surveys.

Finding\nthese notions to be somewhat opaque, some authors have recommended\nreformulating Fisher's ideas in terms of covariance and regression, which are\nclassical concepts of statistics. We argue that Fisher intended his two\naverages to express a distinction between correlation and causation. On this\nview the average effect is a specific weighted average of the actual phenotypic\nchanges that result from physically changing the allelic states of homologous\ngenes. We show that the statistical and causal conceptions of the average\neffect, perceived as inconsistent by Falconer, can be reconciled if certain\nrelationships between the genotype frequencies and non-additive residuals are\nconserved. There are certain theory-internal considerations favoring Fisher's\noriginal formulation in terms of causality; for example, the frequency-weighted\nmean of the average effects equaling zero at each locus becomes a derivable\nconsequence rather than an arbitrary constraint. More broadly, Fisher's\ndistinction between correlation and causation is of critical importance to\ngene-trait mapping studies and the foundations of evolutionary biology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Apr 2013 02:42:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-14"}

For example, the network induced by a cascade may have a heavy-tailed\ndegree distribution even if the original network does not.\n  This provides evidence that online social networks created by technology\nadoption over an underlying social network may look fundamentally different\nfrom social networks and indicates that using data from many online social\nnetworks may mislead us if we try to use it to directly infer the structure of\nsocial networks. Our results provide an alternate explanation for certain\nproperties repeatedly observed in data sets, for example: heavy-tailed degree\ndistribution, network densification, shrinking diameter, and network community\nprofile. These properties could be caused by a sort of `sampling bias' rather\nthan by attributes of the underlying social structure.

These differences coupled with environmental\nfluctuations in demographic rates can have subtle effects on population\npersistence and species coexistence. To understand these effects, we provide a\ngeneral theory for coexistence of structured, interacting species living in a\nstochastic environment. The theory is applicable to nonlinear, multi species\nmatrix models with stochastically varying parameters. The theory relies on\nlong-term growth rates of species corresponding to the dominant Lyapunov\nexponents of random matrix products. Our coexistence criterion requires that a\nconvex combination of these long-term growth rates is positive with probability\none whenever one or more species are at low density. When this condition holds,\nthe community is stochastically persistent: the fraction of time that a species\ndensity goes below $\\delta>0$ approaches zero as $\\delta$ approaches zero.\nApplications to predator-prey interactions in an autocorrelated environment, a\nstochastic LPA model, and spatial lottery models are provided. These\napplications demonstrate that positive autocorrelations in temporal\nfluctuations can disrupt predator-prey coexistence, fluctuations in\nlog-fecundity can facilitate persistence in structured populations, and\nlong-lived, relatively sedentary competing populations are likely to coexist in\nspatially and temporally heterogenous environments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Apr 2013 07:32:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 2 Nov 2013 01:46:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-16"}

However, SSDs suffer from bit errors, and the bit error rate is time\ndependent since it increases as an SSD wears down. Traditional storage systems\nmainly use parity-based RAID to provide reliability guarantees by striping\nredundancy across multiple devices, but the effectiveness of RAID in SSDs\nremains debatable as parity updates aggravate the wearing and bit error rates\nof SSDs. In particular, an open problem is that how different parity\ndistributions over multiple devices, such as the even distribution suggested by\nconventional wisdom, or uneven distributions proposed in recent RAID schemes\nfor SSDs, may influence the reliability of an SSD RAID array. To address this\nfundamental problem, we propose the first analytical model to quantify the\nreliability dynamics of an SSD RAID array. Specifically, we develop a\n\"non-homogeneous\" continuous time Markov chain model, and derive the transient\nreliability solution. We validate our model via trace-driven simulations and\nconduct numerical analysis to provide insights into the reliability dynamics of\nSSD RAID arrays under different parity distributions and subject to different\nbit error rates and array configurations. Designers can use our model to decide\nthe appropriate parity distribution based on their reliability requirements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Apr 2013 07:48:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-09"}

This phenomenon occurs due to the fact that the\nsupercurrent is carried by helical Andreev bound states (ABSs) characterized by\nspin-momentum locking similar to the normal-state carriers. We derive the\nspectrum of the helical ABSs and the corresponding Josephson current for a\njunction made on the surface of a three-dimensional TI. The superconducting\nKlein tunneling is predicted to yield a non-sinusoidal current-phase relation\nand an anomalous critical current $I_c$ that does not vanish with increasing\nbarrier strength. We also analyze the dependence of the I_cR_n product (where\nR_n is the normal-state junction resistance) on the microscopic parameters of\nthe superconductor/TI interface, which leads to lower I_cR_n values than\nexpected from previous models of the proximity-effect Josephson junctions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Apr 2013 14:09:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 3 Aug 2013 10:44:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-06"}

Thus, the final state results to be a pure quantum state\ninstead of a mixed one. Hence, Hawking's claim is falsified because BHs result\nto be well defined quantum mechanical systems, having ordered, discrete quantum\nspectra, which respect 't Hooft's assumption that Schr\\\"oedinger equations can\nbe used universally for all dynamics in the universe.
