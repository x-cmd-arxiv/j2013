We confirm the\npresence of three distinct drift modes (A,B,C) plus a disordered mode (N) and\nshow that they follow one another in specific cycles. Interpreting the pulsar's\nprofile as resulting from a sightline traverse which cuts across an outer cone\nand tangentially grazes an inner cone, we demonstrate that the phase modulation\nof the inner cone is locked to the amplitude modulation of the outer cone in\nall the drift modes. The 9% nulls are found to be largely confined to the\ndominant B and N modes, and, in the N mode, create alternating bunches of nulls\nand emission in a quasi-periodic manner with an averaged fluctuation rate of\nabout 12 rotation periods ($P_1$). We explore the assumption that the apparent\ndrift is the first alias of a faster drift of subbeams equally spaced around\nthe cones. This is shown to imply that all modes A, B and C have a common\ncirculation time of 12 $P_1$ and differ only in the number of subbeams. This\ntimescale is on the same order as predicted by the classic {\\bf E}$\\times${\\bf\nB} drift and also coincides with the N-mode modulation. We therefore arrive at\na picture where the circulation speed remains roughly invariant while the\nsubbeams progressively diminish in number from modes A to B to C, and are then\nre-established during the N mode. We suggest that aliasing combined with\nsubbeam loss may be responsible for apparently dramatic changes in drift rates\nin other pulsars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Apr 2013 16:05:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

For development of spectral CT with\nenergy-discriminative photon-counting (EDPC) detectors, here we propose and\nevaluate a dynamic bowtie for performance optimization based on a patient model\nor a scout scan. Our dynamic bowtie modifies an x-ray beam intensity profile by\nmechanical rotation and adaptive adjustment of the x-ray source flux. First, a\nmathematical model for dynamic bowtie filtering is established for an\nelliptical section in fan-beam geometry, and the contour of the optimal bowtie\nis derived. Then, numerical simulation is performed to compare the performance\nof the dynamic bowtie in the cases of an ideal phantom and a realistic\ncross-section relative to the counterparts without any bowtie and with a fixed\nbowtie respectively. Our dynamic bowtie can equalize the expected numbers of\nphotons in the case of an ideal phantom. In practical cases, our dynamic bowtie\ncan effectively reduce the dynamic range of detected signals inside the field\nof view. Although our design is optimized for an elliptical phantom, the\nresultant dynamic bowtie can be applied to a real fan-beam scan if the\nunderlying cross-section can be approximated as an ellipse. Furthermore, our\ndesign methodology can be applied to specify an optimized dynamic bowtie for\nany cross-section of a patient, preferably using rapid prototyping technology.\nThis fan-beam dynamic bowtie work could be extended to the cone-beam geometry\nin a follow-up study.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Apr 2013 16:26:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-30"}

Such a non-stationary environment\nemerges when large-scale failures occur at power distribution networks due to\nexternal disturbances such as hurricanes and severe storms. Power distribution\nnetworks lie at the edge of the grid, and are especially vulnerable to external\ndisruptions. Quantifiable approaches are lacking and needed to learn\nnon-stationary behaviors of large-scale failure and recovery of power\ndistribution. This work studies such non-stationary behaviors in three aspects.\nFirst, a novel formulation is derived for an entire life cycle of large-scale\nfailure and recovery of power distribution. Second, spatial-temporal models of\nfailure and recovery of power distribution are developed as geo-location based\nmultivariate non-stationary GI(t)/G(t)/Infinity queues. Third, the\nnon-stationary spatial-temporal models identify a small number of parameters to\nbe learned. Learning is applied to two real-life examples of large-scale\ndisruptions.

Ultrasound images and infrared images have similar cluttered\nappearance, that make 1 dimensional structures, as edges and object boundaries\ndifficult to locate. Structure information is usually extracted in two steps:\nfirst, building and edge strength mask classifying pixels as edge points by\nhypothesis testing, and secondly estimating from that mask, pixel wide\nconnected edges. With constant false alarm rate (CFAR) edge strength detectors\nfor speckle clutter, the image needs to be scanned by a sliding window composed\nof several differently oriented splitting sub-windows.

Moreover, its potential virtues grow in complex settings where\nincentive compatible auctions may generate little or no revenue. Unfortunately,\nthe first-price auction is poorly understood in theory because equilibrium is\nnot {\\em a priori} a credible predictor of bidder behavior.\n  We take a dynamic approach to studying first-price auctions: rather than\nbasing performance guarantees solely on static equilibria, we study the\nrepeated setting and show that robust performance guarantees may be derived\nfrom simple axioms of bidder behavior. For example, as long as a loser raises\nher bid quickly, a standard first-price auction will generate at least as much\nrevenue as a second-price auction. We generalize this dynamic technique to\ncomplex pay-your-bid auction settings and show that progressively stronger\nassumptions about bidder behavior imply progressively stronger guarantees about\nthe auction's performance.\n  Along the way, we find that the auctioneer's choice of bidding language is\ncritical when generalizing beyond the single-item setting, and we propose a\nspecific construction called the {\\em utility-target auction} that performs\nwell. The utility-target auction includes a bidder's final utility as an\nadditional parameter, identifying the single dimension along which she wishes\nto compete. This auction is closely related to profit-target bidding in\nfirst-price and ascending proxy package auctions and gives strong revenue\nguarantees for a variety of complex auction environments. Of particular\ninterest, the guaranteed existence of a pure-strategy equilibrium in the\nutility-target auction shows how Overture might have eliminated the cyclic\nbehavior in their generalized first-price sponsored search auction if bidders\ncould have placed more sophisticated bids.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Apr 2013 17:31:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-30"}

Therefore, one can interpret the complex phase\ndiagrams of magnetoelectrics as induced by a single IR either of the praphase\nor of the symmetry group of the exchange Hamiltonian. Detailed\ntemperature-magnetic field phase diagrams of MnWO4 and CuO for certain field\ndirections are obtained and the magnetic structures of the field-induced phases\nare determined.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Apr 2013 18:19:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 Dec 2013 19:43:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-20"}

We find large velocity dispersions in the\nlines, sigma=30-250 km/s. Our data agree well with simulations where we applied\nbeam-smearing and assumed a scaling relation of the form: velocity dispersion\nis proportional to the square root of the star-formation intensity\n(star-formation rate per unit area). We conclude that the dispersions are\nprimarily driven by star formation. To explain the high surface brightness and\noptical line ratios, high thermal pressures in the warm ionized medium, WIM,\nare required (log P/k (K/cm^3)>~6-7). Such thermal pressures in the WIM are\nsimilar to those observed in nearby starburst galaxies, but occur over much\nlarger physical scales. Moreover, the relatively low ionization parameters\nnecessary to fit the high surface brightnesses and optical line ratios suggest\nthat the gas is not only directly associated with regions of star formation,\nbut is wide spread throughout the general ISM. Thus the optical emission line\ngas is a tracer of the large scale dynamics of the bulk of the ISM. We present\na simple model for the energy input from young stars in an accreting galaxy, to\nargue that the intense star-formation is supporting high turbulent pressure,\nwhich roughly balances the gravitational pressure and thus enables distant gas\naccreting disks to maintain a Toomre disk instability parameter Q~1. For a star\nformation efficiency of 3%, only 5-15% of the mechanical energy from young\nstars that is deposited in the ISM is needed to support the level of turbulence\nrequired for maintaining this balance. Since this balance is maintained by\nenergy injected into the ISM by the young stars themselves, this suggests that\nstar formation in high redshift galaxies is self-regulating.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Apr 2013 18:33:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

In pure N=4 supergravity, this anomalous symmetry still implies\nduality invariance of candidate counterterms at three loops. Provided one makes\nthe additional assumption that there exists a full 16-supercharge off-shell\nformulation of the theory, counterterms at L>1 loops would also have to be\nwritable as full-superspace integrals.

The Galactic Observations of\nTerahertz C+ (GOTC+) project surveys the [CII] line over the entire Galactic\ndisk with velocity-resolved observations using the Herschel/HIFI instrument. We\npresent the first longitude-velocity maps of the [CII] emission for Galactic\nlatitudes b=0deg, +-0.5deg, and +-1.0deg. [CII] emission is mostly associated\nwith spiral arms, mainly emerging from Galactocentric distances between 4 and\n10 kpc. We estimate that most of the observed [CII] emission is produced by\ndense PDRs (47%), with smaller contributions from CO-dark H2 gas (28%), cold\natomic gas (21%), and ionized gas (4%). Atomic gas inside the Solar radius is\nmostly in the form of cold neutral medium (CNM), while the warm neutral medium\n(WNM) gas dominates the outer galaxy. The average fraction of CNM relative to\ntotal atomic gas is 43%. We find that the warm and diffuse CO-dark H2 is\ndistributed over a larger range of Galactocentric distances (4-11 kpc) than the\ncold and dense H2 gas traced by 12CO and 13CO (4-8kpc). The fraction of CO-dark\nH2 to total H2 increases with Galactocentric distance, ranging from 20% at 4\nkpc to 80% at 10 kpc. On average, CO-dark H2 accounts for 30% of the molecular\nmass of the Milky Way. When the CO-dark H2 component is included, the radial\ndistribution of the CO-to-H2 conversion factor is steeper than that when only\nmolecular gas traced by CO is considered. Most of the observed [CII] emission\nemerging from dense PDRs is associated with modest far-ultraviolet fields in\nthe range chi0~1-30.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Apr 2013 20:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 May 2013 21:29:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 29 May 2013 17:57:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

Applying an effective action approach, the most\ngeneral form of the free energy quadratic in the extrinsic curvature and\nextrinsic twist potential of stationary fluid brane configurations is\nconstructed to second order in a derivative expansion. This construction\ngeneralizes the Helfrich-Canham bending energy for fluid membranes studied in\ntheoretical biology to the case in which the fluid is rotating. It is found\nthat stationary fluid brane configurations are characterized by a set of 3\nelastic response coefficients, 3 hydrodynamic response coefficients and 1 spin\nresponse coefficient for co-dimension greater than one. Moreover, the elastic\ndegrees of freedom present in the system are coupled to the hydrodynamic\ndegrees of freedom. For co-dimension-1 surfaces we find a 8 independent\nparameter family of stationary fluid branes.

This is a good\napproximation for processes when ionic concentrations vary little during the\ntime course of a simulation. During periods of intense neural signalling,\nhowever, the local extracellular K+ concentration may increase by several\nmillimolars. Clearance of excess K+ likely depends partly on diffusion in the\nextracellular space, partly on local uptake by- and intracellular transport\nwithin astrocytes. This process takes place at the time scale of seconds, and\ncan not be modeled accurately without accounting for the spatiotemporal\nvariations in ion concentrations. The work presented here consists of two main\nparts: First, we developed a general electrodiffusive formalism for modeling\nion concentration dynamics in a one-dimensional geometry, including both an\nintra- and extracellular domain. The formalism was based on the Nernst-Planck\nequations. It ensures (i) consistency between the membrane potential and ion\nconcentrations, (ii) global particle/charge conservation, and (iii) accounts\nfor diffusion and concentration dependent variations in resistivities. Second,\nwe applied the formalism to model how astrocytes exchange ions with the ECS,\nand identified the key astrocytic mechanisms involved in K+ removal from high\nconcentration regions. We found that a local increase in extracellular\nK\\textsuperscript{+} evoked a local depolarization of the astrocyte membrane,\nwhich at the same time (i) increased the local astrocytic uptake of\nK\\textsuperscript{+}, (ii) suppressed extracellular transport of K+, (iii)\nincreased transport of K+ within astrocytes, and (iv) facilitated astrocytic\nrelase of K+ in extracellular low concentration regions.

However, vortex formation is\nsuppressed in strongly self-gravitating disks and replaced by a global spiral\ninstability associated with the gap edge which develops during gap formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Apr 2013 20:03:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-01"}

This\ntheorem may be tested observationally by using electromagnetic or\ngravitational-wave observations to map the spacetime around a candidate black\nhole and measure potential deviations from the Kerr metric. Several parametric\nframeworks have been constructed for tests of the no-hair theorem. Due to the\nuniqueness of the Kerr metric, any such parametric framework must violate at\nleast one of the assumptions of the no-hair theorem. This can lead to\npathologies in the spacetime, such as closed timelike curves or singularities,\nwhich may hamper using the metric in the strong-field regime.

Instead of executing each application one by one, using\na maximum degree of parallelism for each of them, we aim at scheduling several\napplications concurrently.

A pack comprises several\napplications, each of them with an assigned number of processors, with the\nconstraint that the total number of processors assigned within a pack does not\nexceed the maximum number of available processors. The objective is to\ndetermine a partition into packs, and an assignment of processors to\napplications, that minimize the sum of the execution times of the packs. We\nthoroughly study the complexity of this optimization problem, and propose\nseveral heuristics that exhibit very good performance on a variety of\nworkloads, whose application execution times model profiles of parallel\nscientific codes.

For\nthe first time, this library provides the rate probability density at all\ntemperature grid points for convenient implementation in models of stellar\nphenomena. The recommended rate and its associated uncertainties are also\nincluded. Currently, uncertainties are absent from all other rate libraries,\nand, although estimates have been attempted in previous evaluations and\ncompilations, these are generally not based on rigorous statistical\ndefinitions. A common standard for deriving uncertainties is clearly warranted.\nSTARLIB represents a first step in addressing this deficiency by providing a\ntabular, up-to-date database that supplies not only the rate and its\nuncertainty but also its distribution. Because a majority of rates are\nlognormally distributed, this allows the construction of rate probability\ndensities from the columns of STARLIB. This structure is based on a recently\nsuggested Monte Carlo method to calculate reaction rates, where uncertainties\nare rigorously defined. In STARLIB, experimental rates are supplemented with:\n(i) theoretical TALYS rates for reactions for which no experimental input is\navailable, and (ii) laboratory and theoretical weak rates. STARLIB includes all\ntypes of reactions of astrophysical interest to Z = 83, such as (p,g), (p,a),\n(a,n), and corresponding reverse rates. Strong rates account for thermal target\nexcitations.

This paper studies a\ndifferent but fundamentally important aspect of this problem: uncertainty\nquantification for parameter estimates and model choices. To be more specific,\nthis paper proposes methods for deriving a probability density function on the\nset of all possible models, and also for constructing confidence intervals for\nthe corresponding parameters. These proposed methods are developed using the\ngeneralized fiducial methodology, which is a variant of Fisher's controversial\nfiducial idea. Theoretical properties of the proposed methods are studied, and\nin particular it is shown that statistical inference based on the proposed\nmethods will have exact asymptotic frequentist property. In terms of empirical\nperformances, the proposed methods are tested by simulation experiments and an\napplication to a real data set.

To fully exploit these observations, theorists\nmust provide predictions that are at least as accurate as the measurements, as\nwell as robust estimates of systematic errors that are inherent to the modeling\nprocess. In the nonlinear regime of structure formation, this challenge can\nonly be overcome by developing a large-scale, multi-physics simulation\ncapability covering a range of cosmological models and astrophysical processes.\nAs a first step to achieving this goal, we have recently developed a prediction\nscheme for the matter power spectrum (a so-called emulator), accurate at the 1%\nlevel out to k~1/Mpc and z=1 for wCDM cosmologies based on a set of\nhigh-accuracy N-body simulations. It is highly desirable to increase the range\nin both redshift and wavenumber and to extend the reach in cosmological\nparameter space. To make progress in this direction, while minimizing\ncomputational cost, we present a strategy that maximally re-uses the original\nsimulations. We demonstrate improvement over the original spatial dynamic range\nby an order of magnitude, reaching k~10 h/Mpc, a four-fold increase in redshift\ncoverage, to z=4, and now include the Hubble parameter as a new independent\nvariable. To further the range in k and z, a new set of nested simulations run\nat modest cost is added to the original set. The extension in h is performed by\nincluding perturbation theory results within a multi-scale procedure for\nbuilding the emulator. This economical methodology still gives excellent error\ncontrol, ~5% near the edges of the domain of applicability of the emulator.

The ACL2 specification is\nwritten using a single-threaded object (stobj) and tail recursion, as the\nstobj/tail recursion combination yields the most straightforward translation\nfrom imperative programming languages, as well as efficient, scalable\nexecutable specifications within ACL2 itself.

Path recovery is accomplished\nusing a secondary ACL2 stobj implementing a LIFO stack, which is proven\ncorrect. To conclude the experiment, we ported the ACL2 version of the APSP\nkernels back to C, resulting in a less than 5% slowdown, and also performed a\npartial back-port to CUDA, which, surprisingly, yielded a slight performance\nincrease.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Apr 2013 04:15:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-01"}

Analytical estimates of the importance of these\ncorrections to the transport coefficients in bulk conditions is provided.\nPoiseuille flow of the hard-sphere fluid confined between two parallel smooth\nwalls is studied and their pore-averaged properties are determined.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Apr 2013 05:22:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-01"}

A \"harvest-then-transmit\" protocol is\nproposed where all users first harvest the wireless energy broadcast by the\nH-AP in the downlink (DL) and then send their independent information to the\nH-AP in the uplink (UL) by time-division-multiple-access (TDMA). First, we\nstudy the sum-throughput maximization of all users by jointly optimizing the\ntime allocation for the DL wireless power transfer versus the users' UL\ninformation transmissions given a total time constraint based on the users' DL\nand UL channels as well as their average harvested energy values. By applying\nconvex optimization techniques, we obtain the closed-form expressions for the\noptimal time allocations to maximize the sum-throughput. Our solution reveals\n\"doubly near-far\" phenomenon due to both the DL and UL distance-dependent\nsignal attenuation, where a far user from the H-AP, which receives less\nwireless energy than a nearer user in the DL, has to transmit with more power\nin the UL for reliable information transmission. Consequently, the maximum\nsum-throughput is achieved by allocating substantially more time to the near\nusers than the far users, thus resulting in unfair rate allocation among\ndifferent users. To overcome this problem, we furthermore propose a new\nperformance metric so-called common-throughput with the additional constraint\nthat all users should be allocated with an equal rate regardless of their\ndistances to the H-AP. We present an efficient algorithm to solve the\ncommon-throughput maximization problem.

Since the substitution limit\nof hydrogen in LnFeAsO (x~0.5) is much higher than that of fluorine (x~0.2),\nthe hydrogen substitution technique provides an effective pathway for\nhigh-density electron-doping, making it possible to draw the complete\nelectronic phase diagram of LnFeAsO. The x-T diagrams of LnFeAsO1-xHx (Ln = La,\nCe, Sm, Gd) have a wide superconducting (SC) region spanning the range x = 0.04\nto 0.4, which is far from the parent antiferromagnetic region near x = 0.0. For\nLn=La, another SC dome region was found in the range x = ~ 0.2 to ~0.5 with a\nmaximum Tc = 36 K, in addition to a conventional SC dome located at x ~0.08\nwith maximum Tc = 29 K. Density functional theory calculations performed for\nLaFeAsO1-xHx indicated that the newly observed Tc is correlated with the\nappearance of degeneration of the Fe 3d bands (dxy, dyz and dzx), which is\ncaused not only by regularization of the tetrahedral shape of FeAs4 due to\nchemical pressure effects but also by selective band occupation with doped\nelectrons. In this article, we review the recent progress of superconductivity\nin iron (oxy)arsenides and related compounds induced by hydrogen substitution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Apr 2013 07:16:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-02"}

We compare\nour view of gas flows in M51 -- which arise due to departures from axi-symmetry\nin the gravitational potential (i.e. the nuclear bar and spiral arms) -- with\nthe global pattern of star formation as traced by Halpha and 24\\mu m emission.\nWe find that the dynamical environment of GMCs strongly affects their ability\nto form stars, in the sense that GMCs situated in regions with large streaming\nmotions can be stabilized, while similarly massive GMCs in regions without\nstreaming go on to efficiently form stars. We argue that this is the result of\nreduced surface pressure felt by clouds embedded in an ambient medium\nundergoing large streaming motions, which prevents collapse. Indeed, the\nvariation in gas depletion time expected based on the observed streaming\nmotions throughout the disk of M51 quantitatively agrees with the variation in\nobserved gas depletion time scale. The example of M51 shows that streaming\nmotions, triggered by gravitational instabilities in the form of bars and\nspiral arms, can alter the star formation law; this can explain the variation\nin gas depletion time among galaxies with different masses and morphologies. In\nparticular, we can explain the long gas depletion times in spiral galaxies\ncompared to dwarf galaxies and starbursts.

Recently, substantial progress was achieved in enhancing the\ntime within which a solid-state qubit demonstrates coherent dynamics. This\nprogress is based mostly on a successful isolation of the qubits from external\ndecoherence sources obtained by clever engineering. Under these conditions, the\nmaterial-inherent sources of noise start to play a crucial role. In most cases,\nquantum devices are affected by noise decreasing with frequency, f,\napproximately as 1/f. According to the present point of view, such noise is due\nto material- and device-specific microscopic degrees of freedom interacting\nwith quantum variables of the nanodevice. The simplest picture is that the\nenvironment that destroys the phase coherence of the device can be thought of\nas a system of two-state fluctuators, which experience random hops between\ntheir states. If the hopping times are distributed in a exponentially broad\ndomain, the resulting fluctuations have a spectrum close to 1/f in a large\nfrequency range. In this paper we review the current state of the theory of\ndecoherence due to degrees of freedom producing 1/f noise. We discuss basic\nmechanisms of such noises in various nanodevices and then review several models\ndescribing the interaction of the noise sources with quantum devices. The main\nfocus of the review is to analyze how the 1/f noise destroys their coherent\noperation. We start from individual qubits concentrating mostly on the devices\nbased on superconductor circuits, and then discuss some special issues related\nto more complicated architectures. Finally, we consider several strategies for\nminimizing the noise-induced decoherence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Apr 2013 09:11:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Dec 2013 10:36:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-10"}

Eight of these groups have two large spiral galaxies with several\ndwarf galaxies and may be thought of as morphological analogues of the Local\nGroup.

In particular it is hard to distinguish between\ngeneric properties and peculiarities due to the abstracted model. Here we\npresent a unified view on pairwise covariances in recurrent networks in the\nirregular regime. We consider the binary neuron model, the leaky\nintegrate-and-fire model, and the Hawkes process. We show that linear\napproximation maps each of these models to either of two classes of linear rate\nmodels, including the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process as a special case. The classes\ndiffer in the location of additive noise in the rate dynamics, which is on the\noutput side for spiking models and on the input side for the binary model. Both\nclasses allow closed form solutions for the covariance. For output noise it\nseparates into an echo term and a term due to correlated input. The unified\nframework enables us to transfer results between models. For example, we\ngeneralize the binary model and the Hawkes process to the presence of\nconduction delays and simplify derivations for established results. Our\napproach is applicable to general network structures and suitable for\npopulation averages. The derived averages are exact for fixed out-degree\nnetwork architectures and approximate for fixed in-degree.

Analysis of a complete data set, not\nconsidered before, reveals a chain of eruptions to which hard X-ray and\nmicrowave bursts responded. A filament in AR 10501 was not a passive part of a\nlarger flux rope, as usually considered. The filament erupted and gave origin\nto a CME. The chain of events was as follows: i) an eruption at 07:29\naccompanied by a not reported M1.2 class flare associated with the onset of a\nfirst southeastern CME1, which is not responsible for the superstorm; ii) a\nconfined eruption at 07:41 (M3.2 flare) that destabilized the filament; iii)\nthe filament acceleration (07:56); iv) the bifurcation of the eruptive filament\nthat transformed into a large cloud; v) an M3.9 flare in AR 10501 associated to\nthis transformation. The transformation of the filament could be due to its\ninteraction with the magnetic field in the neighborhood of a null point,\nlocated at a height of about 100 Mm above the complex formed by ARs 10501,\n10503, and their environment. The CORONAS-F/SPIRIT telescope observed the cloud\nin 304 A as a large Y-shaped darkening, which moved from the bifurcation region\nto the limb.

In this network, there exist six possible transmission\nmodes: four point-to-point modes (user 1-to-relay, user 2-to-relay,\nrelay-to-user 1, relay-to-user 2), a multiple access mode (both users to the\nrelay), and a broadcast mode (the relay to both users). Most existing protocols\nassume a fixed schedule of using a subset of the aforementioned transmission\nmodes, as a result, the sum rate is limited by the capacity of the weakest link\nassociated with the relay in each time slot. Motivated by this limitation, we\ndevelop a protocol which is not restricted to adhere to a predefined schedule\nfor using the transmission modes.

From\ntime-resolved photometry of the system obtained during six nights (covering\nmore than twenty primary eclipse cycles in more than three years), we show that\nthis binary presents a strong primary and a weak secondary modulation. Our\nlight curve analysis shows that only two fundamental frequencies are present,\ncorresponding to the orbital period and a modulation with twice this frequency.\nWe determine the accurate ephemeris of the system to be HJD(eclipse)=\n2454967.6750(1) + 0.06531866661(1) E. A double-hump orbital period modulation,\na standing feature in several bounce-back systems at quiescence, is present at\nseveral epochs.

In order\nto avoid the erosive consequences of neutron emission, one studies the cold\nfission regions, corresponding to total kinetic energy (TE) close to the\nmaximum available energy of the reaction (Q). Contrary to expected, in cold\nfission is not observed high odd-even effect in mass number distribution.\nNevertheless, the measured values are compatible with higher odd-even effects\non proton or neutron number distribution, respectively. In addition, in cold\nfission, the minimal total excitation energy (X) is correlated with the Coulomb\nenergy excess, which is defined as the difference between C (the electrostatic\ninteraction energy between complementary fragments taken as spherical in\nscission configuration) and Q. These Coulomb effects increase with the\nasymmetry of the charge fragmentations.

It is\nfurther shown that for certain values of the bulk and shear viscosity and\nequation of state parameters, the model isotropizes at late times.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Apr 2013 15:52:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 May 2013 02:01:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 15 Jul 2013 03:25:41 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 4 Sep 2013 22:24:20 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 24 Feb 2014 21:44:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-26"}

Based on\nthe calculated magnetic response functions, the relative relaxation times for\nthe magnetic moments of impurity orbitals are estimated. To study the effect of\nthe dynamical correlations on the exchange interaction in nanoclusters, we\nsolve the two-impurity Anderson model for the Mn dimer on the CuN surface.
