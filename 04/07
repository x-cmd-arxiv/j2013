Linear minimum mean square error (MMSE)\nreceive filters and adjustable code matrices are considered subject to a power\nconstraint with an amplify-and-forward (AF) cooperation strategy. In the\nproposed adaptive DSTC scheme, an adjustable code matrix obtained by a feedback\nchannel is employed to transform the space-time coded matrix at the relay node.\nThe effects of the limited feedback and the feedback errors are assessed.\nLinear MMSE expressions are devised to compute the parameters of the adjustable\ncode matrix and the linear receive filters. Stochastic gradient (SG) and\nleast-squares (LS) algorithms are also developed with reduced computational\ncomplexity. An upper bound on the pairwise error probability analysis is\nderived and indicates the advantage of employing the adjustable code matrices\nat the relay nodes.

Thus the paper makes a fundamental\nconnection between Gaussian beams and an acoustic channel's so-called intrinsic\nGaussian curvature from differential geometry. (2) A new formula\n$\\pi(c/c\")^{1/2}$ for the distance between convergence zones is derived and\napplied to several well-known profiles. (3) A class of \"model spaces\" are\nintroduced that connect the acoustics of ducting/divergence zones with the\nchannel's Gaussian curvature $K=cc\"-(c')^2$. The \"model\" SSPs yield constant\nGaussian curvature in which the geometry of ducts corresponds to great circles\non a sphere and convergence zones correspond to antipodes. The distance between\ncaustics $\\pi(c/c\")^{1/2}$ is equated with an ideal hyperbolic cosine SSP duct.\n(4) An \"intrinsic\" version of \\v{C}erven\\'y's formulae for the amplitude and\nphase of Gaussian beams is derived that does not depend on an \"extrinsic\"\narbitrary choice of coordinates such as range and depth. Direct comparisons are\nmade between the computational frameworks used by the three different\napproaches to Gaussian beams: Snell's law, the extrinsic Frenet-Serret\nformulae, and the intrinsic Jacobi methods presented here.

Each double-helix structure consists of an infinite repetition\nof one B-DNA coil with 10 base pairs. This parameter-free density functional\ntheory (DFT) study illustrates the initial step in a proposed vdW-DF\ncomputational strategy for large biomolecular problems. The strategy is to\nfirst perform a survey of interaction geometries, based on the evaluation of\nthe van der Waals (vdW) attraction, and then limit the evaluation of the\nremaining DFT parts (specifically the expensive study of the kinetic-energy\nrepulsion) to the thus identified interesting geometries. Possibilities for\naccelerating this second step is detailed in a separate study. For the B-DNA\ndimer, the variation in van der Waals attraction is explored at relatively\nshort distances (although beyond the region of density overlap) for a 360\ndegrees rotation. This study highlights the role of the structural motifs, like\nthe grooves, in enhancing or reducing the vdW interaction strength.

We argue that the lattice degrees of freedom seems\nto be crucial for this novel phenomenon. We motivate a theoretical model that\ntakes into account one valence and three conduction bands, a strongly screened\nCoulomb interaction between the electrons, as well as the coupling of the\nelectrons to a transverse optical phonon mode. The Falicov-Kimball model\nextended in this way possesses a charge-density-wave state at low temperatures,\nwhich is accompanied by a periodic lattice distortion. The charge ordering is\ndriven by a lattice deformation and electron-hole pairing (excitonic)\ninstability in combination. We show that both electron-phonon interaction and\nphonon-phonon interaction must be taken into account at least up to quartic\norder in the lattice displacement to achieve a stable chiral charge order. The\nchiral property is exhibited in the ionic displacements. Furthermore, we\nprovide the ground-state phase diagram of the model and give an estimate of the\nelectron-electron and electron-phonon interaction constants for 1$T$-TiSe$_2$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Apr 2013 07:40:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 24 Aug 2013 08:54:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

We successfully obtained the shot profiles covering 10--200 keV with the\nSuzaku HXD-PIN and HXD-GSO detector. It is notable that the 100-200 keV shot\nprofile is acquired for the first time owing to the HXD-GSO detector. The\nintensity changes in a time-symmetric way, though the hardness does in a\ntime-asymmetric way. When the shot-phase-resolved spectra are quantified with\nthe Compton model, the Compton y-parameter and the electron temperature are\nfound to decrease gradually through the rising phase of the shot, while the\noptical depth appears to increase.

However, the limited observational length of\nexisting human interaction datasets, together with the bursty nature of dyadic\ncommunications have hampered the observation of tie dynamics in social\nnetworks. Here we develop a method for the detection of tie\nactivation/deactivation, and apply it to a large longitudinal, cross-sectional\ncommunication dataset ($\\approx$ 19 months, $\\approx$ 20 million people).\nContrary to the perception of ever-growing connectivity, we observe that\nindividuals exhibit a finite communication capacity, which limits the number of\nties they can maintain active. In particular we find that men have an overall\nhigher communication capacity than women and that this capacity decreases\ngradually for both sexes over the lifespan of individuals (16-70 years). We are\nthen able to separate communication capacity from communication activity,\nrevealing a diverse range of tie activation patterns, from stable to\nexploratory. We find that, in simulation, individuals exhibiting exploratory\nstrategies display longer time to receive information spreading in the network\nthose individuals with stable strategies. Our principled method to determine\nthe communication capacity of an individual allows us to quantify how\nstrategies for human interaction shape the dynamical evolution of social\nnetworks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Apr 2013 11:00:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-09"}

These stability criteria are, in turn, losslessly extended\nto stabilization using a particular, yet broad enough, class of state-feedback\ncontrollers, providing then a convex solution to the open problem of robust\ndwell-time stabilization of impulsive systems using hybrid stability criteria.\nRelying finally on the representability of sampled-data systems as impulsive\nsystems, the problems of robust stability analysis and robust stabilization of\nperiodic and aperiodic uncertain sampled-data systems are straightforwardly\nsolved using the same ideas. Several examples are discussed in order to show\nthe effectiveness and reduced complexity of the proposed approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Apr 2013 13:41:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Nov 2013 21:21:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-15"}

However, the underlying physics of this observed relation is\npoorly understood. In order to study the effects of X-ray radiation on the\nsurroundings of the black hole, we implement X-ray Dominated Region (XDR)\nphysics into Enzo and use the radiation transport module Moray to calculate the\nradiative transfer for a polychromatic spectrum. In this work, we investigate\nthe effects of X-ray irradiation, produced by a central massive black hole\n(MBH) with a mass of M = 5x10^4 M_(solar), on ambient gas with solar and zero\nmetallicity. We find that in the solar metallicity case, due to high opacity of\nthe metals, the energy deposition rate in the central region (< 20 pc) is high\nand hence the temperatures in the center are on the order of 10^(5-7) K.\nMoreover, due to the cooling ability and high intrinsic opacity of solar\nmetallicity gas, column densities of 10^(24) cm^(-2) are reached at a radius of\n20 pc from the MBH. These column densities are about 3 orders of magnitudes\nhigher than in the zero metallicity case. Furthermore, in the zero metallicity\ncase an X-ray induced H II region is formed already after 5.8 Myr. This causes\na significant outflow of gas (~8x10^6 M_(solar) from the central region, with\nthe gas reaching outflow velocities up to ~100 km s^(-1). At later times, ~23\nMyr after we insert the MBH, we find that the solar metallicity case also\ndevelops an X-ray induced H II region, but delayed by ~17 Myr.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Apr 2013 13:53:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

In this model the possibility of unification of scalar gravity and\nelectromagnetism into a single united field is considered. Formally, the\ngeneralization of the SRT is that instead of (1+3)-dimensional Minkowski space\nthe (1+4)-dimensional extension G is considered. As a fifth additional\ncoordinate the interval S is used. This value is saved under the usual Lorentz\ntransformations in Minkowski space M, but it changes when the transformations\nin the extended space G are used. We call this model the extended space model\n(ESM). From a physical point of view our expansion means that processes in\nwhich the rest mass of the particles changes are acceptable now. If the rest\nmass of a particle does not change and the physical quantities do not depend on\nan additional variable S, then the electromagnetic and gravitational fields\nexist independently of each other. But if the rest mass is variable and there\nis a dependence on S, then these two fields are combined into a single united\nfield. In the extended space model a photon can have a nonzero mass and this\nmass can be either positive or negative. The gravitational effects such as the\nspeed of escape, gravitational red shift and deflection of light can be\nanalyzed in the frame of the extended space model. In this model all these\ngravitational effects can be found algebraically by the rotations in the (1+4)\ndimensional space.
