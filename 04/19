It is important to investigate SUSY searches which do not rely on the\ncolored superparticles.\n  As a clue for the investigation, we focus on the muon g-2 anomaly, which can\nbe explained by the SUSY contributions if some of neutralinos, charginos, and\nsleptons are as light as of order 100 GeV. We propose the muon-(g-2)-motivated\nMSSM as a benchmark model, where squarks are decoupled but the superparticles\ncorresponding to the muon g-2 are light enough to explain the anomaly. We also\ninterpret the up-to-date results of LHC SUSY searches, and obtain experimental\nconstraints on the model.\n  We show searches for direct production of charginos and neutralinos work very\nwell against the scenario, but several regions are not only remain uncovered\nbut even found challenging to be searched for at the LHC.

They play an\nimportant role for the creation of synthetic gauge fields in cold atomic gases\nand the description of non-abelian anyon statistics. Moreover, it has been\nproposed to exploit non-abelian holonomic gates for robust quantum computation.\nIn contrast to abelian geometric phases, non-abelian ones have been observed\nonly in nuclear quadrupole resonance experiments with a large number of spins\nand without fully characterizing the geometric process and its non-commutative\nnature.

The key concept for VANET simulations is\na real world vehicular mobility model which will ensures conclusions drawn from\nsimulation experiments will carry through to real world deployments. In this\npaper we present a tool SUMO, MOVE that allows users to easily generate real\nworld mobility models for VANET simulations. MOVE tool is built on top of SUMO\nwhich is open source micro traffic simulator. Output of MOVE is a real world\nmobility model and can used by NS-2 and Qual-net simulator. In this paper we\nevaluate and compare ad hoc routing performance for vehicular nodes using MOVE,\nwhich is using random way point model. The simulation results are obtained when\nnodes are moving according to a real world mobility model which is\nsignificantly different from that of the generally used random way point model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Apr 2013 16:59:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-19"}

The 11-year solar cycle variation in\ncosmic rays is highly correlated with the strength of the heliospheric magnetic\nfield. Differences in GCR flux during alternate solar cycles yield a 22-year\ncycle, known as the Hale Cycle, which is thought to be due to different\nparticle drift patterns when the northern solar pole has predominantly positive\n(denoted a qA>0 cycle) or negative (qA<0) polarities. This results in the onset\nof the peak cosmic ray flux at Earth occurring earlier during qA>0 cycles than\nfor qA<0 cycles and hence the peak being more domed for qA>0 and more sharply\npeaked for qA<0. In this study, we demonstrate that properties of the\nlarge-scale heliospheric magnetic field are different during the declining\nphase of the qA<0 and qA>0 solar cycles, when the difference in GCR flux is\nmost apparent. This suggests that particle drifts may not be the sole mechanism\nresponsible for the Hale Cycle in GCR flux at Earth. However, it is also\ndemonstrated that these polarity-dependent heliospheric differences are evident\nduring the space-age but much less clear in earlier data: using geomagnetic\nreconstructions, it is shown that for the period of 1905 - 1965, alternate\npolarities do not give as significant a difference during the declining phase\nof the solar cycle. Thus we suggest that the 22-year cycle in cosmic ray flux\nis at least partly the result of direct modulation by the heliospheric magnetic\nfield and that this effect may be primarily limited to the grand solar maximum\nof the space-age.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Apr 2013 17:12:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 May 2013 10:37:44 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 27 Jul 2013 18:36:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

A shortcoming of Ball-Larus path profiling\nwas the inability to profile cyclic paths, making it difficult to mine\ninteresting execution patterns that span multiple loop iterations. Previous\nresults, based on rather complex algorithms, have attempted to circumvent this\nlimitation at the price of significant performance losses already for a small\nnumber of iterations. In this paper, we present a new approach to multiple\niterations path profiling, based on data structures built on top of the\noriginal Ball-Larus numbering technique.

This\nasymmetry is known to arise due to the transverse spin dependence of the target\nproton combined with a T-odd complex phase. Using the discrete symmetry\nproperties of transverse spinors, we show that the required complex phase\noriginates in the denominators of rescattering diagrams and their respective\ncuts. For simplicity, we work in a model where the proton consists of a valence\nquark and a scalar diquark. We then show that the phases generated in SIDIS and\nin DY originate from distinctly different cuts in the amplitudes, which at\nfirst appears to obscure the relationship between the single-spin asymmetries\nin the two processes. Nevertheless, further analysis demonstrates that the\ncontributions of these cuts are identical in the leading-twist Bjorken\nkinematics considered, resulting in the standard sign-flip relation between the\nSivers functions in SIDIS and DY. Physically, this fundamental, but yet\nuntested, prediction occurs because the Sivers effect in the Drell-Yan reaction\nis modified by the initial-state \"lensing\" interactions of the annihilating\nantiquark, in contrast to the final-state lensing which produces the Sivers\neffect in deep inelastic scattering.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Apr 2013 19:58:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-09"}

In\nthis Letter, we propose that this periodic variations could be explained by the\npulsation of massive protostars growing under rapid mass accretion with rates\nof Mdot > 10^-3 Msun/yr. Our stellar evolution calculations predict that the\nmassive protostars have very large radius exceeding 100 Rsun at maximum, and we\nhere study the pulsational stability of such the bloated protostars by way of\nthe linear stability analysis. We show that the protostar becomes pulsationally\nunstable with various periods of several 10-100 days, depending on different\naccretion rates. With the fact that the stellar luminosity when the star is\npulsationally unstable also depends on the accretion rate, we derive the\nperiod-luminosity relation log (L/Lsun) = 4.62 + 0.98log(P/100 day), which is\ntestable with future observations. Our models further show that the radius and\nmass of the pulsating massive protostar should also depend on the period. It\nwould be possible to infer such protostellar properties and the accretion rate\nwith the observed period. Measuring the maser periods enables a direct\ndiagnosis of the structure of accreting massive protostars, which are deeply\nembedded in dense gas and inaccessible with other observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Apr 2013 20:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

This paper considers\ntwo types of guard zones that may be used to control the near-far problem: a\nfundamental exclusion zone and an additional CSMA guard zone that may be\nestablished by the carrier-sense multiple-access (CSMA) protocol. In the\nexclusion zone, no mobiles are physically present, modeling the minimum\nphysical separation among mobiles that is always present in actual networks.\nPotentially interfering mobiles beyond a transmitting mobile's exclusion zone,\nbut within its CSMA guard zone, are deactivated by the protocol. This paper\nprovides an analysis of DS-CSMA networks with either or both types of guard\nzones. A network of finite extent with a finite number of mobiles and uniform\nclustering as the spatial distribution is modeled. The analysis applies a\nclosed-form expression for the outage probability in the presence of Nakagami\nfading, conditioned on the network geometry. The tradeoffs between exclusion\nzones and CSMA guard zones are explored for DS-CDMA and unspread networks. The\nspreading factor and the guard-zone radius provide design flexibility in\nachieving specified levels of average outage probability and transmission\ncapacity. The advantage of an exclusion zone over a CSMA guard zone is that\nsince the network is not thinned, the number of active mobiles remains\nconstant, and higher transmission capacities can be achieved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Apr 2013 04:03:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-22"}

Rosenberg [KR] proposed a heuristic\nprinciple according to which the family of schemes ${Rep_n(A)}$ parametrizing\nthe finite-dimensional represen- tations of a noncommutative algebra A should\nbe thought of as a substitute or \"approximation\" for Spec(A). The idea is that\nevery property or noncommutative geometric structure on A should induce a\ncorresponding geometric property or structure on $Rep_n(A)$ for all n. In\nrecent years, many interesting structures in noncommutative geometry have\noriginated from this idea. In practice, however, if an associative algebra A\npossesses a property of geometric nature (e.g., A is a NC complete\nintersection, Cohen-Macaulay, Calabi-Yau, etc.), it often happens that, for\nsome n, the scheme $Rep_n(A)$ fails to have the corresponding property in the\nusual algebro-geometric sense. The reason for this seems to be that the\nrepresentation functor $Rep_n$ is not \"exact\" and should be replaced by its\nderived functor $DRep_n$ (in the sense of non-abelian homological algebra). The\nhigher homology of $DRep_n(A)$, which we call representation homology,\nobstructs $Rep_n(A)$ from having the desired property and thus measures the\nfailure of the Kontsevich-Rosenberg \"approximation.\" In this paper, which is\nmostly a survey, we prove several results confirming this intuition.

Partial frequency redistribution (PRD) is necessary to interpret the\nlinear polarization observed in strong resonance lines. Usually angle-averaged\nPRD functions are used to analyze linear polarization. However it is\nestablished that angle-dependent PRD functions are often necessary to interpret\npolarization profiles formed in the presence of weak magnetic fields. Our aim\nis to present an efficient decomposition technique, and the numerical method to\nsolve the concerned angle-dependent line transfer problem. Together with the\nstandard Stokes decomposition technique we employ Fourier expansion over the\noutgoing azimuth angle to express in a more convenient form, the\nangle-dependent PRD function for the Hanle effect. It allows the use of\nangle-dependent frequency domains of Bommier to solve the Hanle transfer\nproblem.

In particular, we ask if\nsuch FDs are caused mainly by coronal mass ejections (CMEs) from the Sun that\nare directed towards the Earth, or by their associated shocks. We use the muon\ndata at cutoff rigidities ranging from 14 to 24 GV from the GRAPES-3 tracking\nmuon telescope to identify FD events. We select those FD events that have a\nreasonably clean profile, and can be reasonably well associated with an\nEarth-directed CME and its associated shock. We employ two models: one that\nconsiders the CME as the sole cause of the FD (the CME-only model) and one that\nconsiders the shock as the only agent causing the FD (the shock-only model). We\nuse an extensive set of observationally determined parameters for both these\nmodels. The only free parameter in these models is the level of MHD turbulence\nin the sheath region, which mediates cosmic ray diffusion (into the CME, for\nthe CME-only model and across the shock sheath, for the shock-only model).\n  We find that good fits to the GRAPES-3 multi-rigidity data using the CME-only\nmodel require turbulence levels in the CME sheath region that are only slightly\nhigher than those estimated for the quiet solar wind. On the other hand,\nreasonable model fits with the shock-only model require turbulence levels in\nthe sheath region that are an order of magnitude higher than those in the quiet\nsolar wind.\n  This observation naturally leads to the conclusion that the Earth-directed\nCMEs are the primary contributors to FDs observed in high rigidity cosmic rays.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Apr 2013 08:48:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-03"}

The recent\nstatistical literature has seen an emergence of new selection methods that\nprovide some type of compromise between implementation (computational speed)\nand statistical optimality (e.g., prediction error minimization). Global\nmethods such as Mallows' $C_p$ have been supplanted by sequential methods such\nas stepwise regression. More recently, streamwise regression, faster than the\nformer, has emerged. A recently proposed streamwise regression approach based\non the variance inflation factor (VIF) is promising, but its least-squares\nbased implementation makes it susceptible to the outliers inevitable in such\nlarge data sets. This lack of robustness can lead to poor and suboptimal\nfeature selection. In our case, we seek to predict an individual's educational\nattainment using economic and demographic variables. We show how classical VIF\nperforms this task poorly and a robust procedure is necessary for policy\nmakers.

The comparison to previous results\nin the literature shows that the treatment of next-to-leading logarithmic\neffects is important for the fall-off of the Sivers asymmetry with energy in\nthe measurable regime. The TMD factorization based approach indicates that the\npeak of the Sivers asymmetry falls off with energy scale Q to good\napproximation as 1/Q^{0.7}, somewhat faster than found previously based on the\nfirst TMD factorization expressions by Collins and Soper in 1981. It is found\nthat the peak of the asymmetry moves rather slowly towards higher transverse\nmomentum values as $Q$ increases, which may be due to the absence of\nperturbative tails of the TMDs in the presented treatments. We conclude that\nthe behavior of the peak of the asymmetry as a function of energy {\\it and}\ntransverse momentum allows for valuable tests of the TMD formalism and the\nconsidered approximations.

Such networks are found as\nmodeling tools in many biological disciplines such as biochemistry, ecology,\nepidemiology, immunology, systems biology and synthetic biology.

The avalanches,\npotentially harmful for superconductor-based devices, can be suppressed by an\nadjacent normal metal layer, even when the two layers are not in thermal\ncontact. The suppression of the avalanches in this case is due to so-called\nmagnetic braking, caused by eddy currents generated in the metal layer by\npropagating magnetic flux. We develop a theory of magnetic braking by analyzing\ncoupled electrodynamics and heat flow in a superconductor-normal metal bilayer.\nThe equations are solved by linearization and by numerical simulation of the\navalanche dynamics. We find that in an uncoated superconductor, even a uniform\nthermomagnetic instability can develop into a dendritic flux avalanche. The\nmechanism is that a small non-uniformity caused by the electromagnetic\nnon-locality induces a flux-flow hot spot at a random position. The hot spot\nquickly develops into a finger, which at high speeds penetrates into the\nsuperconductor, forming a branching structure. Magnetic braking slows the\navalanches, and if the normal metal conductivity is sufficiently high, it can\nsuppress the formation of the dendritic structure. During avalanches, the\nbraking by the normal metal layer prevents the temperature from exceeding the\ntransition temperature of the superconductor. Analytical criteria for the\ninstability threshold are developed using the linear stability analysis. The\ncriteria are found to match quantitatively the instability onsets obtained in\nsimulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Apr 2013 13:03:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-30"}

Further complications arise\nwhen the long-range Coulomb force is present.\n  Purpose: We aim at calculating proton-${}^3$He elastic scattering observables\nabove three- and four-cluster breakup threshold.\n  Methods: We employ Alt, Grassberger, and Sandhas (AGS) equations for the\nfour-nucleon transition operators and solve them in the momentum-space\nframework using the complex-energy method whose accuracy and practical\napplicability is improved by a special integration method.\n  Results: Using realistic nuclear interaction models we obtain fully converged\nresults for the proton-${}^3$He elastic scattering. The differential cross\nsection, proton and ${}^3$He analyzing powers, spin correlation and spin\ntransfer coefficients are calculated at proton energies ranging from 7 to 35\nMeV.

There is quite good agreement\nbetween the theoretical predictions and experimental data for the\nproton-${}^3$He scattering in the considered energy regime. The most remarkable\ndisagreements are the peak of the proton analyzing power at lower energies and\nthe minimum of the differential cross section at higher energies.
