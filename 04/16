The primary motivation comes from the study of\nlogics for querying graph topology, which have recently found numerous\napplications. Such logics use conditions on paths expressed by regular\nlanguages and relations, but they often need to be extended by rational\nrelations such as subword or subsequence. Evaluating formulae in such extended\ngraph logics boils down to checking nonemptiness of the intersection of\nrational relations with regular or recognizable relations (or, more generally,\nto the generalized intersection problem, asking whether some projections of a\nregular relation have a nonempty intersection with a given rational relation).\n  We prove that for several basic and commonly used rational relations, the\nintersection problem with regular relations is either undecidable (e.g., for\nsubword or suffix, and some generalizations), or decidable with\nnon-primitive-recursive complexity (e.g., for subsequence and its\ngeneralizations). These results are used to rule out many classes of graph\nlogics that freely combine regular and rational relations, as well as to\nprovide the simplest problem related to verifying lossy channel systems that\nhas non-primitive-recursive complexity. We then prove a dichotomy result for\nlogics combining regular conditions on individual paths and rational relations\non paths, by showing that the syntactic form of formulae classifies them into\neither efficiently checkable or undecidable cases.

Our objective is to estimate their X-ray peak\nfluxes from EUVI data by finding a relation of the EUVI with GOES X-ray fluxes.\nBecause of the presence of the Fe xxiv line at 192 A, the response of the EUVI\n195 A channel has a secondary broad peak around 15 MK, and its fluxes closely\ntrace X-ray fluxes during the rise phase of flares. If the flare plasma is\nisothermal, the EUVI flux should be directly proportional to the GOES flux. In\nreality, the multithermal nature of the flare and other factors complicate the\nestimation of the X-ray fluxes from EUVI observations. We discuss the uncer-\ntainties, by comparing GOES fluxes with the high cadence EUV data from the\nAtmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory\n(SDO). We conclude that the EUVI 195 A data can provide estimates of the X-ray\npeak fluxes of intense flares (e.g., above M4 in the GOES scale) with\nuncertainties of a factor of a few. Lastly we show examples of intense flares\nfrom regions far behind the limb, some of which show eruptive signatures in AIA\nimages.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Apr 2013 16:43:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-16"}

The flare\nconsists of a main circular ribbon that occurred in a parasitic magnetic\nconfiguration and a remote ribbon that was observed by the IBIS. Such a\ncircular-ribbon flare with a remote brightening is predicted in 3D fan-spine\nreconnection but so far has been rarely observed. During the flare impulsive\nphase, we define \"core\" and \"halo\" structures in the observed ribbon. Examining\nthe \\ha\\ emission spectra averaged in the flare core and halo areas, we find\nthat only those from the flare cores show typical nonthermal electron beam\nheating characteristics. These characteristics include: broad and centrally\nreversed emission spectra, excess emission in the red wing with regard to the\nblue wing (i.e., red asymmetry), and redshifted bisectors of the emission\nspectra. We also observe rather quick timescales for the heating (30 s) and\ncooling (14--33 s) in the flare core locations. Therefore, we suggest that the\nflare cores revealed by IBIS track the sites of electron beam precipitation\nwith exceptional spatial and temporal resolution. The flare cores show\ntwo-stage motion (a parallel motion along the ribbon followed by an expansion\nmotion perpendicular to the ribbon) during the two impulsive phases of the\nflare. Some cores jump quickly (30 \\kms) between discrete magnetic elements\nimplying reconnection involving different flux tubes.

We investigate the Galactic globular\ncluster NGC 5286 for indications of a central IMBH using spectroscopic data\nfrom VLT/FLAMES, velocity measurements from the Rutgers Fabry Perot at CTIO,\nand photometric data from HST. We run analytic spherical and axisymmetric Jeans\nmodels with different central black-hole masses, anisotropy, mass-to-light\nratio, and inclination. Further, we compare the data to a grid of N-body\nsimulations without tidal field. Additionally, we use one N-body simulation to\ncheck the results of the spherical Jeans models for the total cluster mass.\nBoth the Jeans models and the N-body simulations favor the presence of a\ncentral black hole in NGC 5286 and our detection is at the 1- to 1.5-sigma\nlevel. From the spherical Jeans models we obtain a best fit with black-hole\nmass M_BH=(1.5+-1.0)x10^3 M_sun. The error is the 68% confidence limit from\nMonte Carlo simulations. Axisymmetric models give a consistent result. The best\nfitting N-body model is found with a black hole of 0.9% of the total cluster\nmass (4.38+-0.18)x10^5 M_sun, which results in an IMBH mass of\nM_BH=(3.9+-2.0)x10^3 M_sun.

Our test of the Jeans models with N-body simulation data shows\nthat this discrepancy has two reasons: The influence of a radially varying M/L\nprofile, and underestimation of the velocity dispersion as the measurements are\nlimited to bright stars.

The AI signals about bad\nlow aversive qualities, which make us sick or cause discomfort. These cortical\ninputs activate directly and indirectly (via D2 loop of VS) the LHb, which\ninhibits dopamine and serotonin release (and is reciprocally inhibited by VTA,\nDRN) to avoid choosing and doing things leading to harm or loss, but also to\nmake us feel worse, down when overstimulated.

We use the analysis of X-ray\nobservations in order to study the polar cap region of radio pulsars. The size\nof the hot spots implies that the magnetic field configuration just above the\nstellar surface differs significantly from a purely dipole one. We can estimate\nthe surface magnetic field as of the order of $10^{14}\\,{\\rm G}$. On the other\nhand, the temperature of the hot spots is about a few million Kelvins. Based on\nthese two facts the Partially Screened Gap (PSG) model was proposed to describe\nthe Inner Acceleration Region (IAR). The PSG model assumes that the temperature\nof the actual polar cap is equal to the so-called critical value, i.e. the\ntemperature at which the outflow of thermal ions from the surface screens the\ngap completely.\n  We have found that, depending on the conditions above the polar cap, the\ngeneration of high energetic photons in IAR can be caused either by Curvature\nRadiation (CR) or by Inverse Compton Scattering (ICS). This results in two\ndifferent scenarios of breaking the acceleration gap: the so-called PSG-off\nmode for CR-dominated gaps and the PSG-on mode ICS-dominated gaps. The\nexistence of two different mechanisms of gap breakdown naturally explains the\nmode-changing and the pulse nulling. Furthermore, the mode changes of the IAR\nmay explain the anti-correlation of radio and X-ray emission in very recent\nobservations of PSR B0943+10 (Hermsen et al., 2013).\n  Simultaneous analysis of X-ray and radio properties have allowed to develop a\nmodel which explains the drifting subpulse phenomenon. According to this model\nthe drift takes place when the charge density in IAR differs from the\nGoldreich-Julian co-rotational density. The proposed model allows to verify\nboth the radio drift parameters and X-ray efficiency of the observed pulsars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Apr 2013 19:07:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 Apr 2013 17:52:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-19"}

The FourStar medium-band filters provide the\nequivalent of R~10 spectroscopy, which cleanly distinguishes between z~7 LBGs\nand brown dwarf stars. The distinction between stars and galaxies based on an\nobject's angular size can become unreliable even when using HST imaging; there\nexists at least one very compact z~7 candidate (FWHM~0.5-1 kpc) that is\nindistinguishable from a point source.

We argue that these observed properties are\ninconsistent with any known class of Galactic transients, and instead suggest a\ncosmological origin. The detection of incoherent radio emission at such\ndistances implies a large emitting region, from which we infer the presence of\nrelativistic ejecta.

We searched for possible high-energy counterparts to\nPTF11agg, but found no evidence for associated prompt emission. We therefore\nconsider three possible scenarios to account for a GRB-like afterglow without a\nhigh-energy counterpart: an \"untriggered\" GRB (lack of satellite coverage), an\n\"orphan\" afterglow (viewing-angle effects), and a \"dirty fireball\" (suppressed\nhigh-energy emission). The observed optical and radio light curves appear\ninconsistent with even the most basic predictions for off-axis afterglow\nmodels. The simplest explanation, then, is that PTF11agg is a normal, on-axis\nlong-duration GRB for which the associated high-energy emission was simply\nmissed. However, we have calculated the likelihood of such a serendipitous\ndiscovery by PTF and find that it is quite small (~ 2.6%). While not\ndefinitive, we nonetheless speculate that PTF11agg may represent a new, more\ncommon (> 4 times the on-axis GRB rate at 90% confidence) class of relativistic\noutbursts lacking associated high-energy emission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Apr 2013 20:00:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

In metals with sharp Drude peaks, the\nrelevant physics is correctly organized around the slow relaxation of\nalmost-conserved momenta. While in Fermi liquids both currents and momenta\nrelax slowly, due to the weakness of interactions among low energy excitations,\nin strongly interacting non-Fermi liquids typically only momenta relax slowly.\nIt follows that the conductivities of such non-Fermi liquids are obtained\nwithin a fundamentally different kinematics to Fermi liquids. Among these\nstrongly interacting non-Fermi liquids we distinguish cases with only one\nalmost-conserved momentum, which we term hydrodynamic metals, and with many\npatchwise almost-conserved momenta. For all these cases, we obtain universal\nexpressions for the ratio of conductivities that violate the Wiedemann-Franz\nlaw.

General forms of TMD-factorization fail\nfor such processes because of a previously noted incompatibility between the\nrequirements for TMD-factorization and the Ward identities of non-Abelian gauge\ntheories. We first review the basic steps for factorizing the gluon\ndistribution and then show that a conflict between TMD-factorization and the\nnon-Abelian Ward identity arises already at the level of a single extra soft or\ncollinear gluon when the partonic subprocess involves a TMD gluon distribution.\nNext we show that the resulting TMD-factorization violating effects produce\nleading-power final state spin asymmetries that would be classified as\nsubleading in a generalized TMD-factorization framework. We argue that similar\nextra TMD-factorization breaking effects may be necessary to explain a range of\nopen phenomenological QCD puzzles.

We employ a galaxy-galaxy lensing halo model which allows us to\nconstrain the halo mass and the satellite fraction. Our analysis is limited to\nlenses at redshifts between 0.2 and 0.4. We express the relationship between\nhalo mass and baryonic observable as a power law. For the luminosity-halo mass\nrelation we find a slope of 1.32+/-0.06 and a normalisation of\n1.19+0.06-0.07x10^13 h70^-1 Msun for red galaxies, while for blue galaxies the\nbest-fit slope is 1.09+0.20-0.13 and the normalisation is 0.18+0.04-0.05x10^13\nh70^-1 Msun. Similarly, we find a best-fit slope of 1.36+0.06-0.07 and a\nnormalisation of 1.43+0.11-0.08x10^13 h70^-1 Msun for the stellar mass-halo\nmass relation of red galaxies, while for blue galaxies the corresponding values\nare 0.98+0.08-0.07 and 0.84+0.20-0.16x10^13 h70^-1 Msun. For red lenses, the\nfraction which are satellites tends to decrease with luminosity and stellar\nmass, with the sample being nearly all satellites for a stellar mass of 2x10^9\nh70^-2 Msun. The satellite fractions are generally close to zero for blue\nlenses, irrespective of luminosity or stellar mass. This, together with the\nshallower relation between halo mass and baryonic tracer, is a direct\nconfirmation from galaxy-galaxy lensing that blue galaxies reside in less\nclustered environments than red galaxies. We also find that the halo model,\nwhile matching the lensing signal around red lenses well, is prone to\nover-predicting the large-scale signal for faint and less massive blue lenses.\nThis could be a further indication that these galaxies tend to be more isolated\nthan assumed.

We find that at least 35% (possibly up to 50%) of the detected LABOCA\nsources have been resolved into multiple SMGs, and that the average number of\nSMGs per LESS source increases with LESS flux density. Using the (now precisely\nknown) SMG positions, we empirically test the theoretical expectation for the\nuncertainty in the single-dish source positions. We also compare our catalog to\nthe previously predicted radio/mid-infrared counterparts, finding that 45% of\nthe ALESS SMGs were missed by this method. Our ~1.6\" resolution allows us to\nmeasure a size of ~9 kpc X 5 kpc for the rest-frame ~300 um emission region in\none resolved SMG, implying a star formation rate surface density of 80 M_sol\nyr^-1 kpc^-2, and we constrain the emission regions in the remaining SMGs to be\n<10 kpc. As the first statistically reliable survey of SMGs, this will provide\nthe basis for an unbiased multiwavelength study of SMG properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Apr 2013 20:58:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

Scenario Analysis is a methodology for modelling uncertainty in\nwater resources management modelling. Uncertainty if not considered\nappropriately in decision making will decrease reliability of decisions,\nespecially in long-term planning. One of the challenges in Scenario Analysis is\nhow scenarios are made. One of the most approved methods is statistical\nmodelling based on Auto-Regressive models. Stream flow future scenarios in\ndeveloped basins that human has made changes to the natural flow process could\nnot be generated directly by ARMA modelling. In this case, making scenarios for\nmonthly rainfall and using it in a water resources system model makes more\nsense. Rainfall is an ephemeral process which has zero values in some months\nwhich introduces some limitations in making use of monthly ARMA model.\nTherefore, a two stage modelling approach is adopted here which in the first\nstage yearly modelling is done. Within this yearly model three ranges are\nidentified: Dry, Normal and Wet. In the normal range yearly ARMA modelling is\nused. Dry and Wet range are considered as random processes and are modeled by\nfrequency analysis. Monthly distribution of rainfall, which is extracted from\navailable data from a moving average are considered to be deterministic and\nfixed in time. Each rainfall scenario is composed of a yearly ARMA process\nsuper-imposed by dry and wet events according to the frequency analysis. This\nmodelling framework is applied to available data from three rain-gauge stations\nin Iran. Results show this modelling approach has better consistency with\nobserved data in comparison with making use of ARMA modelling alone.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Apr 2013 00:14:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-17"}

The\npresent paper proposes two families of nonconforming finite elements of any odd\norder and one family of nonconforming finite elements of any even order on\nquadrilateral meshes. Degrees of freedom are given for these elements, which\nare proved to be well-defined for their corresponding shape function spaces in\na unifying way. These elements generalize three lower order nonconforming\nfinite elements on quadrilaterals to any order. In addition, these\nnonconforming finite element spaces are shown to be full spaces which is\nsomehow not discussed for nonconforming finite elements in literature before.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Apr 2013 01:01:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

First, we briefly outline the early\ndevelopments of the theory based on analyticity and unitarity of the S-matrix,\nincluding the derivation and exploration of the Regge trajectories and related\nmoving cuts. Special attention is paid to the concept of the Pomeron trajectory\nintroduced for description of total, elastic and diffractive cross sections at\nhigh energies and to the emergence of the dynamics of multi-Pomeron\ninteractions.The role of large longitudinal distances and color coherent\nphenomena for the understanding of inelastic diffraction in hadron-hadron\nscattering and deep inelastic scattering is emphasized. The connection of these\nphenomena to the cancellation of the contribution of the Glauber approximation\nin hadron-nucleus collisions and to the understanding of the Gribov-Glauber\napproximation is explained. The presence of different scales in perturbative\nQCD due to masses of heavy quarks has led to the emergence of numerous new\nphenomena including non-universality of the slopes of Regge trajectories made\nof light and heavy quarks and non-universal energy dependence of elastic cross\nsections. The application of the perturbative QCD techniques allowed us to\ncalculate from the first principles the interaction of small transverse size\ncolor singlets with hadrons leading to the development of the quantitative\ntheory of hard exclusive reactions and to the successful prediction of many\nregularities in hard large mass diffraction. It also led to the prediction of\nthe phenomenon of complete transparency of nuclear matter in QCD in special\nprocesses. The conflict of perturbative QCD with probability conservation for\nhigh energy processes of virtual photon-nucleon scattering is explained. Some\nproperties of the new QCD regime are outlined.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Apr 2013 02:12:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-23"}

Euclidean shortest paths and minimum-link paths between $s$\nand $t$ inside $P$ have been well studied. Both these kinds of paths are simple\nand piecewise-convex. However, computing optimal paths in the context of\ndiffuse or specular reflections does not seem to be an easy task. A path from a\nlight source $s$ to $t$ inside $P$ is called a diffuse reflection path if the\nturning points of the path lie in the interiors of the boundary edges of $P$. A\ndiffuse reflection path is said to be optimal if it has the minimum number of\nturning points amongst all diffuse reflection paths between $s$ and $t$. The\nminimum diffuse reflection path may not be simple. The problem of computing the\nminimum diffuse reflection path in low degree polynomial time has remained\nopen.\n  In our quest for understanding the geometric structure of the minimum diffuse\nreflection paths vis-a-vis shortest paths and minimum link paths, we define a\nnew kind of diffuse reflection path called a constrained diffuse reflection\npath where (i) the path is simple, (ii) it intersects only the eaves of the\nEuclidean shortest path between $s$ and $t$, and (iii) it intersects each eave\nexactly once. For computing a minimum constrained diffuse reflection path from\n$s$ to $t$, we present an $O(n(n+\\beta))$ time algorithm, where $\\beta =\\Theta\n(n^2)$ in the worst case. Here, $\\beta$ depends on the shape of the polygon. We\nalso establish some properties relating minimum constrained diffuse reflection\npaths and minimum diffuse reflection paths.

With\nthe aid of the recently introduced Stein kernel (related to a symmetric version\nof Bregman matrix divergence), we propose to perform sparse coding by embedding\nRiemannian manifolds into reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. This leads to a\nconvex and kernel version of the Lasso problem, which can be solved\nefficiently.

At filling 1/3, the ground states\ncarry a fractional Berry phase in the momentum basis.

We solve the interacting model analytically in the physically\nrelevant limit of a large band gap in the underlying band structure, the analog\nof a lowest Landau level projection. Our solution affords a simple physical\nunderstanding of the properties of the gapped interacting phase. We pinpoint\ncrucial differences to the fractional quantum Hall case by studying the Berry\nphase and the entanglement entropy associated with the degenerate ground\nstates. In particular, we conclude that the `fractional topological phase in\none-dimensional flatbands' is not a one-dimensional analog of the\ntwo-dimensional fractional quantum Hall states, but rather a charge density\nwave with a nontrivial Berry phase.

If we consider the\ncircumstellar Habitable Zone (HZ, often described in terms of planet semi-major\naxis and orbital eccentricity), we can ask, \"How does the HZ for an Earth-like\nexomoon differ from the HZ for an Earth-like exoplanet?\"\n  For the first time, we use 1D latitudinal energy balance modelling to address\nthis question. The model places an Earth-like exomoon in orbit around a Jupiter\nmass planet, which in turn orbits a Sun-like star. The exomoon's surface\ntemperature is evolved under the action of stellar insolation, atmospheric\ncooling, heat diffusion, eclipses and tidal heating. We use this model to carry\nout two separate investigations.\n  In the first, four test cases are run to investigate in detail the dependence\nof the exomoon climate on orbital direction, orbital inclination, and on the\nfrequency of stellar eclipse by the host planet. We find that lunar orbits\nwhich are retrograde to the planetary orbit exhibit greater climate variations\nthan prograde orbits, with global mean temperatures around 0.1 K warmer due to\nthe geometry of eclipses. If eclipses become frequent relative to the\natmospheric thermal inertia timescale, climate oscillations become extremely\nsmall.\n  In the second investigation, we carry out an extensive parameter study,\nrunning the model many times to study the habitability of the exomoon in the\n4-dimensional space composed of the planet semi-major axis and eccentricity,\nand the moon semi-major axis and eccentricity. We find that for zero moon\neccentricity, frequent eclipses allow the moon to remain habitable in regions\nof high planet eccentricity, but tidal heating severely constrains habitability\nin the limit of high moon eccentricity, making the habitable zone a sensitive\nfunction of moon semi-major axis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Apr 2013 09:21:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

Starting from the two-infall model for the\nGalaxy, which predicts too few low-metallicity stars, we add a gas outflow\nduring the halo phase with a rate proportional to the star formation rate\nthrough a free parameter, lambda. In addition, we consider a first generation\nof massive zero-metal stars in this two-infall + outflow model adopting two\ndifferent top-heavy initial mass functions and specific population III yields.\nThe metallicity distribution function of halo stars, as predicted by the\ntwo-infall + outflow model shows a good agreement with observations, when the\nparameter lambda=14 and the time scale for the first infall, out of which the\nhalo formed, is not longer than 0.2 Gyr, a lower value than suggested\npreviously. Moreover, the abundance patterns [X/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] for C, N and\nalpha-elements O, Mg, Si, S, Ca show a good agreement with the observational\ndata. If population III stars are included, under the assumption of different\ninitial mass functions, the overall agreement of the predicted stellar\nmetallicity distribution function with observational data is poorer than in the\ncase without population III. We conclude that it is fundamental to include both\na gas infall and outflow during the halo formation to explain the observed halo\nmetallicity distribution function, in the framework of a model assuming that\nthe stars in the inner halo formed mostly in situ. Moreover, we find that it\ndoes not exist a satisfactory initial mass function for population III stars\nwhich reproduces the observed halo metallicity distribution function.

In this\npaper, we present a study of one of the outflows in the region, OF1, which\nshows several properties similar to jets driven by low-mass protostars, such as\nHH211 and HH212. It is compact and collimated, and associated with extremely\nhigh velocity CO emission, and SiO emission at high velocities. We used a\nstate-of-the-art shock model to constrain the pre-shock density and shock\nvelocity of OF1. The model also allowed us to self-consistently estimate the\nmass of the OF1 outflow. The shock parameters inferred by the SiO modelling are\ncomparable with those found for low-mass protostars, only with higher pre-shock\ndensity values, yielding an outflow mass in agreement with those obtained for\nmolecular outflows driven by early B-type young stellar objects. Our study\nshows that it is possible to model the SiO emission in high-mass star-forming\nregions in the same way as for shocks from low-mass young stellar objects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Apr 2013 11:30:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

In part I we consider a discrepancy in the\nderivation of the electromagnetic self force for a point charge. In the point\ncharge framework the self force can be defined as an integral of the\nLienard-Wiechert stress 3-forms over a suitably defined worldtube. We show the\nSchott term may be obtained using a null displacement vector to define the\nworldtube providing certain conditions are realized.\n  Part II comprises an investigation into a problem in accelerator physics. In\na high energy accelerator the cross-section of the beampipe is not continuous\nand there exist geometric discontinuities such as collimators and cavities.\nWhen a relativistic bunch of particles passes such a discontinuity the field\ngenerated by a leading charge can interact with the wall and consequently\naffect the motion of trailing charges. The fields acting on the trailing\ncharges are known as (geometric) wakefields. We model a bunch of particles as a\none dimensional continuum of point charges and by calculating the accumulated\nLienard-Wiechert fields we address the possibility of reducing wakefields at a\ncollimator interface by altering the path of the beam prior to collimation.\nThis approach is facilitated by the highly relativistic regime in which lepton\naccelerators operate, where the Coulomb field given from the Lienard-Wiechert\npotential is highly collimated in the direction of motion. It will be seen that\nthe potential reduction depends upon the ratio of the bunch length to the width\nof the collimator aperture as well as the relativistic factor and path of the\nbeam. Given that the aperture of the collimator is generally on the order of\nmillimetres we will see that for very short bunches, on the order of hundredths\nof a picosecond, a significant reduction is achieved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Apr 2013 12:08:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-17"}

This model becomes more accurate as the density of the system is\nincreased. One of its advantages is that it permits a simple mapping to a spin\nsystem and the effective spin Hamiltonian is easily obtained for smooth\ninterparticle potentials. For a binary liquid mixture the effective spin\nHamiltonian is in the universality class of the Ising spin glass in a field. No\nphase transition at finite temperatures is therefore expected and the\ncorrelation length will stay finite right down to zero temperature. For binary\nmixtures of hard disks and spheres we were not able to obtain the effective\nspin Hamiltonian analytically, but have done simulations to obtain its form. It\nagain is in the universality class of the Ising spin glass in a field. However,\nin this case the effective field can be shown to go to zero at the density of\nmaximum packing in the model, (which is close to that of random close packing),\nwhich means that the correlation length will diverge as the density approaches\nits maximum. The exponent nu describing the divergence is related in d\ndimensions to the Ising spin glass domain wall energy exponent theta.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Apr 2013 12:48:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-17"}

In the Kondo region, the peak in Rq as a function\nof the magnetic field is recovered and proven to be in quantitative agreement\nwith previous numerical renormalization group results. In the\nvalence-fluctuation region, the peak in Rq is shown to persist, with a maximum\nvalue of h/2e^2, and an analytical expression is obtained using perturbation\ntheory. We extend our analysis to the SU(4) Anderson model where we also derive\nthe existence of a giant peak in the charge relaxation resistance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Apr 2013 14:09:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Jul 2013 14:35:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-16"}

In more complicated cases, especially where the fast subspace is very\nfast but complex or highly correlated, the fast-slow sampling methods can in\nprinciple give arbitrarily large performance gains.

Within the framework of the COSMOGRAIL collaboration we present 7- and\n8.5-year-long light curves and time-delay estimates for two gravitationally\nlensed quasars: SDSS J1206+4332 and HS 2209+1914. Methods. We monitored these\ndoubly lensed quasars in the R-band using four telescopes: the Mercator,\nMaidanak, Himalayan Chandra, and Euler Telescopes, together spanning a period\nof 7 to 8.5 observing seasons from mid-2004 to mid-2011. The photometry of the\nquasar images was obtained through simultaneous deconvolution of these data.\nThe time delays were determined from these resulting light curves using four\nvery different techniques: a dispersion method, a spline fit, a regression\ndifference technique, and a numerical model fit. This minimizes the bias that\nmight be introduced by the use of a single method. Results. The time delay for\nSDSS J1206+4332 is Delta_t AB = 111.3 +/- 3 days with A leading B, confirming a\npreviously published result within the error bars.

The study is\nbased on a sample of 258 rail, bridge, tunnel and road projects worth US$90\nbillion. The focus is on the dependence of cost escalation on (1) length of\nproject implementation phase, (2) size of project and (3) type of project\nownership. First, it is found with very high statistical significance that cost\nescalation is strongly dependent on length of implementation phase. The policy\nimplications are clear: Decision makers and planners should be highly concerned\nabout delays and long implementation phases because they translate into risks\nof substantial cost escalations. Second, it is found that projects have grown\nlarger over time and that for bridges and tunnels larger projects have larger\npercentage cost escalations. Finally, by comparing cost escalation for three\ntypes of project ownership--private, state-owned enterprise and other public\nownership--it is shown that the oft-seen claim that public ownership is\nproblematic and private ownership effective in curbing cost escalation is an\noversimplification. Type of accountability appears to matter more to cost\nescalation than type of ownership.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Apr 2013 14:53:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-17"}

Assuming current experimantal\nconstraints from the 7 and 8 TeV runs and taking into account the estimated top\n(anti-top) reconstruction efficiencies, we find that the 14 TeV upgraded LHC\nwith the planned integrated luminosity L=100 fb^-1 could access these\nquasi-degenerate multiple resonances and explore for the first time the rich\nphenomenology in the asymmetry observables. The main outcome would be having\nmeasurable quantities, complementary to the usual total and differential cross\nsections, capable of distiguishing a quasi-degenerate multiply resonant\nspectrum from a `standard' single resonance that could present a similar signal\nin a bump hunt analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Apr 2013 15:33:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 28 Jun 2013 11:58:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

In particular we\nshow that for highly compressible equations the speed of propagation of the\ndensity is quasi finite when the viscosity corresponds to\n$\\mu(\\rho)=\\rho^{\\alpha}$ with $\\alpha>1$. Furthermore the density is not far\nfrom converging asymptotically in time to the Barrenblatt solution of mass the\ninitial density $\\rho_{0}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Apr 2013 15:56:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-17"}

Remote state preparation (RSP) has the same goal as teleportation,\ni.e. transferring quantum information without sending physically the\ninformation carrier, but in RSP the sender knows the state which is to be\ntransmitted. We present experimental demonstrations of RSP for two and three\nlocations. In our experimental scheme Alice (the preparer) and her three\npartners share four and six photon polarization entangled singlets. This allows\nus to perform RSP of two or three copies of a single qubit states, a two qubit\nBell state, and a three qubit W, or inverse W state. A possibility to prepare a\ntwo-qubit non-maximally entangled and GHZ states is also discussed. The ability\nto remotely prepare an entangled states by local projections at Alice is a\ndistinguishing feature of our scheme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Apr 2013 15:59:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-11"}

The new data are used along with mid- and far-IR\nimaging data, and CO (J=3-2) spectral line maps downloaded from archives to\nidentify the YSO and study the properties of the outflow. Available\nradiative-transfer models are used to analyze the spectral energy distribution\n(SED) of the YSO.\n  Results: Previous tentative detection of an outflow in the H_2 (1-0) S1 line\n(2.122 micron) is confirmed through new and deeper observations. The outflow\nappears to be associated with a YSO discovered at infrared wavelengths. At high\nangular resolution, we see that the YSO is probably a binary. The CO (3--2)\nlines also reveal a well defined outflow. Nevertheless, the direction of the\noutflow deduced from the H_2 image does not agree with that mapped in CO. In\naddition, the age of the YSO obtained from the SED analysis is far lower than\nthe dynamical time of the outflow. We conclude that this is probably caused by\nthe contributions from a companion. High-angular-resolution observations at\nmid-IR through mm wavelengths are required to properly understand the complex\npicture of the star formation happening in this system, and generally in\nmassive star forming regions, which are located at large distances from us.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Apr 2013 20:59:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}
