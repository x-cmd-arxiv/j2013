Abundances of C, N, O, Li, Na, Mg, Al, Ca, Si, Ti, Ni, Cr, Y, Zr, La, Ce,\nand Nd were obtained, as well as the carbon isotopic ratio. Methods: The\natmospheric parameters of the studied stars and their chemical abundances were\ndetermined using high-resolution optical spectroscopy.

The abundances of the light elements were derived using the\nspectral synthesis technique. Results: We found that NGC 3114 has a mean\nmetallicity of [Fe/H] = -0.01+/-0.03.

Conclusions: The carbon and nitrogen abundance in\nNGC 3114 agree with the field and cluster giants. The oxygen abundance in NGC\n3114 is lower compared to the field giants.

We\nconcentrate on the case of a single adjoint hypermultiplet with a mass term and\nargue that the theory has a symmetry enlargement at mass M=1/(2r), where r is\nthe $S^5$ radius. However, in order to have a well-defined localization locus\nit is necessary to rotate M onto the imaginary axis, breaking the enlarged\nsymmetry. Based on our prescription, the imaginary mass values are physical and\nwe show how the localized path integral is consistent with earlier results for\n5D SYM in flat space.

The Wilson loop calculation\nshows a mass dependent constant rescaling between weak and strong coupling. The\nWilson loop continued back to to the enlarged symmetry point is consistent with\na supergravity computation for an M2 brane using the standard identification of\nthe compactification radius and the 5D coupling.

While the heaviest elements were synthesized by\nthe r- and s-processes, dominant production mechanisms of light trans-ironic\nelements were obscure until recently. This work investigates further our 2011\nconclusion that the low-entropy regime of a high-entropy wind (HEW) produced\nmolybdenum and ruthenium in two moderately metal-poor turnoff stars that showed\nextreme overabundances of those elements with respect to iron. Only a few, rare\nnucleosynthesis events may have been involved.\n  Here we determine abundances for Mo, Ru, and other trans-Fe elements for 28\nsimilar stars by matching spectral calculations to well-exposed near-UV Keck\nHIRES spectra obtained for beryllium abundances. In each of the 26 turnoff\nstars with Mo or Ru line detections and no evidence for s-process production\n(therefore old), we find Mo and Ru to be three to six times overabundant. In\ncontrast, the maximum overabundance is reduced to factors of three and two for\nthe neighboring elements zirconium and palladium. Since the overproduction\npeaks sharply at Mo and Ru, a low-entropy HEW is confirmed as its origin.\n  The overabundance level of the heavy r-process elements varies significantly,\nfrom none to a factor of four, but is uncorrelated with Mo and Ru\noverabundances. Despite their moderate metallicity, stars in this group trace\nthe products of different nucleosynthetic events: possibly very few events,\npossibly events whose output depended on environment, metallicity, or time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Apr 2013 18:47:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

As such, the skin must maintain a homeostatic\nbalance in the face of many microenvironmental and genetic perturbations. At\nits simplest, skin homeostasis is maintained by the balance between skin cell\ngrowth and death such that skin architecture is preserved. This study presents\na hybrid multiscale mathematical model of normal skin (vSkin). The model\nfocuses on key cellular and microenvironmental variables that regulate\nhomeostatic interactions among keratinocytes, melanocytes and fibroblasts, key\ncomponents of the skin. The model recapitulates normal skin structure, and is\nrobust enough to withstand physical as well as biochemical perturbations.\nFurthermore, the vSkin model revealed the important role of the skin\nmicroenvironment in melanoma initiation and progression. Our experiments showed\nthat dermal fibroblasts, which are an important source of growth factors in the\nskin, adopt a phenotype that facilitates cancer cell growth and invasion when\nthey become senescent. Based on these experimental results, we incorporated\nsenescent fibroblasts into vSkin model and showed that senescent fibroblasts\ntransform the skin microenvironment and enhance the growth and invasion of\nnormal melanocytes as well as early stage melanoma cells.

However, there are uncertainties from the ambiguity of colour\nand magnitude and the effects of interstellar reddening.\n  Aims: In this paper we present a detailed reddening map of the central 30\nDoradus region of the Large Magellanic Cloud; for community use and to test the\nmethods used. The reddening, a measurement of dust extinction, acts as a tracer\nof the interstellar medium (ISM).\n  Methods: Near infrared photometry of red clump stars are used to measure\nreddening as extinction is the main cause of their colour and magnitude\nvariance. The star formation history is used to convert colour to reddening\nvalues which are subsequently converted to visual extinction.\n  Results: Presented is a dust map for the 30 Doradus field. This map samples a\nregion of 1x1.5 deg, containing ~1.5x10^5 red clump stars which probe reddening\nup to AV=6 mag. We compare our map with maps from the literature, including\noptical extinction maps and radio, mid- and far-infrared maps of atomic\nhydrogen and dust emission. Through estimation of column density we locate\nmolecular clouds.\n  Conclusions: This new reddening map shows correlation with equivalent maps in\nthe literature, validating the method of red clump star selection. We make our\nreddening map available for community use. In terms of ISM the red clump stars\nappear to be more affected by the cooler dust measured by 70 micron emission\nbecause there is stronger correlation between increasing emission and\nextinction due to red clump stars not being located near hot stars that would\nheat the dust. The transition from atomic hydrogen to molecular hydrogen occurs\nbetween densities of NH=4x10^21 to 6x10^21 cm^-2.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Apr 2013 20:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

Surprisingly,\nrecent observations have suggested that the brightest SMGs are almost\nexclusively multiple fainter sources blended into a single source in the\nsingle-dish surveys. This result is in contrast with the predictions of our\npreviously presented theoretical model, which includes some effects of\nblending. In this Letter, we consider the implications of an upper limit on the\nsubmm flux density for the demographics of the SMG population. Using a relation\namongst submm flux, star formation rate (SFR), and dust mass (M_d) from our\nprevious work, we infer the maximum SFR for a range of flux density limits. For\nM_d = 2 x 10^9 (5 x 10^8) M_sun, the SFR limit that corresponds to an\n870-{\\mu}m flux density (S_870) limit in the range 9 - 12.5 mJy is in the range\n~630 - 1400 (3600 - 7700) M_sun/yr. The SFR limit implies a correspondingly\nsharp, redshift-dependent cutoff in the stellar mass (M_star) function, the\nvalue of which we predict using the S_870-M_star relation predicted by our\nmodel. The M_star limit decreases with increasing redshift: for an S_870 limit\nof 9 - 12.5 mJy, the M_star limit ranges from ~4 - 7 x 10^12 M_sun at z ~ 1 to\n~3 - 5 x 10^11 M_sun at z ~ 6. We discuss the few interferometrically detected\nSMGs that may be brighter than the proposed cutoff. Although such objects are\ncertainly interesting, inferences based on such objects may not apply to most\nSMGs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Apr 2013 20:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-02"}

The junction conditions across the surface of\na collapsing star are derived under the (minimal) assumption that the junctions\nbe mathematically meaningful in terms of distribution theory. When the\ncollapsing star is made of a homogeneous and isotropic perfect fluid, and the\nexternal region is described by a stationary spacetime, the problem reduces to\nthe matching of six independent conditions. If the perfect fluid is\npressureless (a dust fluid), it is found that the matching is also possible.

Numerous models have been postulated for the nature of these\nevents, including a strong interaction of the shockwave with a dense\ncircumstellar environment, a re-energizing of the outflow via a central engine,\nor an origin in the catastrophic destruction of the star following a loss of\npressure due to pair production in an extremely massive stellar core (so-called\npair instability supernovae). Here we consider constraints that can be placed\non the explosion mechanism of Hydrogen-poor SLSNe (SLSNe-I) via X-ray\nobservations, with XMM-Newton, Chandra and Swift, and show that at least one\nSLSNe-I is likely the brightest X-ray supernovae ever observed, with L_X ~\n10^45 ergs/s, ~150 days after its initial discovery. This is a luminosity 3\norders of magnitude higher than seen in other X-ray supernovae powered via\ncircumstellar interactions. Such high X-ray luminosities are sufficient to\nionize the ejecta and markedly reduce the optical depth, making it possible to\nsee deep into the ejecta and any source of emission that resides there.\nAlternatively, an engine could have powered a moderately relativistic jet\nexternal to the ejecta, similar to those seen in gamma-ray bursts. If the\ndetection of X-rays does require an engine it implies that these SNe do create\ncompact objects, and that the stars are not completely destroyed in a pair\ninstability event. Future observations will determine which, if any, of these\nmechanisms are at play in superluminous supernovae.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Apr 2013 20:08:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

We aim at producing and validating the first\nhigh-performance broadband focal plane phase mask coronagraphs for applications\nin the mid-infrared regime, and in particular the L band with a fractional\nbandwidth of ~16% (3.5-4.1 \\mu m). Based on rigorous coupled wave analysis, we\ndesigned an annular groove phase mask (AGPM) producing a vortex effect in the L\nband, and etched it onto a series of diamond substrates. The grating parameters\nwere measured by means of scanning electron microscopy. The resulting\ncomponents were then tested on a mid-infrared coronagraphic test bench. A\nbroadband raw null depth of 2 x 10^{-3} was obtained for our best L-band AGPM\nafter only a few iterations between design and manufacturing. This corresponds\nto a raw contrast of about 6 x 10^{-5} (10.5 mag) at 2\\lambda/D.

We identify shadow removal as a\ncritical step for improving object detection and tracking. The survey covers\nmethods published during the last decade, and places them in a feature-based\ntaxonomy comprised of four categories: chromacity, physical, geometry and\ntextures. A selection of prominent methods across the categories is compared in\nterms of quantitative performance measures (shadow detection and discrimination\nrates, colour desaturation) as well as qualitative observations. Furthermore,\nwe propose the use of tracking performance as an unbiased approach for\ndetermining the practical usefulness of shadow detection methods. The\nevaluation indicates that all shadow detection approaches make different\ncontributions and all have individual strength and weaknesses. Out of the\nselected methods, the geometry-based technique has strict assumptions and is\nnot generalisable to various environments, but it is a straightforward choice\nwhen the objects of interest are easy to model and their shadows have different\norientation. The chromacity based method is the fastest to implement and run,\nbut it is sensitive to noise and less effective in low saturated scenes. The\nphysical method improves upon the accuracy of the chromacity method by adapting\nto local shadow models, but fails when the spectral properties of the objects\nare similar to that of the background. The small-region texture based method is\nespecially robust for pixels whose neighbourhood is textured, but may take\nlonger to implement and is the most computationally expensive. The large-region\ntexture based method produces the most accurate results, but has a significant\ncomputational load due to its multiple processing steps.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Apr 2013 03:11:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-05"}

Thus it is of crucial importance to design efficient\nalgorithms to perform the change of ordering.\n  The main contributions of this paper are several efficient methods for the\nchange of ordering which take advantage of the sparsity of multiplication\nmatrices in the classical FGLM algorithm. Combing all these methods, we propose\na deterministic top-level algorithm that automatically detects which method to\nuse depending on the input. As a by-product, we have a fast implementation that\nis able to handle ideals of degree over 40000. Such an implementation\noutperforms the Magma and Singular ones, as shown by our experiments.\n  First for the shape position case, two methods are designed based on the\nWiedemann algorithm: the first is probabilistic and its complexity to complete\nthe change of ordering is O(D(N1+nlog(D))), where N1 is the number of nonzero\nentries of a multiplication matrix; the other is deterministic and computes the\nLEX Groebner basis of the radical of I via Chinese Remainder Theorem. Then for\nthe general case, the designed method is characterized by the\nBerlekamp-Massey-Sakata algorithm from Coding Theory to handle the\nmulti-dimensional linearly recurring relations. Complexity analyses of all\nproposed methods are also provided.\n  Furthermore, for generic polynomial systems, we present an explicit formula\nfor the estimation of the sparsity of one main multiplication matrix, and prove\nits construction is free. With the asymptotic analysis of such sparsity, we are\nable to show for generic systems the complexity above becomes $O(\\sqrt{6/n \\pi}\nD^{2+(n-1)/n}})$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Apr 2013 03:50:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-01"}

The\ncelebrated ellipsoid algorithm tells us that the full information of input\nconstraints is not necessary; the algorithm works as long as there exists an\noracle that, on a proposed candidate solution, returns a violation in the\nformat of a separating hyperplane. Can linear programming still be efficiently\nsolved if the returned violation is in other formats?\n  We study this question in a trial-and-error framework: there is an oracle\nthat, upon a proposed solution, returns the index of a violated constraint\n(with the content of the constraint still hidden). When more than one\nconstraint is violated, two variants in the model are investigated. (1) The\noracle returns the index of a \"most violated\" constraint, measured by the\nEuclidean distance of the proposed solution and the half-spaces defined by the\nconstraints. In this case, the LP can be efficiently solved. (2) The oracle\nreturns the index of an arbitrary (i.e., worst-case) violated constraint. In\nthis case, we give an algorithm with running time exponential in the number of\nvariables. We then show that the exponential dependence on n is unfortunately\nnecessary even for the query complexity.

A hallmark method for identifying\nthe presence of ANAs is the Indirect Immunofluorescence method on Human\nEpithelial (HEp-2) cells, due to its high sensitivity and the large range of\nantigens that can be detected. However, the method suffers from numerous\nshortcomings, such as being subjective as well as time and labour intensive.\nComputer Aided Diagnostic (CAD) systems have been developed to address these\nproblems, which automatically classify a HEp-2 cell image into one of its known\npatterns (eg., speckled, homogeneous).

Furthermore with doping another longer range oscillation appears which\narise from the existence of an extended Fermi surface characterized by a single\nmomentum scale $k_F$.

Tidal interactions and accreting gas envelopes can lead to\ncompression and shear motions which enhance the polarized radio continuum\nemission. In addition, galaxies with low average star formation rate per unit\narea have a low average degree of polarization. Shear or compression motions\ncan enhance the degree of polarization. The average degree of polarization of\ntidally interacting galaxies is generally lower than expected for a given\nrotation velocity and star formation activity. This low average degree of\npolarization is at least partly due to the absence of polarized emission from\nthe thin disk. Ram pressure stripping can decrease whereas tidal interactions\nmost frequently decreases the average degree of polarization of Virgo spiral\ngalaxies. We found that moderate active ram pressure stripping has no influence\non the spectral index, but enhances the global radio continuum emission with\nrespect to the FIR emission, while an accreting gas envelope can but not\nnecessarily enhances the radio continuum emission with respect to the FIR\nemission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Apr 2013 09:07:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

The flow structure is\ngeometrically thick, and independent of the gas density and cooling, if the\ncooling time is longer than the viscous timescale (i.e., $t_{\\rm cool} \\gtrsim\nt_{\\rm visc}$). For higher densities, the gas can cool before it can accrete\nand forms the standard geometrically thin, optically thick Shakura-Sunyaev\ndisk. For usual cooling processes (such as bremsstrahlung), we expect an inner\nhot flow and an outer thin disk. For a short cooling time the accretion flow\nseparates into two phases: a radiatively inefficient hot coronal phase and a\ncold thin disk. We argue that there is an upper limit on the density of the hot\ncorona corresponding to a critical value of $t_{\\rm cool}/t_{\\rm ff} (\\sim\n10-100)$, the ratio of the cooling time and the free-fall time.

The transition from a thin disk to a RIAF happens because of mass\nexhaustion due to accretion; the transition happens when the cooling time\nbecomes longer than the viscous time at inner radii. Since the viscous\ntimescale for a geometrically thin disk is quite long, the high-soft state is\nexpected to be long-lived.

One of the major goals of the proposed\nupgrade is to extend the physics reach for rare probes at low transverse\nmomentum. The reconstruction of the rare probes requires a precise\ndetermination of the primary and secondary vertices that is performed in ALICE\nby the Inner Tracking System (ITS). The present ITS made of 6 layers of three\ntechnologies of silicon devices allows, for example, to reconstruct D mesons\nwith the transverse momentum down to ~2 GeV/c.\n  Further extension of this range towards lower pT requires the installation of\nthe new ITS consisting of 7 layers of silicon detectors with significantly\nbetter single point resolution and reduced material budget. It is expected that\nthe new system will allow to improve the impact parameter resolution by a\nfactor of ~3. Moreover, the data rate capability of the upgraded ITS should be\nsignificantly improved in order to exploit the full expected LHC lead-lead\ninteraction rate of 50 kHz, almost two orders of magnitude above the present\nreadout rate.\n  The present contribution describes first the ITS upgrade requirements\nfollowed by the conceptual design of the new system and its expected\nperformance.

We do this for a variety\nof topologically-ordered systems such as the toric code, double semion, color\ncode, and quantum double models. As happens for the entanglement entropy, we\nfind that for sufficiently large block sizes the geometric entanglement is, up\nto possible sub-leading corrections, the sum of two contributions: a bulk\ncontribution obeying a boundary law times the number of blocks, and a\ncontribution quantifying the underlying pattern of long-range entanglement of\nthe topologically-ordered state. This topological contribution is also present\nin the case of single-spin blocks in most cases, and constitutes an alternative\ncharacterisation of topological order for these quantum states based on a\nmultipartite entanglement measure. In particular, we see that the topological\nterm for the 2D color code is twice as much as the one for the toric code, in\naccordance with recent renormalization group arguments. Motivated by this, we\nalso derive a general formalism to obtain upper- and lower-bounds to the\ngeometric entanglement of states with a non-Abelian symmetry, and which we use\nto analyse quantum double models. Furthermore, we also analyse the robustness\nof the topological contribution using renormalization and perturbation theory\narguments, as well as a numerical estimation for small systems.

The glassiness is confirmed by the difference\nbetween the ordering temperature TN ~ Tc inferred from elastic neutron\nscattering and the freezing temperature Tf ~ 11 K obtained from muon spin\nrotation studies. The magnetic field independence of the observed excitation\nspectrum as well as the observation of a partial suppression of magnetic\nspectral weight below 0.75 meV for temperatures smaller than Tf, indicate that\nthe stripe frozen state is capable of supporting a spin anisotropy gap, of a\nmagnitude similar to that observed in the spin and charge stripe ordered ground\nstate of La1.875Ba0.125CuO4.

Strong Nash equilibrium (SNE) refines NE\nto this setting. It is known that finding an SNE is NP-complete when the number\nof agents is constant. This hardness is solely due to the existence of\nmixed-strategy SNEs, given that the problem of enumerating all pure-strategy\nSNEs is trivially in P. Our central result is that, in order for a game to have\nat least one non-pure-strategy SNE, the agents' payoffs restricted to the\nagents' supports must, in the case of 2 agents, lie on the same line, and, in\nthe case of n agents, lie on an (n - 1)-dimensional hyperplane.

We follow the evolution of gas within DM\nhalos of 2 x 10^8 Mo and 1 kpc. We adopt cosmological density profiles and\nj-distributions. Our goal is to understand how the collapsing flow overcomes\nthe centrifugal barrier and whether it is subject to fragmentation. We find\nthat the collapse leads either to a central runaway or to off-center\nfragmentation. A disk-like configuration is formed inside the centrifugal\nbarrier. For more cuspy DM distribution, the gas collapses more and experiences\na bar-like perturbation and a central runaway. We have followed this inflow\ndown to ~10^{-4} pc. The flow remains isothermal and the specific angular\nmomentum is efficiently transferred by gravitational torques in a cascade of\nnested bars. This cascade supports a self-similar, disk-like collapse. In the\ncollapsing phase, virial supersonic turbulence develops and fragmentation is\ndamped. For larger initial DM cores the timescales become longer. In models\nwith more organized initial rotation, a torus forms and appears to be supported\nby turbulent motions. The evolution depends on the competition between two\ntimescales, corresponding to the onset of the central runaway and off-center\nfragmentation. For less organized rotation, the torus is greatly weakened, the\ncentral accretion timescale is shortened, and off-center fragmentation is\nsuppressed --- triggering the central runaway even in previously `stable'\nmodels. The resulting SMBH masses lie in the range 2 x 10^4 Mo - 2 x 10^6 Mo,\nmuch higher than for Population III remnants. We argue that the above upper\nlimit appears to be more realistic mass.

Unfortunately, it is difficult to\ndisentangle the two components and to recover their stellar kinematics in the\nfaint outer parts of the galaxies using conventional absorption line\nspectroscopy. This paper therefore presents the stellar kinematics of six S0\ngalaxies derived from observations of planetary nebulae (PNe), obtained using\nthe Planetary Nebula Spectrograph. To separate the kinematics of the two\ncomponents, we use a maximum-likelihood method that combines the discrete\nkinematic data with a photometric component decomposition. The results of this\nanalysis reveal that: the discs of S0 galaxies are rotationally supported;\nhowever, the amount of random motion in these discs is systematically higher\nthan in comparable spiral galaxies; and the S0s lie around one magnitude below\nthe Tully--Fisher relation for spiral galaxies, while their spheroids lie\nnearly one magnitude above the Faber--Jackson relation for ellipticals. All of\nthese findings are consistent with a scenario in which spirals are converted\ninto S0s through a process of mild harassment or \"pestering,\" with their discs\nsomewhat heated and their spheroid somewhat enhanced by the conversion process.\nIn such a scenario, one might expect the properties of S0s to depend on\nenvironment.

However, the problem with\nit is the vertical clearance needed inside the vacuum chambers for the\nconstruction of numerous, long pendulum stages necessary for effective\nhorizontal vibration isolation. The purpose of this work is to introduce a new\nconcept, called the multi-nested pendula concept, which solves this problem.\nThe attenuation performance of an ideal multistage nested pendula filter is\nbetter than that of an ideal multistage common equal pendula filter by a factor\nof N^{N}, where N is the number of stages used, making this idea of a\nmulti-nested pendula a very interesting one. The initial results (of stability\nand system resonances) measured for a prototype reinforce the viability of the\npractical implementation of such idea. A detailed study for the realization of\na cryogenic and fully operational version to be used in LIGO is going to be\ndone in a future study.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Apr 2013 15:17:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-05"}

The WTS acts as a poor-seeing backup programme for the\ntelescope, and represents the first dedicated wide-field near-infrared transit\nsurvey. In this paper we describe the observing strategy of the WTS and the\nprocessing of the data to generate lightcurves. We describe the basic\nproperties of our photometric data, and measure our sensitivity based on 950\nobservations. We show that the photometry reaches a precision of ~4mmag for the\nbrightest unsaturated stars in lightcurves spanning almost 3 years. Optical\n(SDSS griz) and near-infrared (UKIRT ZYJHK) photometry is used to classify the\ntarget sample of 4600 M dwarfs with J magnitudes in the range 11-17. Most have\nspectral-types in the range M0-M2. We conduct Monte Carlo transit injection and\ndetection simulations for short period (<10 day) Jupiter- and Neptune-sized\nplanets to characterize the sensitivity of the survey. We investigate the\nrecovery rate as a function of period and magnitude for 4 hypothetical\nstar-planet cases: M0-2+Jupiter, M2-4+Jupiter, M0-2+Neptune, M2-4+Neptune. We\nfind that the WTS lightcurves are very sensitive to the presence of\nJupiter-sized short-period transiting planets around M dwarfs. Hot Neptunes\nproduce a much weaker signal and suffer a correspondingly smaller recovery\nfraction. Neptunes can only be reliably recovered with the correct period\naround the rather small sample (~100) of the latest M dwarfs (M4-M9) in the\nWTS.

Estimation of $J_c$ was carried out by an inductive technique, the\nso-called screening technique, in which both the imaginary part of the\nfundamental harmonic of susceptibility $\\chi''_1$ and third harmonic voltage\n$V_3$ criteria were considered for the determination of the full penetration\nfield. In order to verify the reliability of this technique under two criteria,\nwe investigated the homogeneity of $J_c$ via transport measurements conducted\non four microbridges patterned in the same film. Based on the transport method\nwe found that both techniques yield similar results in the determination of\n$J_c$ for temperatures close to critical temperature $T_c$. However, at\ntemperatures relatively far from $T_c$, the $V_3$ criterion showed a better\nagreement with the transport data. Furthermore, using both criteria, we propose\na methodology to estimate in situ the coil factor associated with the $V_3$\ncriterion, avoiding in this way the need of implementing an additional\ntechnique.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Apr 2013 17:33:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-13"}

Following this rotation, gaps of the former\ncase are \"closed\" (in the sense that faces of adjacent tetrahedra are brought\ninto contact to form a \"face junction\") while translational and rotational\nsymmetries are obtained in the latter case. In all cases, an angular\ndisplacement of {\\beta} = arccos((3{\\phi} - 1)/4) (or a closely related angle),\nwhere {\\phi} is the golden ratio, is observed between faces of a junction.\nAdditionally, the overall number of plane classes, defined as the number of\ndistinct facial orientations in the collection of tetrahedra, is reduced\nfollowing the transformation.

A promising approach to develop these\nmechanisms is to specify quantitative privacy requirements at design time\nrather than as an afterthought, and to rely on signal processing techniques to\nachieve satisfying trade-offs between privacy and performance specifications.\nThis paper discusses, from the signal processing point of view, an event stream\nanalysis problem introduced in the database and cryptography literature. A\ndiscrete-valued input signal describes the occurrence of events contributed by\nend-users, and a system is supposed to provide some output signal based on this\ninformation, while preserving the privacy of the participants. The notion of\nprivacy adopted here is that of event-level differential privacy, which\nprovides strong privacy guarantees and has important operational advantages.\nSeveral mechanisms are described to provide differentially private output\nsignals while minimizing the impact on performance. These mechanisms\ndemonstrate the benefits of leveraging system theoretic techniques to provide\nprivacy guarantees for dynamic systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Apr 2013 14:04:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-09"}
