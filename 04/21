Let I be a set of arbitrary\ncardinality (the set of actions) and assume that for each pair of distinct\nactions (i,j), we are given a number \\delta(i,j). We say that a function t,\nspecifying a time for each action, satisfies the timely constraint {\\delta} if\nfor every pair of distinct actions (i,j), we have t(j)-t(i) <= \\delta(i,j) (and\nthus also t(j)-t(i) >= -\\delta(j,i)). While the approach that first comes to\nmind for analysing these definitions is an analytic/geometric one, it turns out\nthat graph-theoretic tools yield powerful results when applied to these\ndefinitions. Using such tools, we characterise the set of satisfiable timely\nconstraints, and reduce the problem of satisfiability of a timely constraint to\nthe all-pairs shortest-path problem, and for finite I, furthermore to the\nnegative-cycle detection problem. Moreover, we constructively show that every\nsatisfiable timely constraint has a minimal satisfying function - a key\nmilestone on the way to optimally solving a large class of coordination\nproblems - and reduce the problem of finding this minimal satisfying function,\nas well as the problems of classifying and comparing timely constraints, to the\nall-pairs shortest-path problem. At the heart of our analysis lies the\nconstructive definition of a \"nicely-behaved\" representative for each class of\ntimely constraints sharing the same set of satisfying functions. We show that\nthis canonical representative, as well as the map from such canonical\nrepresentatives to the the sets of functions satisfying the classes of timely\nconstraints they represent, has many desired properties, which provide deep\ninsights into the structure underlying the above definitions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Apr 2013 16:08:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-23"}

Nonspherical like rectangular structures are of most\ninterest from the standpoint of device development due to fabrication\nconvenience. However, no intuitive fundamental understanding of optical\nresonance in nonspherical structures is available, which has substantially\ndelayed the device development with dielectric materials. Here we elucidate the\ngeneral fundamentals of optical resonances in nonspherical subwavelength\ndielectric structures of different shapes (rectangular or triangular) and\ndimensionalities (1D nanowires and 0D nanoparticles). We demonstrate that the\noptical properties (i.e. light absorption) of nonspherical structures are\ndictated by the eigenvalue of the structure's leaky modes. Leaky modes are\ndefined as natural optical modes with propagating waves outside the structure.\nWe also elucidate the dependence of the eigenvalue on physical features of the\nstructures. The eigenvalue shows scaling invariance with the overall size,\nweakly relies on the refractive index, but linearly depends on the size ratio\nof different sizes of the structure. We propose a modified Fabry-Perot model to\naccount for this linear dependence. Knowledge of the dominant role of leaky\nmodes and the dependence of leaky mode on physical features can serve as a\npowerful guide for the rational design of devices with desired optical\nresonances. It opens up a pathway to design devices with functionality that has\nnot been explored due to lack of intuitive understanding, for instance, imaging\ndevices able to sense incident angle, or superabsorbing photodetectors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Apr 2013 21:17:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-03"}

Using\nrelays, the optimal DoF can be achieved in finite channel uses.

We obtained continuum and line observations\nwith the PACS instrument on board the Herschel Space Observatory and continuum\ndata at 1.2 mm with the IRAM 30m telescope. The SED and line fluxes were\nmodelled using the physico-chemo radiative transfer code ProDiMo. We detected a\nstrong emission by OI at 63 microns using the Herschel Space Observatory. The\n[OI] emission at 145 microns, the [CII] emission at 158 microns, the high-J CO\nemissions, and the warm water emissions were not detected. Continuum emission\nwas detected at 1.2 mm. The continuum from the near- to the far-infrared and\nthe [OI] emission are well explained by the emission from a compact hydrostatic\ndisc model with a gas mass of 5E-6 MSun, 100 times that of the solid mass.\nHowever, this model fails to match the continuum millimeter flux, which hints\nat a cold outer disc with a mass in solids of 1E-6 MSun or free-free emission\nfrom a photoevaporative disc wind. This outer disc can either be devoid of gas\nand/or is to cold to emit in the [OI] line. A very flat extended disc model\n(Rout=400 AU) with a fixed vertical structure and dust settling matches all\nphotometric points and most of the [O I] flux. The observations can be\nexplained by an extended flat disc where dust grains have settled. However, a\nflat gas disc cannot be reproduced by hydrostatic disc models. The low mass of\nthe 51 Oph inner disc in gas and dust may be explained either by the fast\ndissipation of an initial massive disc or by a very small initial disc mass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Apr 2013 10:50:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-22"}

The geomagnetic variations during the solar minima\nare potentially caused by the solar polar field by the connection of the solar\nopen flux. The robust prediction skill of the polar field indicates that the\nmemory of the dynamo process is less than 11 yrs within the framework of the\nBabcock-Leighton flux transport dynamo. One possible reason to get the short\nmagnetic memory is the high magnetic diffusivity in the convective zone. Our\nrecent studies show that the radial downward pumping is another possible\nreason.

In the classical Bodew\\\"adt problem, where the\nswirl tends towards an aysmptotic value away from the wall, the well-known\n\"tea-cup effect\" drives a flow away from the plate at the centre of the vortex.\nSimple dimensional arguments applied to a single vortex show that if the\nintensity of the swirl decreases away from the wall, the sense of the\nrecirculation can be inverted, and that the associated flow rate scales with\nthe swirl gradient.

The license describing these\nuse-conditions typically accompanies the content as its metadata. A resulting\nproblem is that the license and the content can get separated and lose track of\neach other. The best metadata have two distinct qualities--they are created\nautomatically without user intervention, and they are embedded within the data\nthat they describe. If licenses are also created and transported this way, data\nwill always have licenses, and the licenses will be readily examinable. When\ntwo or more datasets are combined, a new dataset, and with it a new license,\nare created. This new license is a function of the licenses of the component\ndatasets and any additional conditions that the person combining the datasets\nmight want to impose. Following the notion of a data-purpose algebra, we model\nthis phenomenon by interpreting the transfer and conjunction of data as\ninducing an algebraic operation on the corresponding licenses. When a dataset\npasses from one source to the next its license is transformed in a\ndeterministic way, and similarly when datasets are combined the associated\nlicenses are combined in a non-trivial algebraic manner. Modern,\ncomputer-savvy, licensing regimes such as Creative Commons allow writing the\nlicense in a special kind of language called Creative Commons Rights Expression\nLanguage (ccREL). ccREL allows creating and embedding the license using RDFa\nutilizing XHTML. This is preferred over DRM which includes the rights in a\nbinary file completely opaque to nearly all users. The colocation of metadata\nwith human-visible XHTML makes the license more transparent. In this paper we\ndescribe a methodology for creating and embedding licenses in geographic data\nutilizing ccREL, and programmatically examining embedded licenses in component\ndata...\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Apr 2013 15:50:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-23"}

We describe a novel method\ncalled rapid quantitative pharmacodynamic imaging. This method combines\npharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling, repeated small doses of a challenge\ndrug over a short time scale, and functional imaging to rapidly provide\nquantitative estimates of drug sensitivity including EC50 (the concentration of\ndrug that produces half the maximum possible effect). We first test the method\nwith simulated data, assuming a typical sigmoidal dose-response curve and\nassuming imperfect imaging that includes artifactual baseline signal drift and\nrandom error. With these few assumptions, rapid quantitative pharmacodynamic\nimaging reliably estimates EC50 from the simulated data, except when noise\noverwhelms the drug effect or when the effect occurs only at high doses. In\npreliminary fMRI studies of primate brain using a dopamine agonist, the\nobserved noise level is modest compared with observed drug effects, and a\nquantitative EC50 can be obtained from some regional time-signal curves. Taken\ntogether, these results suggest that research and clinical applications for\nrapid quantitative pharmacodynamic imaging are realistic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Apr 2013 15:53:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 May 2014 17:41:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 27 May 2014 00:44:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-28"}

We are interested in studying\nprior-free and prior-dependent regret bounds, very much in the same spirit as\nthe usual distribution-free and distribution-dependent bounds for the\nnon-Bayesian stochastic bandit. Building on the techniques of Audibert and\nBubeck [2009] and Russo and Roy [2013] we first show that Thompson Sampling\nattains an optimal prior-free bound in the sense that for any prior\ndistribution its Bayesian regret is bounded from above by $14 \\sqrt{n K}$. This\nresult is unimprovable in the sense that there exists a prior distribution such\nthat any algorithm has a Bayesian regret bounded from below by $\\frac{1}{20}\n\\sqrt{n K}$. We also study the case of priors for the setting of Bubeck et al.\n[2013] (where the optimal mean is known as well as a lower bound on the\nsmallest gap) and we show that in this case the regret of Thompson Sampling is\nin fact uniformly bounded over time, thus showing that Thompson Sampling can\ngreatly take advantage of the nice properties of these priors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Apr 2013 15:58:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Oct 2013 00:48:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-04"}
