If M is an affine projective Osserman manifold,\nthen the modified Riemannian extension metric on the cotangent bundle is both\nspacelike and timelike projective Osserman. Since any rank 1 symmetric space is\naffine projective Osserman, this provides additional information concerning the\ncotangent bundle of a rank 1 Riemannian symmetric space with the modified\nRiemannian extension metric. We construct other examples of affine projective\nOsserman manifolds where the Ricci tensor is not symmetric and thus the\nconnection is not the Levi-Civita connection of any metric. If M is an affine\nprojective Osserman manifold of odd dimension, we use methods of algebraic\ntopology to show the Jacobi operator has only one non-zero eigenvalue and that\neigenvalue is real.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Apr 2013 16:02:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

The HM is conceptualized as an ecological organism that `colonizes' the\nresource zone of the plant cells driven by the potential supplied by the higher\nHM concentration in the substrate. The infinite occupation by the HM is limited\nby the eventual saturation of the cellular binding sites. The solution of the\ndifferential equation results in the logistic equation, the r-K model. The\nmodel is tested for 3 metalophillic plants T.erecta, S. vulgaris and E.\nsplendens growing in different types of substrates, contaminated to varying\nextents by different copper compounds. The model fitted the experimental Cp- Cs\nprofiles well. The r, K parameter values and secondary quantities derived from\nthem, allowed a quantification of the number of Cu binding sites per cell at\nsaturation, the sensitivities (affinities) of these sites for Cu in the 3\nexperimental systems as well as the extraction of information related to the\nsubstrate phyto-availability of the Cu. Thus even though the model operates at\nthe systems level it permits useful insights into underlying processes that\nultimately derive from the cumulative molecular processes of HM homeostasis.\nThe chief advantages of the model are its simplicity, fewer arbitrary\nparameters, and the non-specification of constraints on substrate and plant\ntype.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Apr 2013 18:45:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-30"}

We employ a simple\ncompress-and-forward scheme in which the base-stations(BSs) quantize the\nreceived signals and send the quantized signals to the CP using either\ndistributed Wyner-Ziv coding or single-user compression. The CP decodes the\nquantization codewords first, then decodes the user messages as if the remote\nusers and the cloud center form a virtual multiple-access channel (VMAC). This\npaper formulates the problem of optimizing the quantization noise levels for\nweighted sum rate maximization under a sum backhaul capacity constraint. We\npropose an alternating convex optimization approach to find a local optimum\nsolution to the problem efficiently, and more importantly, establish that\nsetting the quantization noise levels to be proportional to the background\nnoise levels is near optimal for sum-rate maximization when the\nsignal-to-quantization-noise ratio (SQNR) is high. In addition, with Wyner-Ziv\ncoding, the approximate quantization noise level is shown to achieve the\nsum-capacity of the uplink C-RAN model to within a constant gap. With\nsingle-user compression, a similar constant-gap result is obtained under a\ndiagonal dominant channel condition. These results lead to an efficient\nalgorithm for allocating the backhaul capacities in C-RAN. The performance of\nthe proposed scheme is evaluated for practical multicell and heterogeneous\nnetworks. It is shown that multicell processing with optimized quantization\nnoise levels across the BSs can significantly improve the performance of\nwireless cellular networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Apr 2013 19:40:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 Jul 2014 18:00:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 17 Aug 2014 17:49:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-19"}

In this method the standard Kohn-Sham equations of\nDensity-Functional Theory are solved with the constraint of a non-equilibrium\noccupation in a region of Hilbert-space resembling gas-phase orbitals of the\nadsorbate. In this work we discuss the applicability of this method for the\nexcited-state dynamics of metal-surface mounted organic adsorbates,\nspecifically in the context of molecular switching. We present necessary\nadvancements to allow for a consistent quality description of excited-state\npotential-energy surfaces (PESs), and illustrate the concept with the\napplication to Azobenzene adsorbed on Ag(111) and Au(111) surfaces.

While the molecule in gas phase shows a clear\nenergetic separation of resonances that induce isomerization and backreaction,\nthe surface-adsorbed molecule does not. The concomitant possibly simultaneous\ninduction of both processes would lead to a significantly reduced switching\nefficiency of such a mechanism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Apr 2013 20:59:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-23"}

They use the\nalgorithm for PCST to obtain a bicriteria (2, O(log n))-approximation algorithm\nfor the Budgeted node-weighted Steiner tree problem. Their solution may cost up\nto twice the budget, but collects a factor Omega(1/log n) of the optimal prize.\nWe improve these results from at least two aspects.\n  Our first main result is a primal-dual O(log h)-approximation algorithm for a\nmore general problem, prize-collecting node-weighted Steiner forest, where we\nhave (h) demands each requesting the connectivity of a pair of vertices. Our\nalgorithm can be seen as a greedy algorithm which reduces the number of demands\nby choosing a structure with minimum cost-to-reduction ratio.

Through fitting their\nheight evolution with a function consisting of linear and exponential\ncomponents, we determine the onset time of the FR impulsive acceleration with\nhigh temporal accuracy for the first time. Using this onset time, we divide the\nevolution of the FRs in the low corona into two phases: a slow rise phase and\nan impulsive acceleration phase. In the slow rise phase of the FR1, the\nappearance of sporadic EUV and UV brightening and the strong shearing along the\npolarity inverse line indicates that the quasi-separatrix-layer reconnection\nlikely initiates the slow rise. On the other hand for the FR2, we mainly\ncontribute its slow rise to the FR1 eruption, which partially opened the\noverlying field and thus decreased the magnetic restriction. At the onset of\nthe impulsive acceleration phase, the FR1 (FR2) reaches the critical height of\n84.4$\\pm$11.2 Mm (86.2$\\pm$13.0 Mm) where the decline of the overlying field\nwith height is fast enough to trigger the torus instability.

However, in this paper (just as in\n[1]) we focus on lower dimensions -- the 1D lattice of instantons in a harmonic\npotential V M_2^2x_2^2+M_3^2x_2^2+M_4^2x_4^2 and the zigzag-shaped lattice as a\nfirst stage of the 1D->2D transition. We prove that in the low- and\nmoderate-density regimes, interactions between the instantons are dominated by\ntwo-body forces. This drastically simplifies finding the ground state of the\ninstantons' orientations, so we made a numeric scan of the whole orientation\nspace instead of assuming any particular ansatz.\n  We find that depending on the M_2/M_3/M_4 ratios, the ground state of\ninstanton orientations can follow a wide variety of patterns. For the straight\n1D lattices, we found orientations periodically running over elements of a Z_2,\nKlein, prismatic, or dihedral subgroup of the SU(2)/Z_2, as well as irrational\nbut link-periodic patterns. For the zigzag-shaped lattices, we detected 4\ndistinct orientation phases -- the anti-ferromagnet, another abelian phase, and\ntwo non-abelian phases. Allowing the zigzag amplitude to vary as a function of\nincreasing compression force, we obtained the phase diagram for the straight\nand zigzag-shaped lattices in the (force, M_3/M_4), (chemical potential,\nM_3/M_4), and (density, M_3/M_4) planes. Some of the transitions between these\nphases are second-order while others are first-order.\n  Our techniques can be applied to other types of non-abelian crystals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Apr 2013 00:07:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Sep 2013 19:38:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

It has been recently demonstrated that,\nfor hard shapes, entropic forces are directional. A newly proposed theoretical\nframework that defines and quantifies directional entropic forces demonstrates\nthe anisotropic--that is, patchy--nature of these emergent, attractive forces.\nHere we introduce the notion of entropically patchy particles as the entropic\ncounterpart to enthalpically patchy particles. Using three example \"families\"\nof shapes, we judiciously modify entropic patchiness by introducing geometric\nfeatures to the particles so as to target specific crystal structures, which\nthen assembled with Monte Carlo simulations.

It leads to\nmultiply-degenerate ground states, each with a different \"broken\" symmetry\nlabeled by an order parameter. The variation of this order parameter in space\nleads to soliton-like features at the boundaries of different broken-symmetry\nregions and also to topological point defects. Bilayer graphene is a\nfascinating realization of this physics, with an order parameter given by its\ninterlayer stacking coordinate. Bilayer graphene has been a subject of intense\nstudy because in the presence of a perpendicular electric field, a band gap\nappears in its electronic spectrum [1-3] through a mechanism that is intimately\ntied to its broken symmetry. Theorists have further proposed that novel\nelectronic states exist at the boundaries between broken-symmetry stacking\ndomains [4-5]. However, very little is known about the structural properties of\nthese boundaries. Here we use electron microscopy to measure with nanoscale and\natomic resolution the widths, motion, and topological structure of soliton\nboundaries and topological defects in bilayer graphene.

We present the discovery\nreach in the stop--neutralino mass plane for both channels. The latter process\nis sensitive to the stop--higgsino--$b$ quark coupling. This allows us to test\na supersymmetry relation involving superpotential couplings. We briefly comment\non the possible precision with which the coupling can be measured.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Apr 2013 03:39:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-30"}

This paper\ndescribes a finite difference scheme for pricing a TARN option. Key steps in\nthe proposed scheme involve tracking of multiple one-dimensional finite\ndifference solutions, application of jump conditions at each cash flow exchange\ndate, and a cubic spline interpolation of results after each jump. Since a\nfinite difference scheme for TARN has significantly different features from a\ntypical finite difference scheme for options with a path independent payoff, we\ngive a step by step description on the implementation of the scheme, which is\nnot available in the literature. The advantages of the proposed finite\ndifference scheme over the Monte Carlo method are illustrated by examples with\nthree different knockout types. In the case of constant or time dependent\nvolatility models (where Monte Carlo requires simulation at cash flow dates\nonly), the finite difference method can be faster by an order of magnitude than\nthe Monte Carlo method to achieve the same accuracy in price. Finite difference\nmethod can be even more efficient in comparison with Monte Carlo in the case of\nlocal volatility model where Monte Carlo requires significantly larger number\nof time steps. In terms of robust and accurate estimation of Greeks, the\nadvantage of the finite difference method will be even more pronounced.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Apr 2013 05:08:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 Aug 2014 23:26:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-25"}

A standard performance measure is {\\em regret} (loss in payoff) with\nrespect to a set of experts. For example if we measure performance with respect\nto two constant experts one that always predicts 0's and another that always\npredicts 1's it is well known that one can get regret $O(\\sqrt T)$ with respect\nto the best expert by using, say, the weighted majority algorithm.

It is a further step of our earlier\nwork [10] which achieved an elegant algebraic specification theory for\nreal-time systems endowed with the capability to freeze time. In this paper we\nrelinquish such (unrealisable) capability and target more realistic systems\nwithout the ability to stop time.\n  Our theory, in a combined process-algebraic and reactive-synthesis style,\nprovides the operations of parallel composition for system integration, logical\nconjunction/disjunction for viewpoint fusion and independent development, and\nquotient for incremental synthesis.\n  We show that a substitutive refinement preorder, which is a coarsening of the\npre-congruence in [10], constitutes the weakest pre-congruence preserving\nfreedom of incompatibility errors. The coarsening requires a shift in the focus\nof our theory to a more game-theoretical treatment, where the coarsening\nconstitutes a reactive synthesis game named normalisation and is efficiently\nimplementable by a novel local bot-backpropagation algorithm.\n  Previously, timed concurrent games have been studied in [1,14,13], where one\nof the key concern is the removal of time-blocking strategies by applying blame\nassignment [13]. Our timed games also have the issue of time-blocking\nstrategies, which may arise through the composition of specifications. However,\ndue to our distinctively different formulation of timed games, we have\ndiscovered another elegant solution to the problem without blame assignment.\nOur solution utilises a second reactive synthesis game called realisation,\nwhich is dual to normalisation and implementable by the dual local\ntop-backpropagation algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Apr 2013 08:22:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-30"}

The actual character (micro or macroscopic) of\nlinear superpositions in low-spin systems is inherently ill-defined. Here, this\nissue is addressed with specific reference to the Cr7Ni and V15 molecules,\ncharacterized by an S=1/2 ground state. In both cases, the measures we obtain\nare larger than those of a single s=1/2 spin, but not proportionate to the\nnumber and value of the constituent spins.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Apr 2013 11:07:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Sep 2013 14:34:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-18"}

It is also combined with rough surface\nthermal-infrared beaming effects, which have been previously shown to enhance\nthe Yarkovsky-orbital-drift and dampen on average the\nYORP-rotational-acceleration by orders of several tens of per cent. Tests on\nall published concave shape models of near-Earth asteroids, and also on one\nhundred Gaussian-random-spheres, show that the Yarkovsky effect is sensitive to\nshadowing and global self-heating effects at the few per cent level or less.\nFor simplicity, Yarkovsky models can neglect these effects if the level of\naccuracy desired is of this order. Unlike the Yarkovsky effect, the YORP effect\ncan be very sensitive to shadowing and global self-heating effects. Its\nsensitivity increases with decreasing relative strength of the\nYORP-rotational-acceleration, and doesn't appear to depend greatly on the\ndegree of asteroid concavity. Global self-heating tends to produce a vertical\noffset in an asteroid's YORP-rotational-acceleration versus obliquity curve\nwhich is in opposite direction to that produced by shadowing effects. It also\nensures that at least one critical obliquity angle exists at which zero\nYORP-rotational-acceleration occurs. Global self-heating must be included for\naccurate predictions of the YORP effect if an asteroid exhibits a large\nshadowing effect.

We analyse the dependence of the\ncumulative physical uncertainty affecting stellar tracks on the chemical\ncomposition. We calculated more than 6000 stellar tracks and isochrones, with\nmetallicity ranging from Z = 0.0001 to 0.02, by changing the following physical\ninputs within their current range of uncertainty: 1H(p,nu e+)2H,\n14N(p,gamma)15O and triple-alpha reaction rates, radiative and conductive\nopacities, neutrino energy losses, and microscopic diffusion velocities. The\nanalysis was performed using a latin hypercube sampling design. We examine in a\nstatistical way the dependence on the variation of the physical inputs of the\nturn-off (TO) luminosity, the central hydrogen exhaustion time (t_H), the\nluminosity and the helium core mass at the red-giant branch (RGB) tip, and the\nzero age horizontal branch (ZAHB) luminosity in the RR Lyrae region. For the\nstellar tracks, an increase from Z = 0.0001 to Z = 0.02 produces a cumulative\nphysical uncertainty in TO luminosity from 0.028 dex to 0.017 dex, while the\nglobal uncertainty on t_H increases from 0.42 Gyr to 1.08 Gyr. For the RGB tip,\nthe cumulative uncertainty on the luminosity is almost constant at 0.03 dex,\nwhereas the one the helium core mass decreases from 0.0055 M_sun to 0.0035\nM_sun. The dependence of the ZAHB luminosity error is not monotonic with Z, and\nit varies from a minimum of 0.036 dex at Z = 0.0005 to a maximum of 0.047 dex\nat Z = 0.0001.

This has lead to suggestions that the shape\nof the IMF is directly inherited from the shape of the CMF - and therefore, by\nimplication, that there is a self-similar mapping from the CMF onto the IMF. If\nwe assume a self-similar mapping, it follows (i) that F = N0/eta, where eta is\nthe mean fraction of a core's mass that ends up in stars, and N0 is the mean\nnumber of stars spawned by a single core; and (ii) that the stars spawned by a\nsingle core must have an approximately log-normal distribution of relative\nmasses, with universal standard deviation sigma0. Observations can be expected\nto deliver ever more accurate estimates of F, but this still leaves a\ndegeneracy between eta and N0; and sigma0 is also unconstrained by observation.\nHere we show that these parameters can be estimated by invoking binary\nstatistics. Specifically, if (a) each core spawns one long-lived binary system,\nand (b) the probability that a star of mass M is part of this long-lived binary\nis proportional to M^alpha, current observations of the binary frequency as a\nfunction of primary mass and the distribution of mass ratios strongly favour\neta = 1.0 +/- 0.3, N0 = 4.3 +/- 0.4, sigma0 = 0.3 +/- 0.03 and alpha = 0.9 +/-\n0.6. The mapping from CMF to IMF is not necessarily self-similar - there are\nmany possible motivations for a non self-similar mapping - but if it is not,\nthen the shape of the IMF cannot be inherited from the CMF. Given the limited\nobservational constraints currently available and the ability of a self-similar\nmapping to satisfy them, the possibility that the shape of the IMF is inherited\nfrom the CMF cannot be ruled out at this juncture.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Apr 2013 14:16:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-07"}

Consider a line segment $[0,I]$ and a set of\n$n$ mobile robots $r_1,r_2,..., r_n$ placed at one of its endpoints. Each robot\nhas a {\\em searching speed} $s_i$ and a {\\em walking speed} $w_i$, where $s_i\n<w_i$. We assume that each robot is aware of the number of robots of the\ncollection and their corresponding speeds. At each time moment a robot $r_i$\neither walks along a portion of the segment not exceeding its walking speed\n$w_i$ or searches a portion of the segment with the speed not exceeding $s_i$.\nA search of segment $[0,I]$ is completed at the time when each of its points\nhave been searched by at least one of the $n$ robots. We want to develop {\\em\nmobility schedules} (algorithms) for the robots which complete the search of\nthe segment as fast as possible. More exactly we want to maximize the {\\em\nspeed} of the mobility schedule (equal to the ratio of the segment length\nversus the time of the completion of the schedule).\n  We analyze first the offline scenario when the robots know the length of the\nsegment that is to be searched. We give an algorithm producing a mobility\nschedule for arbitrary walking and searching speeds and prove its optimality.\nThen we propose an online algorithm, when the robots do not know in advance the\nactual length of the segment to be searched. The speed $S$ of such algorithm is\ndefined as $S = \\inf_{I_L} S(I_L)$ where $S(I_L)$ denotes the speed of\nsearching of segment $I_L=[0,L]$. We prove that the proposed online algorithm\nis 2-competitive. The competitive ratio is shown to be better in the case when\nthe robots' walking speeds are all the same.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Apr 2013 15:48:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-30"}

A hemispheric\nasymmetry in periodicities of the photospheric fields was seen only at\nlatitudes above $\\pm45{^{\\circ}}$ when the data was divided, based on a wavelet\nanalysis, into two parts: one prior to 1996 and the other after 1996.\nFurthermore, the hemispheric asymmetry was observed to be confined to the\nlatitude range 45${^{\\circ}}$ to 60${^{\\circ}}$. This can be attributed to the\nvariations in polar surges that primarily depend on both the emergence of\nsurface magnetic flux and varying solar surface flows. The observed asymmetry\nwhen coupled with the fact that both solar fields above $\\pm45{^{\\circ}}$ and\nmicro-turbulence levels in the inner-heliosphere have been decreasing since the\nearly to mid nineties (Janardhan et al., 2011) suggests that around this time\nactive changes occurred in the solar dynamo that governs the underlying basic\nprocesses in the sun. These changes in turn probably initiated the build-up to\nthe very deep solar minimum at the end of the cycle 23. The decline in fields\nabove $\\pm45{^{\\circ}}$ for well over a solar cycle, would imply that weak\npolar fields have been generated in the past two successive solar cycles\n\\textit{viz.} cycles 22 and 23. A continuation of this declining trend beyond\n22 years, if it occurs, will have serious implications on our current\nunderstanding of the solar dynamo.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Apr 2013 16:04:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

We focus on the magnetic twist in four flare events, M6.6, X2.2, M1.0,\nand M1.1. The magnetic twist is estimated from the nonlinear force-free field\nextrapolated from the vector fields obtained from the Helioseismic and Magnetic\nImager on board the Solar Dynamic Observatory using magnetohydrodynamic\nrelaxation method developed by \\cite{2011ApJ...738..161I}. We found that\nstrongly twisted lines ranging from half-turn to one-turn twist were built up\njust before the M6.6- and X2.2 flares and disappeared after that. Because most\nof the twist remaining after these flares was less than half-turn twist, this\nresult suggests that the buildup of magnetic twist over the half-turn twist is\na key process in the production of large flares. On the other hand, even though\nthese strong twists were also built up just before the M1.0 and M1.1 flares,\nmost of them remained afterwords. Careful topological analysis before the M1.0\nand M1.1 flares shows that the strongly twisted lines were surrounded mostly by\nthe weakly twisted lines formed in accordance with the clockwise motion of the\npositive sunspot, whose footpoints are rooted in strong magnetic flux regions.\nThese results imply that these weakly twisted lines might suppress the activity\nof the strongly twisted lines in the last two M-class flares.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Apr 2013 08:43:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}
