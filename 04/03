We aim at a multi-wavelength characterization of PLCK\nG004.5$-$19.5, one of the most massive X-ray validated SZ effect-selected\ngalaxy clusters discovered by the Planck satellite.

This paper shows that several properties of the Crab are best\nsuited to Type IIn-P explosions (Type IIn spectra with plateau light curves).\nThese events probably arise from relatively low-energy (1e50 erg) explosions\nwith low 56Ni yield resulting from electron-capture SNe (ecSNe), but their high\nluminosity and Type IIn spectra are dominated by shock interaction with CSM.\nAfter about 120 days, nearly all of the mass in the CSM and ejecta ends up in a\nslow dense shell. In the scenario proposed here for SN1054, this thin shell is\naccelerated by the growing pulsar wind nebula, producing the complex network of\nfilaments seen today. There is no need to invoke the invisible fast SN envelope\nhypothesized to reside outside the Crab. SNeIIn-P explain several observed\nfeatures of the Crab: (1) No blast wave or rapidly expanding SN envelope\noutside the filaments, (2) a total mass of 5 Msun swept up in a thin shell, (3)\na high peak luminosity despite the low kinetic energy, and (4) chemical\nabundances consistent with an 8-10 Msun star and low 56Ni yield.

Joint probability density functions (PDFs) of the invariants of\ngradient quantities related to the velocity and the magnetic fields demonstrate\nthat structures and dynamics at the time of maximum dissipation depend on the\nlarge scale initial conditions. This is evident in particular from the fact\nthat each flow has a different shape for the joint PDF of the invariants of the\nvelocity gradient in contrast to the universal teardrop shape of hydrodynamic\nturbulence. The general picture that emerges from the analysis of the\ninvariants is that regions of high vorticity are correlated with regions of\nhigh strain rate $\\bm S$ also in contrast to hydrodynamic turbulent flows.\nMagnetic strain dominated regions are also well correlated with region of high\ncurrent density $\\bm j$.

Previous studies of\nperturbations, performed in the decoupling limit, revealed one healthy scalar\nmode, while the second relevant scalar was not captured in that limit.

Our main result is the following structural theorem: any\nsubmodular function is $\\epsilon$-close in $\\ell_2$ to a real-valued decision\ntree (DT) of depth $O(1/\\epsilon^2)$. This immediately implies that any\nsubmodular function is $\\epsilon$-close to a function of at most\n$2^{O(1/\\epsilon^2)}$ variables and has a spectral $\\ell_1$ norm of\n$2^{O(1/\\epsilon^2)}$. It also implies the closest previous result that states\nthat submodular functions can be approximated by polynomials of degree\n$O(1/\\epsilon^2)$ (Cheraghchi et al., 2012).

A rare subclass of SNe Ia\nshow evidence of strong interaction with their circumstellar medium (CSM), and\nin particular, a hydrogen-rich CSM; we refer to them as SNe Ia-CSM. In the\nfirst systematic search for such systems, we have identified 16 SNe Ia-CSM, and\nhere we present new spectra of 13 of them. Six SNe Ia-CSM have been\nwell-studied previously, three were previously known but are analyzed in-depth\nfor the first time here, and seven are new discoveries from the Palomar\nTransient Factory. The spectra of all SNe Ia-CSM are dominated by H{\\alpha}\nemission (with widths of ~2000 km/s) and exhibit large H{\\alpha}/H{\\beta}\nintensity ratios (perhaps due to collisional excitation of hydrogen via the SN\nejecta overtaking slower-moving CSM shells); moreover, they have an almost\ncomplete lack of He I emission. They also show possible evidence of dust\nformation through a decrease in the red wing of H{\\alpha} 75-100 d past maximum\nbrightness, and nearly all SNe Ia-CSM exhibit strong Na I D absorption from the\nhost galaxy. The absolute magnitudes (uncorrected for host-galaxy extinction)\nof SNe Ia-CSM are found to be -21.3 <= M_R <= -19 mag, and they also seem to\nshow ultraviolet emission at early times and strong infrared emission at late\ntimes (but no detected radio or X-ray emission). Finally, the host galaxies of\nSNe Ia-CSM are all late-type spirals similar to the Milky Way, or dwarf\nirregulars like the Large Magellanic Cloud, which implies that these objects\ncome from a relatively young stellar population.

This formalism is a\nuseful tool for describing at the same time the mass function (MF) of dark\nhaloes, their mass aggregation histories (MAHs) and merging rates (MRs). The CF\nfocuses on virialized regions in a self-consistent way rather than in mass\nelements, and it offers an economical description for a variety of random\nfields. Within the framework of the CF, we confirm that, for a Gaussian field,\nit is not possible to reproduce at the same time the MF, MAH, and MR of haloes,\nboth for a constant and moving barrier. Then, we develop an inductive method\nfor constraining the cumulative conditional probability from a given halo MF\ndescription, and thus, using the CF, we calculate the halo MAHs and MRs. By\napplying this method to the MF measured in numerical simulations by Tinker et\nal. 2008, we find that a reasonable solution, justified by a mass conservation\nargument, is obtained if ones introduce a rescaling -increment by ~30% - of the\nvirial mass used in simulations and a (slight) deviation from Gaussianity.\nThus, both the MAH and MR obtained by a Monte Carlo merger tree agree now with\nthe predictions of numerical simulations. We discuss on the necessity of\nrescaling the virial mass in simulations when comparing with analytical\napproaches on the ground of the matter not accounted as part of the halos and\nthe halo mass limit due to numerical.

We discuss briefly the collider\nphenomenology with a particular focus on the next to lightest supersymmetric\nparticle in which this model offers the sneutrino as an additional possiblity.\nMoreover, we point out that, also in this model variant, supersymmetry can be\ndiscovered in Z' decays even in scenarios in which the strongly interacting\nparticles are too heavy to be produced at a sizable rate at the LHC with 14\nTeV. In addition, we show that lepton flavor violating observables constrain\nthe size of the neutrino Yukawa couplings for which, in particular, muon decays\nand \\mu-e conversion in heavy atoms are of particular importance. Once these\nconstraints are fulfilled the rates for \\tau decays are predicted to be below\nthe reach of near-future experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Apr 2013 20:00:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 Jul 2013 10:21:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-06"}

This is due mostly to the lower initial\ntemperatures, which leads to a much more modest increase in density before the\natomic cooling limit is reached, making subsequent molecular cooling much less\nefficient.\n  Finally, we study how the gravitational potential from a nearby dwarf galaxy\naffects the collapse of the filament and compare this to NGC 5253, a nearby\nstarbusting dwarf galaxy thought to be fueled by the accretion of filament gas.\nIn contrast to our fiducial case, a substantial density peak forms at the\ncenter of the potential.

Performance of conventional\nspectrum detection methods is severely limited when the average SNR of the\nfading channel between the PU transmitter and the SU sensor is low. Cooperative\nsensing and advanced detection techniques only partially remedy this problem. A\nkey limitation of conventional approaches is that the sensing threshold is\ndetermined from the miss detection rate averaged over the fading distribution.\nIn this paper, the threshold is adapted to the instantaneous PU-to-SU Channel\nState Information (CSI) under the prescribed collision probability constraint,\nand a novel sensing strategy design is proposed for overlay CR network where\nthe instantaneous false alarm probability is incorporated into the belief\nupdate and the reward computation.

Metal absorption lines of Fe II, Mg\nII, and Mg I in the halo of NGC 891 are clearly seen, and when combined with\nrecent deep H I observations, we are able to place constraints on the\nmetallicity of the halo gas for the first time.

The red\n(metal-rich) GC subpopulations show strong alignment with the major axis of the\nhost galaxy, which supports the notion that these GCs are associated with\nmetal-rich field stars. The metal-rich GCs in lenticular galaxies show signs of\nbeing more strongly associated with disks rather than bulges.

Even though in the continuum\nflow regime, both models can give the same Navier-Stokes equations with correct\nPrandtl number, their modification of the collision term may have different\ndynamic effect in the non-equilibrium transition flow regimes. With the\nintroduction of one free parameter, a generalized kinetic model with the\ncombination of the ES-model and S-model can be developed, and this new model\ncan get the correct Navier-Stokes equations in the continuum flow regime as\nwell, but with abundant dynamic effect through the adjustment of the new degree\nof freedom.

The physical performance of the new model with the variation of the free\nparameter has been tested, where the ES-model and S-model become the limiting\ncases.

Based on\nscanning force microscopy imaging and optical trap-driven unzipping assays, it\nhas recently been suggested that DNA compaction may result from the\nantagonistic effects of H-NS binding to DNA in trans and cis configurations. In\norder to get more insight into the compaction mechanism, we constructed a\ncoarse-grained model description of the compaction of bacterial DNA by H-NS.\nThese simulations highlight the fact that DNA compaction indeed results from\nthe subtle equilibrium between several competing factors, which include the\ndeformation dynamics of the plasmid and the several binding modes of protein\ndimers to DNA, i.e. dangling configurations, cis- and trans-binding. In\nparticular, the degree of compaction is extremely sensitive to the difference\nin binding energies of the cis and trans configurations.

In accord with simulations and previous findings,\ncoexistence between the two competing states/opinions turns out to be strongly\nfavored by disorder in the standard voter model; actually, a disorder-induced\nphase transition is generated for any finite system size in the presence of an\narbitrary small spontaneous-inversion rate (preventing absorbing states from\nbeing stable). For non-linear versions of the voter model a general theory (by\nAlHammal et al.) explains that the spontaneous breaking of the up/down symmetry\nand an absorbing state phase transition can occur either together or\nseparately, giving raise to two different scenarios. Here, we show that he\npresence of quenched disorder in non-linear voter models does not allow the\nseparation of the up-down (Ising-like) symmetry breaking from the\nactive-to-absorbing phase transition in low-dimensional systems: both phenomena\ncan occur only simultaneously, as a consequence of the well-known Imry-Ma\nargument generalized to these non-equilibrium problems.
