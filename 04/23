In the strict tunneling\nregime, the electron response to the optical field is said to be adiabatic, and\nnonadiabatic effects are assumed to be negligible. Here, we investigate to what\ndegree this terminology is consistent with a language based on the so-called\nadiabatic representation. This representation is commonly used in various\nfields of physics. For electronically bound states, the adiabatic\nrepresentation yields discrete potential energy curves that are connected by\nnonadiabatic transitions. When applying the adiabatic representation to optical\nstrong-field ionization, a conceptual challenge is that the eigenstates of the\ninstantaneous Hamiltonian form a continuum; i.e., there are no discrete\nadiabatic states. This difficulty can be overcome by applying an\nanalytic-continuation technique. In this way, we obtain a rigorous\nclassification of adiabatic states and a clear characterization of\n(non)adiabatic and (non)diabatic ionization dynamics. Moreover, we distinguish\ntwo different regimes within tunneling ionization and explain the dependence of\nthe ionization probability on the pulse envelope.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Apr 2013 16:05:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-23"}

The sample we observed consists of the\nfollowing sources: the semi-regular variable RT Vir and the Mira variables AP\nLyn, IK Tau, and IRC+60370. We observed the 6$_{1,6}-5_{2,3}$ H$_2$O maser\nrotational transition, in full-polarization mode, to determine its linear and\ncircular polarization. Based on the Zeeman effect, one can infer the properties\nof the magnetic field from the maser polarization analysis. We detected a total\nof 238 maser features, in three of the four observed sources. No masers were\nfound toward AP Lyn. The observed masers are all located between 2.4 and 53.0\nAU from the stars. Linear and circular polarization was found in 18 and 11\nmaser features, respectively. We more than doubled the number of AGB stars in\nwhich magnetic field has been detected from H$_2$O maser polarization, as our\nresults confirm the presence of fields around IK Tau, RT Vir and IRC+60370. The\nstrength of the field along the line of sight is found to be between 47 and 331\nmG in the H$_2$O maser region. Extrapolating this result to the surface of the\nstars, assuming a toroidal field ($\\propto$ r$^{-1}$), we find magnetic fields\nof 0.3-6.9 G on the stellar surfaces. If, instead of a toroidal field, we\nassume a poloidal field ($\\propto$ r$^{-2}$), then the extrapolated magnetic\nfield strength on the stellar surfaces are in the range between 2.2 and\n$\\sim$115 G. Finally, if a dipole field ($\\propto$ r$^{-3}$) is assumed, the\nfield strength on the surface of the star is found to be between 15.8 and\n$\\sim$1945 G. The magnetic energy of our sources is higher than the thermal and\nkinetic energy in the H$_2$O maser region of this class of objects. This leads\nus to conclude that, indeed, magnetic fields probably play an important role in\nshaping the outflows of evolved stars.

This makes its complexity a fundamental problem in\ncomputer science. Depending on the context, solving has different meanings. In\norder to stick to the most general case, we consider a representation of the\nsolutions from which one can easily recover the exact solutions or a certified\napproximation of them. Under generic assumption, such a representation is given\nby the lexicographical Gr\\\"obner basis of the system and consists of a set of\nunivariate polynomials. The best known algorithm for computing the\nlexicographical Gr\\\"obner basis is in $\\widetilde{O}(d^{3n})$ arithmetic\noperations where $n$ is the number of variables and $d$ is the maximal degree\nof the equations in the input system. The notation $\\widetilde{O}$ means that\nwe neglect polynomial factors in $n$. We show that this complexity can be\ndecreased to $\\widetilde{O}(d^{\\omega n})$ where $2 \\leq \\omega < 2.3727$ is\nthe exponent in the complexity of multiplying two dense matrices. Consequently,\nwhen the input polynomial system is either generic or reaches the B\\'ezout\nbound, the complexity of solving a polynomial system is decreased from\n$\\widetilde{O}(D^3)$ to $\\widetilde{O}(D^\\omega)$ where $D$ is the number of\nsolutions of the system.

Localizing an\narbitrary triangulated $C$ by a set $S$ of morphisms in the heart of a weight\nstructure $w$ for it one obtains a triangulated category endowed with a weight\nstructure $w'$. The heart of $w'$ is a certain idempotent completion of the\nnon-commutative localization of the heart of $w$ by $S$. The latter is the\nnatural categorical version of Cohn's localizations of rings i.e. the functor\nconnecting hearts is universal among all the additive functors that make the\nelements of $S$ invertible.

In particular, we have studied the\nstructural properties of those disks with a broken or down-bending profile. We\nfind that, on average, disks with a genuine single exponential profile have a\nscale-length and a central surface brightness which are intermediate to those\nof the inner and outer components of a down-bending disk with the same total\nstellar mass. In the case of barred galaxies, the ratio between the break and\nthe bar radii (Rbr/Rbar) depends strongly on the total stellar mass of the\ngalaxy. For galaxies more massive than 10^10 Msun, the distribution is bimodal,\npeaking at Rbr/Rbar~2 and ~3.5. The first peak, which is the most populated\none, is linked to the Outer Lindblad Resonance of the bar, whereas the second\none is consistent with a dynamical coupling between the bar and the spiral\npattern. For galaxies below 10^10 Msun, breaks are found up to ~10 Rbar, but we\nshow that they could still be caused by resonances given the rising nature of\nrotation curves in these low-mass disks. While not ruling out star formation\nthresholds, our results imply that radial stellar migration induced by\nnon-axysymmetric features can be responsible not only for those breaks at 2\nRbar, but also for many of those found at larger radii.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Apr 2013 20:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

In the field of\ncomputational anatomy, the framework of currents has indeed proved very\nefficient to model a wide variety of shapes. However, in such approaches,\norientation of shapes is a fundamental issue that can lead to several drawbacks\nin treating certain kind of datasets. More specifically, problems occur with\nstructures like acute pikes because of canceling effects of currents or with\ndata that consists in many disconnected pieces like fiber bundles for which\ncurrents require a consistent orientation of all pieces. As a promising\nalternative to currents, varifolds, introduced in the context of geometric\nmeasure theory by F. Almgren, allow the representation of any non-oriented\nmanifold (more generally any non-oriented rectifiable set). In particular, we\nexplain how varifolds can encode numerically non-oriented objects both from the\ndiscrete and continuous point of view. We show various ways to build a Hilbert\nspace structure on the set of varifolds based on the theory of reproducing\nkernels. We show that, unlike the currents' setting, these metrics are\nconsistent with shape volume (theorem 4.1) and we derive a formula for the\nvariation of metric with respect to the shape (theorem 4.2). Finally, we\npropose a generalization to non-oriented shapes of registration algorithms in\nthe context of Large Deformations Metric Mapping (LDDMM), which we detail with\na few examples in the last part of the paper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Apr 2013 21:03:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-09"}

Recent experiments at Belle and BaBar take advantage of quantum\nentanglement and the correlations in the time evolution of the product\nparticles to study CP and T violations. If one (or more) of the product\nparticles are not observed, their degrees of freedom are traced out of the pure\nstate density matrix resulting from the decay, leading to a mixed state density\nmatrix and an entanglement entropy. This entropy is a measure of the loss of\ninformation present in the original quantum correlations of the entangled\nstate. We use the Wigner-Weisskopf method to construct an approximation to this\nstate that evolves in time in a {\\em manifestly unitary} way. We then obtain\nthe entanglement entropy from the reduced density matrix of one of the daughter\nparticles obtained by tracing out the unobserved states, and follow its time\nevolution. We find that it grows over a time scale determined by the lifetime\nof the parent particle to a maximum, which when the width of the parent\nparticle is narrow, describes the phase space distribution of maximally\nentangled Bell-like states.

For comparison, an equivalent analysis is applied to the Pacific Decadal\nOscillation (PDO) index and to the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO)\nindex. Finally, a global reconstruction of sea level and a reconstruction of\nthe North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index are analyzed and compared: both\nsequences cover about three centuries from 1700 to 2000. The proposed\nmethodology quickly highlights oscillations and teleconnections among the\nrecords at the decadal and multidecadal scales. At the secular time scales tide\ngauge records present relatively small (positive or negative) accelerations, as\nfound in other studies. On the contrary, from the decadal to the secular scales\n(up to 110-year intervals) the tide gauge accelerations oscillate significantly\nfrom positive to negative values mostly following the PDO, AMO and NAO\noscillations. In particular, the influence of a large quasi 60-70 year natural\noscillation is clearly demonstrated in these records. The multiscale dynamical\nevolutions of the rate and of the amplitude of the annual seasonal cycle of the\nchosen six tide gauge records are also studied.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Apr 2013 01:57:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-24"}

In the inverse seesaw scenario, the smallness of neutrino masses is\nlinked to the smallness of a lepton number violating parameter. This parameter\nmay arise radiatively. In this paper, we study the cosmological implications of\ntwo contrasting radiative inverse seesaw models, one due to Ma and the other to\nLaw and McDonald. The former features spontaneous, the latter explicit lepton\nnumber violation. First, we examine the effect of the lepton-number violating\ninteractions introduced in these models on the baryon asymmetry of the\nuniverse. We investigate under what conditions a pre-existing baryon asymmetry\ndoes not get washed out. While both models allow a baryon asymmetry to survive\nonly once the temperature has dropped below the mass of their heaviest fields,\nthe Ma model can create the baryon asymmetry through resonant leptogenesis.\nThen we investigate the viability of the dark matter candidates arising within\nthese models, and explore the prospects for direct detection. We find that the\nLaw/McDonald model allows a simple dark matter scenario similar to the Higgs\nportal, while in the Ma model the simplest cold dark matter scenario would tend\nto overclose the universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Apr 2013 04:05:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Aug 2013 04:52:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-09"}

Applying the first and second principles\nof thermodynamics, one can determine their cooling rate, luminosity, and\ntemperature at a given age. Measurements of Saturn's infrared intrinsic\nluminosity, however, reveal that this planet is significantly brighter than\npredicted for its age. This excess luminosity is usually attributed to the\nimmiscibility of helium in the hydrogen-rich envelope, leading to \"rains\" of\nhelium-rich droplets. Existing evolution calculations, however, suggest that\nthe energy released by this sedimentation process may not be sufficient to\nresolve the puzzle. Here, we demonstrate using planetary evolution models that\nthe presence of layered convection in Saturn's interior, generated, like in\nsome parts of Earth oceans, by the presence of a compositional gradient,\nsignificantly reduces its cooling. It can explain the planet's present\nluminosity for a wide range of configurations without invoking any additional\nsource of energy. This suggests a revision of the conventional homogeneous\nadiabatic interior paradigm for giant planets, and questions our ability to\nassess their heavy element content. This reinforces the possibility for layered\nconvection to help explaining the anomalously large observed radii of\nextrasolar giant planets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Apr 2013 07:20:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-24"}

The scatter of the cluster TFR increases\nfor galaxies closer to the core region, also indicating an environmental\neffect. Interestingly, dusty red galaxies become fainter towards the core at\ngiven rotation velocity (i.e. total mass). This indicates that the star\nformation in these galaxies is in the process of being quenched. The\nluminosities of normal spiral galaxies are slightly higher at fixed rotation\nvelocity for smaller cluster-centric radii. Probably these galaxies are\ngas-rich (compared to the dusty red population) and the onset of ram-pressure\nstripping increases their star-formation rates.

In spite of\nthese efforts several aspects of its phase diagram remain unexplained. Here we\nuse atomistic simulations to characterize the polymorphic phase diagram of Cu\nprecipitates in body-centered cubic (BCC) Fe and establish a consistent link\nbetween their thermodynamic and mechanical properties in terms of thermal\nstability, shape, and strength. The size at which Cu precipitates transform\nfrom BCC to a close-packed 9R structure is found to be strongly temperature\ndependent, ranging from approximately 4 nm in diameter (~2,700 atoms) at 200 K\nto about 8 nm (~22,800 atoms) at 700 K. These numbers are in very good\nagreement with the interpretation of experimental data given Monzen et al.\n[Phil. Mag. A 80, 711 (2000)]. The strong temperature dependence originates\nfrom the entropic stabilization of BCC Cu, which is mechanically unstable as a\nbulk phase. While at high temperatures the transition exhibits first-order\ncharacteristics, the hysteresis, and thus the nucleation barrier, vanish at\ntemperatures below approximately 300\\,K. This behavior is explained in terms of\nthe mutual cancellation of the energy differences between core and shell\n(wetting layer) regions of BCC and 9R nanoprecipitates, respectively. The\nproposed mechanism is not specific for the Fe--Cu system but could generally be\nobserved in immiscible systems, whenever the minority component is unstable in\nthe lattice structure of the host matrix.

Every job $j$ has a processing\ntime $p_j$ and a priority weight $w_j$, and for a given schedule a completion\ntime $C_j$. In this paper we consider the problem of minimizing the objective\nvalue $\\sum_j w_j C_j^\\beta$ for some fixed constant $\\beta>0$. This\nnon-linearity is motivated for example by the learning effect of a machine\nimproving its efficiency over time, or by the speed scaling model. For\n$\\beta=1$, the well-known Smith's rule that orders job in the non-increasing\norder of $w_j/p_j$ give the optimum schedule. However, for $\\beta \\neq 1$, the\ncomplexity status of this problem is open. Among other things, a key issue here\nis that the ordering between a pair of jobs is not well-defined, and might\ndepend on where the jobs lie in the schedule and also on the jobs between them.\nWe investigate this question systematically and substantially generalize the\npreviously known results in this direction. These results lead to interesting\nnew dominance properties among schedules which lead to huge speed up in exact\nalgorithms for the problem.

However, little attention has been devoted thus far to incorporating\nexternal information in clinical trials with binary outcomes, perhaps due to\nthe perception that binary outcomes can be treated as normally-distributed\noutcomes by using normal approximations. In this paper we show that these two\ntypes of clinical trials could behave differently, and that special care is\nneeded for the analysis of clinical trials with binary outcomes. In particular,\nwe first examine a simple but commonly used univariate Bayesian approach and\nobserve a technical flaw. We then study the full Bayesian approach using\ndifferent beta priors and a new frequentist approach based on the notion of\nconfidence distribution (CD). These approaches are illustrated and compared\nusing data from clinical studies and simulations. The full Bayesian approach is\ntheoretically sound, but surprisingly, under skewed prior distributions, the\nestimate derived from the marginal posterior distribution may not fall between\nthose from the marginal prior and the likelihood of clinical trial data. This\ncounterintuitive phenomenon, which we call the \"discrepant posterior\nphenomenon,\" does not occur in the CD approach. The CD approach is also\ncomputationally simpler and can be applied directly to any prior distribution,\nsymmetric or skewed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Apr 2013 08:47:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-24"}

The present\nwork involves the comparison of this standard bulk with a relatively less used\nbulk Micromegas detector having a larger amplification gap of 192 micron.\nDetector gain, energy resolution and electron transparency of these Micromegas\nhave been measured under different conditions in various argon based gas\nmixtures to evaluate their performance. These measured characteristics have\nalso been compared in detail to numerical simulations using the Garfield\nframework that combines packages such as neBEM, Magboltz and Heed.

Our analysis shows\nthat the brightness of PV Cep is fading, as well as the mass accretion rate\n(2x10^-7 Msun/yr^-1 in 2012 vs ~5x10^-6 Msun/yr^-1 in 2004), which is more than\none order of magnitude lower than in the outburst phase. Among the several\nemission lines, only the [FeII] intensity increased after the outburst. The\nobserved [FeII] emission delineates blue- and red-shifted lobes, both with\nhigh- and low-velocity components, which trace an asymmetric jet and wind,\nrespectively. The observed emission in the jet has a dynamical age of ~8 years,\nindicating that it was produced during the last outburst. The mass ejection\nrate in both lobes is 1.5x10^-7 Msun/yr^-1, approximately matching the high\naccretion rate observed during and immediately after the outburst .

In the context of the\nrecently developed theory of compressive sensing (CS), it is often assumed that\nthe signal of interest is sparse in an orthonormal basis. However, in many\npractical applications, this requirement may be too restrictive. A\ngeneralization of the standard sparsity assumption is that the signal lies in a\nunion of subspaces. Recovery of such signals from a small number of samples has\nbeen studied recently in several works. Here, we consider the problem of\nsubspace recovery in which our goal is to identify the subspace (from the\nunion) in which the signal lies using a small number of samples, in the\npresence of noise. More specifically, we derive performance bounds and\nconditions under which reliable subspace recovery is guaranteed using maximum\nlikelihood (ML) estimation. We begin by treating general unions and then obtain\nthe results for the special case in which the subspaces have structure leading\nto block sparsity.

In this paper, we characterize the complexity of model-checking problems\non flat counter systems for the specification languages including first-order\nlogic, linear mu-calculus, infinite automata, and related formalisms. Our\nresults span different complexity classes (mainly from PTime to PSpace) and\nthey apply to languages in which arithmetical constraints on counter values are\nsystematically allowed.

Its evaluation inside continuous media from Newton's law is known to\nbe challenging because of the diverging kernel 1/|r-r'|. This difficulty is\ngenerally treated with avoidance techniques (e.g. multipole expansions,\nsoftening length) themselves not without drawbacks. In this article, we present\na new path that basically fixes the point-mass singularity problem in systems\nwith, at least, two dimensions. It consists of recasting the gravitational\npotential in an equivalent integro-differential form, namely the\ncross-derivative of a \"hyperpotential\" (i.e., an auxiliary scalar function). In\ncontrast with the potential, the hyperpotential is the convolution of the mass\ndensity with a finite amplitude kernel. We show that closed-form expressions\nfor this new kernel can be directly deduced from the potential of homogeneous\nsheets. We then give a few formulae appropriate to the Cartesian, cylindrical\nand spherical coordinate systems, including axial symmetry. The method is\nessentially not limited, either on the geometry of the source or on the\ndistribution, and its implementation is straightforward. Several tests based\nupon simple quadrature/differentiation schemes are presented (the homogeneous\nrectangular sheet, cuboid and disk, the Maclaurin disk and a truncated\nLane-Emden solution). Compared with a direct summation, the extra computational\ncost is low and the gain is real: no truncated series, no free parameter, and a\nrelative accuracy better than 1% for typically 16 nodes per spatial direction\nusing the most basic numerical schemes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Apr 2013 14:32:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

Signatures of the relativistic\nbehavior have been observed recently in scanning tunneling measurements on\nindividual impurities, but the conductance measurements in this regime are\ntypically dominated by electron and hole puddles. Here we present measurements\nof quantum interference noise and magnetoresistance in graphene pn junctions.\nUnlike the conductance, the quantum interference noise can provide access to\nthe scattering at the Dirac point:it is sensitive to the motion of a single\nimpurity, it depends strongly on the fundamental symmetries that describe the\nsystem and it is determined by the phase-coherent phenomena which are not\nnecessarily obscured by the puddles. The temperature and the carrier density\ndependence of resistance fluctuations and magnetoresistance in graphene p-n\njunctions at low temperatures suggest that the noise is dominated by the\nquantum interference due to scattering on impurities and that the noise minimum\ncould be used to determine the point where the average carrier density is zero.\nAt larger carrier densities, the amplitude of the noise depends strongly on the\nsign of the impurity charge, reflecting the fact that the electrons and the\nholes are scattered by the impurity potential in an asymmetric manner.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Apr 2013 15:21:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-24"}

For marine planktonic larvae, movement due to\ncurrents is often orders of magnitude greater than movement due to swimming\nbehaviour, so transport is largely passive.\n  Current patterns are determined by the interaction of geography with tidal\nforces, modified by meteorological conditions. These linkages impose an\narea-specific focus to connectivity studies. Yet, how geographical features and\nmeteorological forcing combine to produce specific current patterns and\nresultant connectivity among populations remains unclear.\n  In this study, we followed tracks of generic particles driven by modelled\nhydrodynamic currents to investigate how connectivity between evenly spaced\nhabitat sites varies in relation to coastal topography. Larvae released from\nregions of high current velocity, open coastline and low local habitat\navailability travelled furthest but were less likely to disperse successfully.\nExtensive natal habitat in the vicinity of a site generally had a positive\nimpact on the number of larvae arriving, as did low current velocities.\nHowever, relationships between numbers of arriving larvae and local\ngeographical indices were complex, particularly at longer larval durations.\n  Local geography alone explained up to 50% of the variance in success of\nlarvae released and around 10% of the variation in the number of larvae\narriving at each site, but coastline properties fall short of predicting\ndispersal measures for particular locations. The study shows that\nmeteorological variation and broad scale current patterns interact strongly\nwith local geography to determine connectivity in coastal areas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Apr 2013 15:23:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Jul 2013 11:23:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-02"}

This structure implements\na stepped impedance low-pass filter for the propagating surface plasmons by\nadequately controlling the guiding properties of each strip section through\ngraphene's field effect. A synthesis procedure is presented to design filters\nwith desired specifications in terms of cut-off frequency, in-band performance,\nand rejection characteristics. The electromagnetic modeling of the structure is\nefficiently performed by combining an electrostatic scaling law to compute the\nguiding features of each strip section with a transmission line and\ntransfer-matrix framework, approach further validated via full wave\nsimulations. The performance of the proposed filters is evaluated in practical\nscenarios, taking into account the presence of the gating bias and the\ninfluence of graphene's losses.
