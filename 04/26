For the first time, herein, we have\nsystematically studied the effect of temperature on the thermal conductance\nbehavior of polycrystalline graphene for a range of grain sizes and grain\nboundary types, by using non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. It is\nnoted that increasing the tempera-ture remarkably enhances thermal boundary\nconductance (Kapitza conductance) across grain boundaries while it deteriorates\nthermal conductivities of defect-free grain regions, regardless of grain sizes\nand grain boundary types. This enhancement effect becomes more important for\nsmaller grain sizes and higher temperatures, whose normal adverse effects on\nthe heat transfer are thus ideally counterbalanced, making total thermal\nconductivity rather robust against the temperature increment for sufficiently\nsmall grain sizes. Upon heating from 300 to 500 K, thermal conductivity of\ngraphene with maximally tilted grain boundaries decreases only by 9 % for a\ngrain size of 50 nm in contrast to the decrease of 28 % for 250 nm, and\nfurther, it even increases below 30 nm. We presented quantitative mapping of\nits (grain, grain boundaries, and total) thermal conductivi-ties in terms with\ngrain sizes and temperatures, providing a guideline for graphene-based thermal\nengineering and suggesting novel defect-based thermal architectures as well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Apr 2013 16:00:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-26"}

Often noise is incorprated into deterministic network models using\nextrinsic noise sources. An alternative approach is to assume that noise arises\nintrinsically as a collective population effect, which has led to a master\nequation formulation of stochastic neural networks. In this paper we extend the\nmaster equation formulation by introducing a stochastic model of neural\npopulation dynamics in the form of a velocity jump Markov process. The latter\nhas the advantage of keeping track of synaptic processing as well as spiking\nactivity, and reduces to the neural master equation in a particular limit. The\npopulation synaptic variables evolve according to piecewise deterministic\ndynamics, which depends on population spiking activity. The latter is\ncharacterised by a set of discrete stochastic variables evolving according to a\njump Markov process, with transition rates that depend on the synaptic\nvariables.

Within linear response theory (weak\ntunnelling but arbitrary source-drain voltage) we find a general expression for\nthe current due to tunnelling of quasiparticles in terms of Carlson's $R$\nfunction. Our result is valid for fractional quantum Hall states with an edge\ntheory consisting of a charged channel and any number of neutral channels, with\npossibly different edge velocities and different chiralities. We analyse the\ncase with a single neutral channel in detail, which applies for instance to the\nedge of the Moore-Read state. In addition we consider an asymmetric\ninterferometer with different edge lengths between the point contacts on\nopposite edges, and we study the behaviour of the current as a function of\nvarying edge length. Recent experiments attempted to measure the Aharanov-Bohm\neffect by changing the area inside the interferometer using a plunger gate.\nTheoretical analyses of these experiments have so far not taken into account\nthe accompanying change in the edge lengths. We show that the tunnelling\ncurrent exhibits multiple osculations as a function of this edge length, with\nfrequencies proportional to the injected edge current and inversely\nproportional to the edge velocities. In particular the edge velocities can be\nmeasured by looking at the Fourier spectrum of the edge current. We provide a\nnumerical scheme to calculate and plot the $R$ function, and include sample\nplots for a variety of edge states with parameter values which are\nexperimentally relevant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Apr 2013 17:35:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-29"}

At high temperatures, random motion of\nthese vortices destroys large-scale coherence. At low temperatures, vortices\nwith opposite spin can pair together, cancelling their circulation and allowing\nquasi-long-range order to appear. This Berezenskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT)\ntransition[3,4] is essentially classical, arising for example in the\ntraditional XY model for spins, but to date experimental evidence has been\nobtained only in cold quantum systems. Measurements of superfluid sound\nspeed[5] and critical velocity[6] have been consistent with scaling\npredictions, and vortices have been observed directly in cold atom\nexperiments[7,8]. However, the presence of trapping potentials restricts\nmeasurement to vortex density, rather than number, and obscures the process of\nvortex unbinding. Further, atom and fluid experiments suffer from parasitic\nheating and difficulties in phase recording, leading to results that differ\nfrom theory in many quantitative aspects. Here, we use a nonlinear optical\nsystem to directly observe the ideal BKT transition, including vortex pair\ndynamics and the correlation properties of the wavefunction, for both repulsive\nand attractiveinteractions (the photonic equivalent of ferromagnetic and\nantiferromagnetic conditions[9]). The results confirm the thermodynamics of the\nBKT transition and expose outstanding issues in the crossovers to superfluidity\nand Bose-Einstein condensation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Apr 2013 19:13:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-26"}

This paper uses data-constrained\nNLFFF models of a solar active region that erupted on 2010 April 8 as initial\ncondition in MHD simulations. These models, constructed with the techniques of\nflux rope insertion and magnetofrictional relaxation, include a stable, an\napproximately marginally stable, and an unstable configuration. The simulations\nconfirm previous related results of magnetofrictional relaxation runs, in\nparticular that stable flux rope equilibria represent key features of the\nobserved pre-eruption coronal structure very well and that there is a limiting\nvalue of the axial flux in the rope for the existence of stable NLFFF\nequilibria. The specific limiting value is located within a tighter range, due\nto the sharper discrimination between stability and instability by the MHD\ndescription. The MHD treatment of the eruptive configuration yields very good\nagreement with a number of observed features like the strongly inclined initial\nrise path and the close temporal association between the coronal mass ejection\nand the onset of flare reconnection. Minor differences occur in the velocity of\nflare ribbon expansion and in the further evolution of the inclination; these\ncan be eliminated through refined simulations. We suggest that the slingshot\neffect of horizontally bent flux in the source region of eruptions can\ncontribute significantly to the inclination of the rise direction. Finally, we\ndemonstrate that the onset criterion formulated in terms of a threshold value\nfor the axial flux in the rope corresponds very well to the threshold of the\ntorus instability in the considered active region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Apr 2013 19:18:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 24 May 2013 11:09:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 8 Jul 2014 20:57:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-10"}

After R-symmetry breaking,\nthe mediator is integrated out and an effective RPV A-term arises at tree\nlevel; RPV couplings between quarks and squarks arise only at loop level and\nreceive additional suppression. Although this mediator must be heavy compared\nto soft masses, the model introduces no new hierarchy since viable RPV can\narise when the mediator mass is near the SUSY breaking scale.

Abundances\ndetermination for some key elements can help distinguish between these\ncompetitor candidates. We present in this paper Y abundances for a sample of\n103 red giant branch stars in NGC 6121. Within measurement errors, we find that\nthe [Y/Fe] is constant in this cluster contrary to a recent suggestion.

In this paper we show that measurements of SM\nStandard Candles can be repurposed to set entirely complementary constraints on\nnew physics. To demonstrate this, we use WW cross section measurements to set\nbounds on a set of slepton-based simplified models which fill in the gaps left\nby LEP and dedicated LHC searches. Having demonstrated the sensitivity of the\nWW measurement to light sleptons, we also find regions where sleptons can\nimprove the fit of the data compared to the NLO SM WW prediction alone.\nRemarkably, in those regions the sleptons also provide for the right\nrelic-density of Bino-like Dark Matter and provide an explanation for the\nlongstanding 3 sigma discrepancy in the measurement of (g-2)_\\mu.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Apr 2013 20:01:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 6 Jun 2014 18:47:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

In particular, the social welfare cannot be approximated by a\nbetter factor then the number of players. Therefore, the literature has mainly\nresorted to Pareto-efficiency as a way to achieve efficiency in such settings.\nWhile successful in some important scenarios, in many settings it is known that\neither exactly one incentive-compatible auction that always outputs a\nPareto-efficient solution, or that no truthful mechanism can always guarantee a\nPareto-efficient outcome.

When graphene is connected to superconducting\nelectrodes, the induced magnetism leads to a gate-voltage-dependent suppression\nof the supercurrent, modified magnetic interference patterns, and\ngate-voltage-dependent magnetic hysteresis. The magnetic signatures are\ngreatest for long superconductor graphene superconductor junctions and for\nsamples with the highest initial doping, compatible with a greater number of\nionized and thus magnetic porphyrins. Our findings suggest that long-range\nmagnetism is induced through graphene by the ionized porphyrins magnetic\nmoment. This magnetic interaction is controlled by the density of carriers in\ngraphene, a tunability that could be exploited in spintronic applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Apr 2013 08:25:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 Jan 2016 10:02:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-18"}

A predefined grid in the problem\ndomain and a stability step size restriction must be accepted. Evidence is\ngiven that efforts need for overcoming these heavy constraints. Recently, the\nauthors developed a meshless method to avoid the connective laws among the\npoints scattered in the problem domain. Despite the good spatial properties,\nthe numerical explicit integration used in the original formulation of the\nmethod provides,also in a meshless context, spatial and time discretization\nstrictly interleaved and mutually conditioned. Afterwards, in this paper the\nstability condition is firstly addressed in a general way by allowing the time\nstep increment get away from the minimum points spacing. Meanwhile, a\nformulation of the alternating direction implicit scheme for the evolution in\ntime is combined with the meshless solver. The formulation preserves the\nleapfrog marching on in time of the explicit integration scheme. The new\nmethod, not constrained by a gridding in space and unconditionally stable in\ntime, is numerical assessed by different numerical simulations.

This moment-based\napproach has the large advantage that the computational cost is independent of\nthe number of radiative sources - it can even deal with continuous regions of\nemission such as bound-free emission from gas. As it is built directly into\nRAMSES, the RT takes natural advantage of the refinement and parallelization\nstrategies already in place.

Our claim is that the structural (coherence)\nisomorphisms of these categorical models, although generally overlooked, have\ndecidedly non-trivial computational content. The theory of categorical\ncoherence is based around reversible structural operations (canonical\nisomorphisms) that allow for transformations between related, but distinct,\nmathematical structures. A number of coherence theorems are commonly used to\ntreat these transformations as though they are identity maps, from which point\nonwards they play no part in computational models. We simply wish to point out\nthat doing so overlooks some significant computational content.\n  We give a single example (taken from an uncountably infinite set of similar\nexamples, and based on structures used in models of reversible logic and\ncomputation) of a category whose structural isomorphisms manipulate modulo\nclasses of natural numbers. We demonstrate that the coherence properties that\nusually allow us to ignore these structural isomorphisms in fact correspond to\ncountably infinite families of non-trivial identities in modular arithmetic.\nFurther, proving the correctness of these equalities without recourse to the\ntheory of categorical coherence appears to be a hard task.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Apr 2013 11:12:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-29"}

Dynamical\nhadronic and partonic systems in equilibrium are studied by the PHSD\nsimulations in a finite box with periodic boundary conditions. The ratio of the\nshear viscosity to entropy density $\\eta(T)/s(T)$ from PHSD shows a minimum\n(with a value of about 0.1) close to the critical temperature $T_c$. For\n$T<T_c$, i.e. in the hadronic phase, the ratio $\\eta/s$ rises fast with\ndecreasing temperature due to a lower interaction rate of the hadronic system\nand a significantly smaller number of degrees-of-freedom. The bulk viscosity\n$\\zeta(T)$ -- evaluated in the relaxation time approach -- is found to strongly\ndepend on the effects of mean fields (or potentials) in the partonic phase.

However, population synthesis calculations are\nunable to reproduce the magnetic white dwarf (MWD) sample without binary\ninteraction or inclusion of a population of progenitor with unobservable\nsmall-scale fields. One necessary ingredient in population synthesis is the\ninitial-to-final-mass relation (IFMR) which describes the mass-loss processes\nduring the stellar evolution. When white dwarfs are members of open clusters,\ntheir evolutionary histories can be assessed through the use of cluster\nproperties. In this work, we assess the cluster membership by correlating the\nproper-motion of MWDs with the cluster proper-motion and by analyzing the\ncandidates spectroscopically with our magnetic model spectra in order to\nestimate the effective temperature and radii. We identified SDSS\nJ085523.87+164059.0 to be a proper-motion member of Praesepe. We also included\nthe data of the formerly identified cluster members NGC 6819-8, WD 0836+201 and\nestimated the mass, cooling age and the progenitor masses of the three probable\nMWD members of open clusters.

We increase the sample of MWDs with known progenitor masses\nto ten, with the rest of the data coming from the common proper motion\nbinaries. Our investigations show that, when effects of the magnetic fields are\nincluded in the diagnostics, the estimated properties of these cluster MWDs do\nnot show evidence for deviations from the IFMR. Furthermore, we estimate the\nprecision of the magnetic diagnostics which would be necessary to determine\nquantitatively whether magnetism has any effect on the mass-loss.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Apr 2013 14:05:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

We also show that\nseveral problems which are deceptively simple in the usual definitions, become\nundecidable when we allow for local probabilistic correlations, even in\ndimension one. Armed with this formalism, we extend the notion of intrinsic\nsimulation between deterministic cellular automata, to the non-deterministic\nand stochas- tic settings. Although the intrinsic simulation relation is shown\nto become undecidable in dimension two and higher, we provide explicit tools to\nprove or disprove the existence of such a simulation between any two given\nstochastic cellular automata.

First, we provide a new interpretation of\nShemer's classical Sewing Construction for neighborly polytopes in terms of\nlexicographic extensions of oriented matroids. This allows us to provide a\nsimplified proof and to generalize it to oriented matroids in two ways: the\nExtended Sewing Construction and the Gale Sewing Construction. Estimating the\nnumber of polytopes constructed with the later, we can provide new lower bounds\nfor the number of combinatorial types of neighborly polytopes that even improve\nthe current best bounds for the number of polytopes. The combination of both\nnew techniques also allows us to construct many non-realizable neighborly\noriented matroids.\n  The degree of a point configuration is the maximal codimension of its\ninterior faces. The second part of the thesis presents various results on the\ncombinatorial structure of point configurations whose degree is small compared\nto their dimension; specifically, those whose degree is smaller than [(d+1)/2],\nthe degree of neighborly polytopes. The study of this problem comes motivated\nby Ehrhart theory, where a notion equivalent to the degree - for lattice\npolytopes - has been widely studied during the last years. In addition, the\nstudy of the degree is also related to the Generalized Lower Bound Theorem for\nsimplicial polytopes, with Cayley polytopes and with Tverberg theory.

Moreover, we show combinatorial restrictions for\nconfigurations of small degree in terms of the novel concepts of weak Cayley\nconfigurations and codegree decompositions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Apr 2013 14:35:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-29"}

The system of\nequations accounts for known inter-relation between active and inactive vitamin\nD, antigen presenting cells, effector T cells, regulatory T cells and pathogen.\nBoth time dependent and steady state solutions are obtained. The time dependent\nsolution of the system of equations reveals that the immune response is rather\nstrongly regulated in presence of vitamin D.

This opens\nup the possibility to study systems whose synaptic kernel does not lead to an\nequivalent PDE formulation. We present a numerical bifurcation study of\nlocalised states and show that the proposed models support patterns of activity\nwith varying spatial extent through the mechanism of homoclinic snaking. The\nregular organisation of these patterns is due to spatial interactions at a\nspecific scale associated with the separation of excitation peaks in the chosen\nconnectivity function. The results presented form a basis for the general study\nof localised cortical activity with inputs and, more specifically, for\ninvestigating the localised spread of orientation selective activity that has\nbeen observed in the primary visual cortex with local visual input.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Apr 2013 15:40:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-29"}

MITL is a real-time extension\nof the linear time logic LTL. Originally, MITL was defined for traces of\nnon-overlapping time intervals rather than the \"super-dense\" time traces\nallowing for intervals overlapping in single points that are employed by the\nnowadays common semantics of timed automata. In this paper we extend the\nsemantics of a fragment of MITL to super-dense time traces and devise a bounded\nmodel checking encoding for the fragment.

The idea is to blow up a finite structure,\nreplacing each 'colour or atom' by infinitely many, using blurs to represent\nthe resulting term algebra, but the blurs are not enough to blur the structure\nof the finite structure in the complex algebra. A reverse of this process\nexists in the literature, it builds algebras with infinite blurs converging to\none with finite blurs. This idea due to Hirsch and Hodkinson, uses\nprobabilistic methods of Erdos to construct a sequence of graphs with infinite\nchromatic number one that is 2 colourable. This construction, which works for\nboth relation and cylindric algebras, further shows that the class of strongly\nrepresentable atom structures is not elementary. We will generalize such a\nresult for any class of algebras between diagonal free algebras and polyadic\nalgebras with and without equality, then we further discuss possibilities for\nthe infinite dimensional case.\n  Finally, we suggest a very plausible equivalence, and that is: If $n>2$, is\nfinite, and $\\A\\in \\CA_n$ is countable and atomic, then $\\Cm\\At\\A$ is\nrepresentable if and only if $\\A\\in \\Nr_n\\CA_{\\omega}$.
