Our dust\ndetections are sensitivity limited, therefore our measured activity rate is\nnecessarily a lower limit. All comets with small perihelion distances (q < 1.8\nAU) are inactive in our survey, and the active comets in our sample are\nstrongly biased to post-perihelion epochs. We introduce the quantity\nepsilon-f-rho, intended to be a thermal emission counterpart to the often\nreported A-f-rho, and find that the comets with large perihelion distances\nlikely have greater dust production rates than other comets in our survey at\n3-7 AU from the Sun, indicating a bias in the discovered Jupiter-family comet\npopulation.

In\nthis scenario, a novel transmission and relaying strategies are proposed in\nwhich multi-layer transmission is used, on the one hand, to adaptively leverage\nthe different decoding capabilities of the relays and, on the other hand, to\nenable hybrid decode-and-forward (DF) and compress-and-forward (CF) relaying.\nThe hybrid relaying strategy allows each relay to forward part of the decoded\nmessages and a compressed version of the received signal to the decoder.

Although the core molecular machinery for actin\nnetwork growth is well preserved in most cases, the geometry of the propelled\nobstacle can vary considerably. In recent years, filament orientation\ndistribution has emerged as an important observable characterizing the\nstructure and dynamical state of the growing network. Here we derive several\ncontinuum equations for the orientation distribution of filaments growing\nbehind stiff obstacles of various shapes and validate the predicted steady\nstate orientation patterns by stochastic computer simulations based on discrete\nfilaments. We use an ordinary differential equation approach to demonstrate\nthat for flat obstacles of finite size, two fundamentally different orientation\npatterns peaked at either +35/-35 or +70/0/-70 degrees exhibit mutually\nexclusive stability, in agreement with earlier results for flat obstacles of\nvery large lateral extension. We calculate and validate phase diagrams as a\nfunction of model parameters and show how this approach can be extended to\nobstacles with piecewise straight contours. For curved obstacles, we arrive at\na partial differential equation in the continuum limit, which again is in good\nagreement with the computer simulations. In all cases, we can identify the same\ntwo fundamentally different orientation patterns, but only within an\nappropriate reference frame, which is adjusted to the local orientation of the\nobstacle contour. Our results suggest that two fundamentally different network\narchitectures compete with each other in growing actin networks, irrespective\nof obstacle geometry, and clarify how simulated and electron tomography data\nhave to be analyzed for non-flat obstacle geometries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Apr 2013 17:51:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-16"}

The problem of multiple hypothesis testing and its\nrelation to microarray studies is also considered, along with several possible\nsolutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Apr 2013 19:56:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-02"}

For example, the\n\"gold standard\" for diagnosing temporomandibular disorder (TMD) is a physical\nexamination by a trained clinician. In large studies, examining all\nparticipants in this manner is infeasible. Instead, it is common to use\nquestionnaires to screen for incidence of TMD and perform the \"gold standard\"\nexamination only on participants who screen positively. Unfortunately, some\nparticipants may leave the study before receiving the \"gold standard\"\nexamination. Within the framework of survival analysis, this results in missing\nfailure indicators. Motivated by the Orofacial Pain: Prospective Evaluation and\nRisk Assessment (OPPERA) study, a large cohort study of TMD, we propose a\nmethod for parameter estimation in survival models with missing failure\nindicators. We estimate the probability of being an incident case for those\nlacking a \"gold standard\" examination using logistic regression. These\nestimated probabilities are used to generate multiple imputations of case\nstatus for each missing examination that are combined with observed data in\nappropriate regression models. The variance introduced by the procedure is\nestimated using multiple imputation. The method can be used to estimate both\nregression coefficients in Cox proportional hazard models as well as incidence\nrates using Poisson regression. We simulate data with missing failure\nindicators and show that our method performs as well as or better than\ncompeting methods. Finally, we apply the proposed method to data from the\nOPPERA study.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Apr 2013 20:14:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 29 Jul 2013 14:52:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 24 Feb 2015 09:51:30 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 7 Jul 2015 06:20:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-08"}

To deal with variable channel\nstates, a coding scheme of hierarchically utilizing polar codes is proposed. In\nparticular, by observing the polarization of different binary symmetric\nchannels over different fading blocks, each channel use corresponding to a\ndifferent polarization is modeled as a binary erasure channel such that polar\ncodes could be adopted to encode over blocks.

This is, of course, a central question in problems\ninvolving \"Big Data.\" Often a key assumption is that measurement errors in each\nvariable are independent. This precise formulation has its roots in the work of\nCharles Spearman in 1904 and of Ragnar Frisch in the 1930's. Various topics\nsuch as errors-in-variables, factor analysis, and instrumental variables, all\nrefer to alternative formulations of the problem of how to account for the\nanticipated way that noise enters in the data. In the present paper we begin by\ndescribing the basic theory and provide alternative modern proofs to some key\nresults. We then go on to consider certain generalizations of the theory as\nwell applying certain novel numerical techniques to the problem. A central role\nis played by the Frisch-Kalman dictum which aims at a noise contribution that\nallows a maximal set of simultaneous linear relations among the noise-free\nvariables --a rank minimization problem. In the years since Frisch's original\nformulation, there have been several insights including trace minimization as a\nconvenient heuristic to replace rank minimization. We discuss convex\nrelaxations and certificates guaranteeing global optimality. A complementary\npoint of view to the Frisch-Kalman dictum is introduced in which models lead to\na min-max quadratic estimation error for the error-free variables.

Thus, instead\nof being free to diffuse throughout the entire volume, as they would be in the\nliquid state, the constituent LCPs in an IGNE are mobile only over a finite\nlength-scale controlled by the density of cross-links. We address the effects\nthat such network-induced localization have on the liquid-crystalline\ncharacteristics of an IGNE, as probed via measurements made at high\ntemperatures. In contrast with the case of uncross-linked LCPs, for IGNEs these\ncharacteristics are determined not only by thermal fluctuations but also by the\nquenched disorder associated with the cross-link constraints. To study IGNEs,\nwe consider a microscopic model of dimer nematogens in which the dimers\ninteract via orientation-dependent excluded volume forces. The dimers are,\nfurthermore, randomly, permanently cross-linked via short Hookean springs, the\nstatistics of which we model by means of a Deam-Edwards type of distribution.\nWe show that at length-scales larger than the size of the nematogens this\napproach leads to a recently proposed phenomenological Landau theory of IGNEs\n[Lu et al., Phys.

A sparse vector is to be estimated from a linearly transformed\nversion embedded in Gaussian noise. Our analysis is based on the theory of\nreproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS). After a characterization of the RKHS\nassociated with the SLGM, we derive novel lower bounds on the minimum variance\nachievable by estimators with a prescribed bias function. This includes the\nimportant case of unbiased estimation. The variance bounds are obtained via an\northogonal projection of the prescribed mean function onto a subspace of the\nRKHS associated with the SLGM. Furthermore, we specialize our bounds to\ncompressed sensing measurement matrices and express them in terms of the\nrestricted isometry and coherence parameters. For the special case of the SLGM\ngiven by the sparse signal in noise model (SSNM), we derive closed-form\nexpressions of the minimum achievable variance (Barankin bound) and the\ncorresponding locally minimum variance estimator. We also analyze the effects\nof exact and approximate sparsity information and show that the minimum\nachievable variance for exact sparsity is not a limiting case of that for\napproximate sparsity.

We use\nhydrodynamic simulations to study temporal and spatial behavior of star\nformation occurring in nuclear rings of barred galaxies where radial gas\ninflows are triggered solely by a bar potential. The star formation recipes\ninclude a density threshold, an efficiency, conversion of gas to star\nparticles, and delayed momentum feedback via supernova explosions. We find that\nstar formation rate (SFR) in a nuclear ring is roughly equal to the mass inflow\nrate to the ring, while it has a weak dependence on the total gas mass in the\nring. The SFR typically exhibits a strong primary burst followed by weak\nsecondary bursts before declining to very small values. The primary burst is\nassociated with the rapid gas infall to the ring due to the bar growth, while\nthe secondary bursts are caused by re-infall of the ejected gas from the\nprimary burst. While star formation in observed rings persists episodically\nover a few Gyr, the duration of active star formation in our models lasts for\nonly about a half of the bar growth time, suggesting that the bar potential\nalone is unlikely responsible for gas supply to the rings. When the SFR is low,\nmost star formation occurs at the contact points between the ring and the dust\nlanes, leading to an azimuthal age gradient of young star clusters. When the\nSFR is large, on the other hand, star formation is randomly distributed over\nthe whole circumference of the ring, resulting in no apparent azimuthal age\ngradient. Since the ring shrinks in size with time, star clusters also exhibit\na radial age gradient, with younger clusters found closer to the ring. The\ncluster mass function is well described by a power law, with a slope depending\non the SFR. Giant gas clouds in the rings have supersonic internal velocity\ndispersions and are gravitationally bound.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Apr 2013 10:12:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

One of the most\nattracting adaptive channel estimation methods is least mean square (LMS)\nalgorithm. However, LMS-based method is often degraded by random scaling of\ninput training signal. To improve the estimation performance, in this paper we\napply the standard least mean square/fourth (LMS/F) algorithm to adaptive\nchannel estimation (ACE). Since the broadband channel is often described by\nsparse channel model, such sparsity could be exploited as prior information.\nFirst, we propose an adaptive sparse channel estimation (ASCE) method using\nzero-attracting LMS/F (ZA-LMS/F) algorithm. To exploit the sparsity\neffectively, an improved channel estimation method is also proposed, using\nreweighted zero-attracting LMS/F (RZA-LMS/F) algorithm. We explain the reason\nwhy sparse LMS/F algorithms using l_1-norm sparse constraint function can\nimprove the estimation performance by virtual of geometrical interpretation. In\naddition, for different channel sparsity, we propose a Monte Carlo method to\nselect a regularization parameter for RA-LMS/F and RZA-LMS/F to achieve\napproximate optimal estimation performance. Finally, simulation results show\nthat the proposed ASCE methods achieve better estimation performance than the\nconventional one.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Apr 2013 12:21:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-16"}
