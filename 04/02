Recent analysis of microwave\ndata of these differing cases suggests that a similar acceleration mechanism,\nforming a power-law nonthermal tail up to a few MeV or even higher, operates in\nall the cases. However, the level of this nonthermal spectrum compared to the\noriginal thermal distribution differs significantly from one case to another,\nimplying a highly different thermal-to-nonthermal energy partition in various\ncases. This further requires a specific mechanism capable of extracting the\ncharged particles from the thermal pool and supplying them to a bulk\nacceleration process to operate in flares \\textit{in addition} to the bulk\nacceleration process itself, which, in contrast, efficiently accelerates the\nseed particles, while cannot accelerate the thermal particles. Within this\n'microwave' view on the flare energy partition and particle acceleration I\npresent a few contrasting examples of acceleration regions detected with\nmicrowave data and compare them with the most popular acceleration\nmechanisms---in DC fields, in collapsing traps, and stochastic acceleration by\na turbulence spectrum - to identify the key elements needed to conform with\nobservations. In particular, I point out that the turbulence needed to drive\nthe particle acceleration is generated in nonpotential magnetic structures,\nwhich results in nonzero helicity of the turbulence. This helicity, in its\nturn, produces a nonzero mean DC electric field on top of stochastic turbulent\nfields driving the main stochastic acceleration; thus, acceleration by helical\nturbulence combines properties of the standard stochastic acceleration with\nsome features of acceleration in DC electric fields, exactly what is demanded\nby observation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Apr 2013 16:03:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-02"}

In gapped systems with time reversal symmetry, these Berry phases are\nquantized, hence able in principle to characterize different phases. In the\ncase of a fully frustrated ladder where the total spin on a rung is a conserved\nquantity that changes abruptly upon increasing the rung coupling, we show that\ntwo Berry phases are relevant to detect such phase transitions: the rung Berry\nphase defined by imposing a twist on one rung coupling, and the twist Berry\nphase defined by twisting the boundary conditions along the legs. In the case\nof non-frustrated ladders, we have followed the fate of both Berry phases when\ninterpolating between standard ladders and dimerized spin chains. A careful\ninvestigation of the spin gap and of edge states shows that a change of twist\nBerry phase is associated to a quantum phase transition at which the bulk gap\ncloses, and at which, with appropriate boundary conditions, edge states appear\nor disappear, while a change of rung Berry phase is not necessarily associated\nto a quantum phase transition. The difference is particularly acute for regular\nladders, in which the twist Berry phase does not change at all upon increasing\nthe rung coupling from zero to infinity while the rung Berry phase changes 2S\ntimes. By analogy with the fully frustrated ladder, these changes are\ninterpreted as cross-overs between domains in which the rungs are in different\nstates of total spin from 0 in the strong rung limit to 2S in the weak rung\nlimit. This interpretation is further supported by the observation that these\ncross-overs turn into real phase transitions as a function of rung coupling if\none rung is strongly ferromagnetic, or equivalently if one rung is replaced by\na spin 2S impurity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Apr 2013 16:38:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 Sep 2013 12:07:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-20"}

Chemical composition analysis of their ejecta\nshows that nova outbursts occur on both carbon-oxygen (CO) and more massive\noxygen-neon (ONe) WDs, and that there is cross-boundary mixing between the\naccreted envelope and underlying WD. We demonstrate that the state-of-the-art\nstellar evolution code MESA and post-processing nucleosynthesis tools of NuGrid\ncan successfully be used for modeling of CO and ONe nova outbursts and\nnucleosynthesis. The convective boundary mixing (CBM) in our 1D numerical\nsimulations is implemented using a diffusion coefficient that is exponentially\ndecreasing with a distance below the bottom of the convective envelope. We show\nthat this prescription produces maximum temperature evolution profiles and\nnucleosynthesis yields in good agreement with those obtained using the commonly\nadopted 1D nova model in which the CBM is mimicked by assuming that the\naccreted envelope has been pre-mixed with WD's material.

Here, we confirm this result for ONe novae. Additionally, we find\nthat the interplay between the 3He production and destruction in the\nsolar-composition envelope accreted with an intermediate rate, e.g. dM/dt =\n1e-10 M_sun/yr, by the 1.15 M_sun ONe WD with a relatively high initial central\ntemperature, e.g. T_WD = 15e6 K, leads to the formation of a thick radiative\nbuffer zone that separates the bottom of the convective envelope from the WD\nsurface.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Apr 2013 18:51:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-02"}

Current MMF standards, such as OM3 and OM4, use fibers with core\nradii of 50 \\mu m, allowing hundreds of modes to propagate. Unfortunately, due\nto physical and computational complexity limitations, we cannot couple and\ndetect hundreds of data streams into and out of the fiber. In order to\ncircumvent this issue, we present input-output coupling schemes that allow the\nuser to couple and extract a reasonable number of signals from a fiber with\nmany modes. This approach is particularly attractive as it is scalable; i.e.,\nthe fibers do not have to be replaced every time the number of transmitters or\nreceivers is increased, a phenomenon that is likely to happen in the near\nfuture.\n  We present a statistical channel model that incorporates intermodal\ndispersion, chromatic dispersion, mode dependent losses, mode coupling, and\ninput-output coupling. We show that the statistics of the fiber's frequency\nresponse are independent of frequency. This simplifies the computation of the\naverage Shannon capacity of the fiber. We also provide an input-output coupling\nstrategy that leads to an increase in the overall capacity. This strategy can\nbe used whenever channel state information (CSI) is available at the\ntransmitter. We show that the capacity of an Nt by Nt MIMO system over a fiber\nwith M>>Nt modes can approach the capacity of an Nt-mode fiber with no\nmode-dependent losses. We finally present a statistical input-output coupling\nmodel in order to quantify the loss in capacity when CSI is not available at\nthe transmitter. It turns out that the loss, relative to Nt-mode fibers, is\nminimal (less than 0.5 dB) for a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs)\nand a reasonable range of MDLs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Apr 2013 19:15:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-02"}

For low values of the characteristic convergence\n($\\kappa_s \\ll 1$) of this model - corresponding to galaxy and galaxy group\nmass scales - a high numerical precision is required in order to accurately\ncompute several quantities in the strong lensing regime. An alternative for\nfast and accurate computations is to derive analytic approximations in this\nlimit. In this work we obtain analytic solutions for several lensing quantities\nfor elliptical (ENFW) and pseudo-elliptical (PNFW) NFW lens models on the\ntypical scales where gravitational arcs are expected to be formed, in the\n$\\kappa_s \\ll 1$ limit, establishing their domain of validity.

The fraction of the CIB\nresolved by our catalog is (69 $\\pm$ 15)% at 24um, (78 $\\pm$ 17)% at 70um, (58\n$\\pm$ 13)% at 100um, (78 $\\pm$ 18)% at 160um, (80 $\\pm$ 17)% at 250um, (69\n$\\pm$ 14)% at 350um, (65 $\\pm$ 12)% at 500um, and (45 $\\pm$ 8)% at 1100um. Of\nthat total, about 95% originates from star-forming galaxies, while the\nremaining 5% is from apparently quiescent galaxies. The CIB at $\\lambda$ <\n200um is sourced predominantly from galaxies at z < 1, while at $\\lambda$ >\n200um the bulk originates from 1 < z < 2. Galaxies with stellar masses log(M/\nM_sun)=9.5-11 are responsible for the majority of the CIB, with those in the\nlog(M/ M_sun)=9.5-10 contributing mostly at $\\lambda$ < 250um, and those in the\nlog(M/ M_sun)=10.5-11 bin dominating at $\\lambda$ > 350um. The contribution\nfrom galaxies in the log(M/ M_sun)=9.0-9.5 and log(M/ M_sun)=11.0-12.0 stellar\nmass bins contribute the least, both of order 5%, although the highest\nstellar-mass bin is a significant contributor to the luminosity density at z >\n2.

The observed dense\ncores' mass function (CMF) matches well with the initial mass function (IMF) of\nstars in young clusters. Similar CMF's are observed in other star forming\nregions such as the Aquila Nebula, albeit with some dispersion. The shape of\nthese CMF provides important clues to the competing physical processes which\nlead to star formation and its feedback on the interstellar media. In this\npaper, we investigate the dynamical origin of the the mass function of starless\ncores which are confined by a warm, less dense medium.

We\nderive the values of albedo and eccentricity that match the observed transit\ndepth. We then perform N-body simulations of the planetary system including\ntides and General Relativity to follow the evolution of the eccentricity of\nplanet e. We compare the range of eccentricities given by the simulations with\nthe eccentricities required to alter the eclipse depth. We find that the\neccentricity of planet e can be large enough to contribute at a measurable\nlevel to the thermal emission measured with Spitzer. This affects the\nconstraints on the albedo of the planet, which can be as high as 0.9 (instead\nof 0.55 when ignoring tidal heating). We also derive a maximum value for the\neccentricity of planet e directly from the eclipse depth: e<0.015 assuming\nEarth's dissipation constant. Transiting exoplanets in multiple planet systems\nare exceptional targets for testing tidal models because their tidal luminosity\nmay be observable. Future multi-wavelengths observations of eclipse depth and\nphase curves (for instance with EChO and JWST) should allow us to better\nresolve the temperature map of these planets and break the degeneracy between\nalbedo and tidal heating that remains for single band observations. In\naddition, an accurate determination of the eccentricity will make it possible\nto constrain the dissipation rate of the planet and to probe its internal\nstructure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Apr 2013 20:01:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

We use two independent estimators for the\nlocal entrainment velocity $v_n$ based on the enstrophy budget. The data show\nclear evidence for the existence of a viscous superlayer (VSL) that envelopes\nthe turbulence. The VSL is a nearly one-dimensional layer with low surface\ncurvature.

This\nappears to require that multiple episodes of star formation and light element\nenrichment are the norm in the history of a globular cluster. We show that\nthere are detectable observational signatures of multiple formation events in\nthe unresolved spectra of massive, young extragalactic star clusters. We\npresent the results of a pilot program to search for one of the cleanest\nsignatures that we identify - the combined presence of emission lines from a\nvery recently formed population and absorption lines from a somewhat older\npopulation. A possible example of such a system is identified in the Antennae\ngalaxies. This source's spectrum shows evidence of two stellar populations with\nages of 8 Myr and 80 Myr. Further investigation shows that these populations\nare in fact physically separated, but only by a projected distance of 59 pc. We\nshow that the clusters are consistent with being bound and discuss the\npossibility that their coalescence could result in a single globular cluster\nhosting multiple stellar populations. While not the prototypical system\nproposed by most theories of the formation of multiple populations in clusters,\nthe detection of this system in a small sample is both encouraging and\ninteresting. Our investigation suggests that expanded surveys of massive young\nstar clusters should detect more clusters with such signatures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Apr 2013 20:49:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

Comparing the community structure to observed\nresting-state functional connectivity revealed communities across a broad range\nof dynamical scales that were closely related to functional connectivity. This\nresult suggests a mapping between communities in structural networks, models of\ncommunication processes, and brain function.

However, an insurance company,\napplying the net-premium principle, goes bankrupt with probability one in the\nlong run, even if the company covers its entire costs by collecting the\nrespective fees from its customers. It is therefore an intrinsic necessity for\nthe insurance industry to apply premium principles, which guarantee at least\nfurther existence of the company itself; otherwise, the company naturally could\nnot insure its clients to cover their potential, future claims. Beside this\nintriguing fact the underlying loss distribution typically is not known\nprecisely. Hence alternative premium principles have been developed. A simple\nprinciple, ensuring risk-adjusted credibility premiums, is the distorted\npremium principle. This principle is convenient in insurance companies, as the\nactuary does not have to change his or her tools to compute the premiums or\nreserves. This paper addresses the distorted premium principle from various\nangles. First, dual characterizations are developed. Next, distorted premiums\nare typically computed by under-weighting or ignoring low, but over-weighting\nhigh losses. It is demonstrated here that there is an alternative, opposite\npoint of view, which consists in leaving the probability measure unchanged, but\nincreasing the outcomes instead. It turns out that this new point of view is\nnatural in actuarial practice, as it can be used for premium calculations, as\nwell as to determine the reserves of subsequent years in a time consistent way.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Apr 2013 22:05:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-03"}

The\nfirst theory is the so-called Thermal Wave Model (TWM) that interprets the\nparaxial thermal spreading of the beam particles as the analog of the quantum\ndiffraction. The other theory, hereafter called Quantum Wave Model (QWM), that\ntakes into account the individual quantum nature of the single beam particle\n(uncertainty principle and spin) and provides the collective description of the\nbeam transport in the presence of the quantum paraxial diffraction. QWM can be\napplied to beams that are sufficiently cold to allow the particles to manifest\ntheir individual quantum nature but sufficiently warm to make overlapping-less\nthe single-particle wave functions. In both theories, the propagation of the\nbeam transport in plasmas or in vacuo is provided by fully similar set of\nnonlinear and nonlocal governing equations, where in the case of TWM the\nCompton wavelength (fundamental emittance) is replaced by the beam thermal\nemittance. In both models, the beam transport in the presence of the\nself-fields (space charge and inductive effects) is governed by a suitable\nnonlinear nonlocal 2D Schroedinger equation that is used to obtain the envelope\nbeam equation in quantum and quantum-like regimes, respectively. An envelope\nequation is derived for both TWM and QWM regimes. In TWM we recover the well\nknown Sacherer equation whilst, in QWM we obtain the evolution equation of the\nsingle-particle spot size, i.e., single quantum ray spot in the transverse\nplane (Compton regime). We show that such a quantum evolution equation contains\nthe same information carried out by an evolution equation for the beam spot\nsize (description of the beam as a whole). This is done by defining the lowest\nQWM state reachable by a system of overlapping-less Fermions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Apr 2013 23:10:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-20"}

Toward this end, K\\\"{o}tter and Kschischang propose the use of\nsubspace codes to provide error correction in the network coding context. The\nprimary construction for subspace codes is the lifting of rank-metric or matrix\ncodes, a process that preserves the structural and distance properties of the\nunderlying code. Thus, to characterize the structure and error-correcting\ncapability of these subspace codes, it is valuable to perform such a\ncharacterization of the underlying rank-metric and matrix codes. This paper\nlays a foundation for this analysis through a framework for classifying\nrank-metric and matrix codes based on their structure and distance properties.\n  To enable this classification, we extend work by Berger on equivalence for\nrank-metric codes to define a notion of equivalence for matrix codes, and we\ncharacterize the group structure of the collection of maps that preserve such\nequivalence. We then compare the notions of equivalence for these two related\ntypes of codes and show that matrix equivalence is strictly more general than\nrank-metric equivalence. Finally, we characterize the set of equivalence maps\nthat fix the prominent class of rank-metric codes known as Gabidulin codes. In\nparticular, we give a complete characterization of the rank-metric automorphism\ngroup of Gabidulin codes, correcting work by Berger, and give a partial\ncharacterization of the matrix-automorphism group of the expanded matrix codes\nthat arise from Gabidulin codes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Apr 2013 23:42:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-03"}

The construction of optimal rank preconditioners is strongly\nrelated to the possibility of splitting A as A = P + R + E, where E is a small\nperturbation and R is of low rank. In the present work we extend the black-dot\nalgorithm for the computation of such splitting for P circulant, to the case\nwhere P is in L, for several known low-complexity matrix algebras L.

We also make use of\nSpitzer infrared observations to characterise the star-formation activity in\nthe source. The source is filamentary and remains a double-core system on the\n3400 AU scale probed here, where the projected separation between IRAS 05399\nand SMM 1 is 0.14 pc. The broadband spectral energy distribution of IRAS 05399\nsuggests that it is near the Stage 0/I borderline. A visual inspection of the\nSpitzer/IRAC images provides hints of a quadrupolar-like jet morphology around\nIRAS 05399, supporting the possibility that it is a binary system. The\ntemperature map reveals warm spots towards IRAS 05399 and the southeastern tip\nof the source.

The dynamic of\nthe accreted torus varies with the size of initial stable torus, black hole\nspin and other variables, such as Mach number, sound speed, cusp location of\nthe torus, etc. The mass accretion rate is slightly proportional to the\ntorus-to-hole mass ratio in the black hole-torus system, but it strongly\ndepends on the cusp location of the torus. The cusp located in the\nequipotential surfaces of the effective potential moves outwards into the\ntorus.

Here we show that\nType I LGRBs (LGRBs I) exhibit different shapes of light curves from Type II\nLGRBs (LGRBs II). Furthermore, we demonstrate that this classification has\nuncovered a new scaling law in the light curves of LGRBs II spanning 8 orders\nof magnitude from the prompt to late X-ray afterglow emission. The scaled light\ncurve has four distinct phases. The first phase has a characteristic time scale\nwhile the subsequent three phases exhibit power law behaviors with different\nexponents.

By simplifying the\ndynamics, our model follows the build-up and transport of electric currents and\nfree magnetic energy in the corona, offering an insight into the magnetic\nstructure and topology that extrapolation-based models can not. To enable these\nextended simulations, we have implemented a more efficient numerical grid, and\nhave carefully calibrated the surface flux transport model to reproduce the\nobserved large-scale photospheric radial magnetic field, using emerging active\nregions determined from observed line-of-sight magnetograms. This calibration\nis described in some detail. In agreement with previous authors, we find that\nthe standard flux transport model is insufficient to simultaneously reproduce\nthe observed polar fields and butterfly diagram during Cycle 23, and that\nadditional effects must be added. For the best-fit model, we use automated\ntechniques to detect the latitude-time profile of flux ropes and their\nejections over the full solar cycle.

In order to implement the theoretical\nframework on actual hardware, several adaptations were made to compensate\nhardware delays. Although Berkeley motes have the advantage of being readily\navailable and highly flexible, they bear many delay sources which have to be\naddressed. In small networks, the protocol was found to deliver precisions up\nto three microseconds over one hop.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Apr 2013 14:31:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-03"}

It was observed previously that contracting edges that satisfy the so\ncalled link condition preserves homeomorphism in low dimensional complexes, and\nhomotopy in general. But, checking the link condition involves computation in\nall dimensions, and hence can be costly, especially in high dimensional\ncomplexes. We define a weaker and more local condition called the p-link\ncondition for each dimension p, and study its effect on edge contractions. We\nprove the following: (i) For homology groups, edges satisfying the p- and\n(p-1)-link conditions can be contracted without disturbing the p-dimensional\nhomology group. (ii) For relative homology groups, the (p-1)-, and the\n(p-2)-link conditions suffice to guarantee that the contraction does not\nintroduce any new class in any of the resulting relative homology groups,\nthough some of the existing classes can be destroyed. Unfortunately, the\nsurjection in relative homolgy groups does not guarantee that no new relative\ntorsion is created. (iii) For torsions, edges satisfying the p-link condition\nalone can be contracted without creating any new relative torsion and the\np-link condition cannot be avoided. The results on relative homology and\nrelative torsion are motivated by recent results on computing optimal\nhomologous chains, which state that such problems can be solved by linear\nprogramming if the complex has no relative torsion. Edge contractions that do\nnot introduce new relative torsions, can safely be availed in these contexts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Apr 2013 15:28:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-03"}

We explore the\nseparability structure of this spacetime and show that the Hamilton-Jacobi\nequation for geodesics admits the complete separation of variables only for\nmassless geodesics. This implies the existence of the hidden symmetries in the\nspacetime, which are generated by the conformal Killing tensor. Using a simple\ntrick built up on a conformally related metric (an \"effective\" metric) with the\nKilling tensor, we construct the explicit expression for the conformal Killing\ntensor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Apr 2013 15:35:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-03"}

The\nspatial distribution and kinematics of the ionized and molecular gas are\nremarkably similar and are well modeled by a turbulent, globally Toomre\nunstable rotating disk. The stellar surface density distribution is smoother\nthan the clumpy rest-frame UV/optical light distribution, and peaks in an\nobscured, star forming massive bulge near the dynamical center. The molecular\ngas surface density and the effective optical screen extinction track each\nother and are well modeled by a 'mixed' extinction model.

Here we investigate nonlocal correlations induced by the transfer of\npure spin currents through a superconductor on a scale comparable to the\nsuperconducting coherence length. As with charge currents, two processes\ncontribute to the nonlocal spin signal: crossed Andreev reflection (CAR), where\nan electron with spin up injected from one normal metal into the superconductor\nresults in a hole with spin down being injected into the second normal metal,\nand elastic cotunneling (EC), where the electron with spin up injected from the\nfirst normal metal results in an electron with spin up being injected into the\nsecond normal metal. Unlike charge currents, however, the spin currents\nassociated with CAR and EC add due to the fact that the bulk superconductor\ncannot sustain a net spin current.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Apr 2013 15:39:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

The morphology and the kinematics of the gas in the blue lobe are\nconsistent with models of outflow entrainment by a wide-angle wind, and a\nsimple model describes the observed structures in the position-velocity diagram\nand the velocity-integrated intensity maps. The red lobe exhibits a more\ncomplex structure, and there is evidence that this lobe is entrained by a\nwide-angle wind and a collimated episodic wind. Three major clumps along the\noutflow axis show velocity distribution consistent with prompt entrainment by\ndifferent bow shocks formed by periodic mass ejection episodes which take place\nevery few hundred years.

The energy density of the single cosmological fluid is\nlarger than the sum of the energy densities of the two perfect fluids, i.e.,\ndark energy and dark matter, respectively, and contains a correction term due\nto the anisotropy generated by the differences in the four-velocities.\nFurthermore, the gravitational field equations of the two-fluid anisotropic\ncosmological model are obtained for a Bianchi type I geometry. By assuming that\nthe non-comoving motion of the dark energy and dark matter induces small\nperturbations in the homogeneous and isotropic\nFriedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker type cosmological background, and that the\nanisotropy parameter is small, the equations of the cosmological perturbations\ndue to the non-comoving nature of the two major components are obtained. The\ntime evolution of the metric perturbations is explicitly obtained for the cases\nof the exponential and power law background cosmological expansion. Therefore,\nif there is a slight difference between the four-velocities of the dark energy\nand dark matter, the Universe would acquire some anisotropic characteristics,\nand its geometry will deviate from the standard FLRW one.

For\nlarge scales, (structures beyond ~ 100 kpc) WDM and CDM yield identical results\nwhich agree with observations. For intermediate scales, WDM gives the correct\nabundance of substructures. Inside galaxy cores, below ~ 100 pc, N-body WDM\nclassical physics simulations are incorrect because at such scales quantum WDM\neffects are important. WDM quantum calculations (Thomas-Fermi approach) provide\ngalaxy cores, galaxy masses, velocity dispersions and density profiles in\nagreement with the observations. For a dark matter particle decoupling at\nthermal equilibrium (thermal relic), all evidences point out to a 2 keV\nparticle. Remarkably enough, sterile neutrinos decouple out of thermal\nequilibrium with a primordial power spectrum similar to a 2 keV thermal relic\nwhen the sterile neutrino mass is about 7 keV. Therefore, WDM can be formed by\n7 keV sterile neutrinos. Excitingly enough, Bulbul et al. (2014) announced the\ndetection of a cluster X-ray emission line that could correspond to the decay\nof a 7.1 keV sterile neutrino and to a neutrino decay mixing angle of \\sin^2 2\n\\theta ~ 7 10^{-11} . This is a further argument in favour of sterile neutrino\nWDM. Baryons, represent 10 % of DM or less in galaxies and are expected to give\na correction to pure WDM results. The detection of the DM particle depends upon\nthe particle physics model. Sterile neutrinos with keV scale mass (the main WDM\ncandidate) can be detected in beta decay for Tritium and Renium and in the\nelectron capture in Holmiun. The sterile neutrino decay into X rays can be\ndetected observing DM dominated galaxies and through the distortion of the\nblack-body CMB spectrum.

Social science may be strengthened by the execution of more\ngood case studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Apr 2013 10:31:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-05"}
