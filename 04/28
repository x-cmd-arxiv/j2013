To\nmatch the observed mass accretion rates requires a disc-to-star mass ratio of\nat least ~0.5, which produces sub-mm fluxes that are similar to those observed\nfor L1527 IRS in the absence of irradiation from the envelope or central star.\nIf irradiation is significant, then the predicted fluxes exceed the observed\nfluxes by around an order of magnitude.

The convergent\nproperties of this error are studied as the time step $\\Delta t$ (for updating\nthe molecular-based part of the model) approaches zero.

We use the Weymann et al. W2400 equivalent width,\ndefined between the rest-frame continuum-windows 2240-2255 and 2665-2695 Ang.,\nas the measure of the UV Fe II emission. We find a significant shift of the\nW2400 distribution to higher values for quasars within LQGs, predominantly for\nthose LQGs with 1.1 <= <z_LQG> <= 1.5. There is a tentative indication that the\nshift to higher values increases with the quasar i magnitude. We find evidence\nthat within LQGs the ultrastrong emitters with W2400 >= 45 Ang. (more\nprecisely, ultrastrong-plus with W2400 >= 44 Ang.) have preferred\nnearest-neighbour separations of ~ 30-50 Mpc to the adjacent quasar of any\nW2400 strength. No such effect is seen for the ultrastrong emitters that are\nnot in LQGs. The possibilities for increasing the strength of the Fe II\nemission appear to be iron abundance, Ly-alpha fluorescence, and\nmicroturbulence, and probably all of these operate. The dense environment of\nthe LQGs may have led to an increased rate of star formation and an enhanced\nabundance of iron in the nuclei of galaxies.

Our previous work illustrated that the initial hydrogen densities of\nthe first equilibrium DSs are high, ~10^{17}/cm^3 for the case of 100 GeV\nWIMPs, with a stellar radius of ~2-3 AU. Subsequent authors have somehow missed\nthe fact that equilibrium DSs have the high densities they do. S12 have\nnumerically simulated the effect of dark matter annihilation on the contraction\nof a protostellar gas cloud en route to forming the first stars. They show\nresults at a density ~5 10^{14}/cm^3, slightly higher than the value at which\nannihilation heating prevails over cooling. However, they are apparently unable\nto reach the ~10^{17}/cm^3 density of our hydrostatic DS solutions. We are in\ncomplete agreement with their physical result that the gas keeps collapsing to\ndensities > 5 10^{14}/cm^3, as it must before equilibrium DSs can form. However\nwe are in disagreement with some of the words in their paper which imply that\nDSs never come to exist. It seems to us that S12 supports the DS scenario. They\nuse the sink particle approach to treat the gas that collapses to scales\nsmaller than their resolution limit. We argue that their sink is effectively a\nDS, or contains one. An accretion disk forms as more mass falls onto the sink,\nand the DS grows. S12 not only confirm our predictions about DS in the range\nwhere the simulations apply, but also solve a potential obstruction to DS\nformation by showing that dark matter annihilation prevents the fragmentation\nof the collapsing gas. Whereas fragmentation might perturb the dark matter away\nfrom the DS and remove its power source, instead S12 show that further sinks,\nif any, form only far enough away as to leave the DS undisturbed in the comfort\nof its dark matter surroundings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Apr 2013 02:09:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-30"}

Although hundreds of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have\nbeen conducted on many complex human traits in recent years, there has been\nonly limited success in translating these GWAS data into clinically useful risk\nprediction models. The predictive capability of GWAS data is largely\nbottlenecked by the available training sample size due to the presence of\nnumerous variants carrying only small to modest effects. Recent studies have\nshown that different human traits may share common genetic bases. Therefore, an\nattractive strategy to increase the training sample size and hence improve the\nprediction accuracy is to integrate data of genetically correlated phenotypes.\nYet the utility of genetic correlation in risk prediction has not been explored\nin the literature. In this paper, we analyzed GWAS data for bipolar and related\ndisorders (BARD) and schizophrenia (SZ) with a bivariate ridge regression\nmethod, and found that jointly predicting the two phenotypes could\nsubstantially increase prediction accuracy as measured by the AUC (area under\nthe receiver operating characteristic curve). We also found similar prediction\naccuracy improvements when we jointly analyzed GWAS data for Crohn's disease\n(CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). The empirical observations were substantiated\nthrough our comprehensive simulation studies, suggesting that a gain in\nprediction accuracy can be obtained by combining phenotypes with relatively\nhigh genetic correlations. Through both real data and simulation studies, we\ndemonstrated pleiotropy as a valuable asset that opens up a new opportunity to\nimprove genetic risk prediction in the future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Apr 2013 02:12:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Jul 2013 01:04:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 19 Aug 2013 16:09:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-20"}

Following the model in [Kleinberg and Raghavan 2005], the\nagents are represented as nodes in an infinite tree, which is generated by a\nrandom branching process. A query is issued by the root, and each node\npossesses an answer with an independent probability $p=1/n$. Further, each node\nin the tree acts strategically to maximize its own payoff. In order to\nencourage the agents to participate in the information acquisition process, an\nincentive mechanism is needed to reward agents who provide the information as\nwell as agents who help to facilitate such acquisition.\n  We focus on designing efficient sybil-proof incentive mechanisms, i.e., which\nare robust to fake identity attacks. %We consider incentive mechanisms which\nare sybil-proof, i.e., robust to fake identity attacks. We propose a family of\nmechanisms, called the direct referral (DR) mechanisms, which allocate most\nreward to the information holder as well as its direct parent (or direct\nreferral). We show that, when designed properly, the direct referral mechanism\nis sybil-proof and efficient. In particular, we show that we may achieve an\nexpected cost of $O(h^2)$ for propagating the query down $h$ levels for any\nbranching factor $b>1$. This result exponentially improves on previous work\nwhen requiring to find an answer with high probability. When the underlying\nnetwork is a deterministic chain, our mechanism is optimal under some mild\nassumptions. In addition, due to its simple reward structure, the DR mechanism\nmight have good chance to be adopted in practice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Apr 2013 06:30:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 31 Jul 2013 23:13:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-02"}

This is\nconsistent with the newly measured direct CP asymmetry of $B_s \\to \\pi^+ K^-$.\nThese decays are thus supposed to be important in testing the Standard Model\nand in probing new physics effects. However, the observation of pure\nannihilation decay $B_s \\to \\pi^+ \\pi^-$ appears to imply a large annihilation\nscenario with $\\rho_A \\sim 3$, in contrast to the case of $\\rho_A \\sim 1$ in\n$B_{u,d}$ decays in the framework of QCD factorization. This seems to indicate\nunexpectedly large flavor symmetry breaking effects between the annihilation\namplitudes of $B_s$ and $B_{u,d}$ decays. This apparent contradiction could be\nresolved by noticing that there is a priori no reason to justify the common\npractice of assuming the universality of annihilation parameters for different\nDirac structures of effective operators. We then argue that, for $B_{d,s} \\to\n\\pi^\\mp K^\\pm$ decays, the flavor symmetry breaking effects of annihilation\namplitudes have all been included in the initial state decay constants and are\nthus small.

This map is a\nbasic step in the definition of the iterated Browder-Livesay invariants which\ngive obstructions to realization of surgery obstructions by normal maps of\nclosed manifolds.\n  In the present paper we prove that $\\Gamma^3(\\sigma(f))=0$ for any\nBrowder-Livesay filtration of a manifold $X^{4k+1}$ with $\\pi_1(X)\\cong Q$.\n  We compute splitting obstruction groups for various inclusions $\\rho\\to Q$ of\nindex 2, describe natural maps in the braids of exact sequences, and make more\nprecise several results about surgery obstruction groups of the group $Q$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Apr 2013 10:17:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-30"}
