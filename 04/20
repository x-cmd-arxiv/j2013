To explain this contradiction we propose that superfast charge\ntransitions are possible between base pairs on individual DNA fragments\nresulting in the establishment of a quasi-equilibrium charge distribution\nduring the time less than that of charge solvation.

The Chandra and XMM imaging and\nspectroscopy reveal two surface brightness discontinuities at 45 and 76 kpc\nshown to be consistent with a pair of cold fronts. These features are\ninterpreted as due to sloshing of the central gas induced by an off-axis minor\nmerger with a perturber. This scenario is further supported by the presence of\na peculiar velocity of the central galaxy IC 1860 and the identification of a\npossible perturber in the optically disturbed spiral galaxy IC 1859. The\nidentification of the perturber is consistent with the comparison with\nnumerical simulations of sloshing. The GMRT observation at 325 MHz shows faint,\nextended radio emission contained within the inner cold front, as seen in some\ngalaxy clusters hosting diffuse radio mini-halos. However, unlike mini-halos,\nno particle reacceleration is needed to explain the extended radio emission,\nwhich is consistent with aged radio plasma redistributed by the sloshing. There\nis strong analogy of the X-ray and optical phenomenology of the IC 1860 group\nwith two other groups, NGC 5044 and NGC 5846, showing cold fronts. The evidence\npresented in this paper is among the strongest supporting the currently favored\nmodel of cold-front formation in relaxed objects and establishes the group\nscale as a chief environment to study this phenomenon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Apr 2013 16:57:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Apr 2013 07:01:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

We have developed a\nstrategy to infer evolutionary histories from expression profiles by analyzing\nsuites of genes of common function. In a manner conceptually similar to\nmolecular evolution models in which the evolutionary rates of DNA sequence at\nmultiple loci follow a gamma distribution, we modeled expression of the genes\nof an \\emph{a priori}-defined pathway with rates drawn from an inverse gamma\ndistribution. We then developed a fitting strategy to infer the parameters of\nthis distribution from expression measurements, and to identify gene groups\nwhose expression patterns were consistent with evolutionary constraint or rapid\nevolution in particular species. Simulations confirmed the power and accuracy\nof our inference method. As an experimental testbed for our approach, we\ngenerated and analyzed transcriptional profiles of four \\emph{Saccharomyces}\nyeasts. The results revealed pathways with signatures of constrained and\naccelerated regulatory evolution in individual yeasts and across the phylogeny,\nhighlighting the prevalence of pathway-level expression change during the\ndivergence of yeast species.

With the aid of Frances M. \"Rete\" Greeby he made two\ncatalogues: an Index Catalogue with basic data about each star, and a complete\ncatalogue of observations, with one observation per punched card. He enlisted\nWillem van den Bos of Johannesburg to add southern stars, and together they\npublished the Index Catalogue of Visual Double Stars, 1961.0.

These magnetic fields\nand their dynamics play a crucial role in understanding the coronal heating\nproblem and also in surface dynamo models. MBPs can theoretically be described\nto evolve out of a patch of a solar photospheric magnetic field with values\nbelow the equipartition field strength by the so-called convective collapse\nmodel. After the collapse, the magnetic field of MBPs reaches a higher stable\nmagnetic field level. The magnetic field strength distribution of small scale\nmagnetic fields as seen by MBPs is inferred. Furthermore, we want to test the\nmodel of convective collapse and the theoretically predicted stable value of\nabout 1300 G. We used four different data sets of high-resolution Hinode/SOT\nobservations that were recorded simultaneously with the broadband filter device\n(G-band, Ca II-H) and the spectro-polarimeter. To derive the magnetic field\nstrength distribution of these small scale features, the spectropolarimeter\n(SP) data sets were treated by the Merlin inversion code. The four data sets\ncomprise different solar surface types: active regions (a sunspot group and a\nregion with pores), as well as quiet Sun. In all four cases the obtained\nmagnetic field strength distribution of MBPs is similar and shows peaks around\n1300 G. This agrees well with the theoretical prediction of the convective\ncollapse model. The resulting magnetic field strength distribution can be\nfitted in each case by a model consisting of log-normal components. The\nimportant parameters, such as geometrical mean value and multiplicative\nstandard deviation, are similar in all data sets, only the relative weighting\nof the components is different.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Apr 2013 19:11:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

This shows inconsistency\nbetween population genetic models of sex ratio evolution and classical\nstrategic models. In this work a novel technique of change of coordinates will\nbe applied to the new model. This will reveal new aspects of the modelled\nphenomenon which cannot be shown or proven in the original formulation. The\nunderlying goal is to describe the dynamics of selection of particular genes in\nthe entire population, instead of in the same sex subpopulation, as in the\nprevious paper and earlier population genetics approaches. This allows for\nanalytical derivation of the unbiased strategic model from the model with\nrigorous non-simplified genetics. In effect, an alternative system of\nreplicator equations is derived. It contains two subsystems: the first\ndescribes changes in gene frequencies (this is an alternative unbiased\nformalization of the Fisher-Dusing argument), whereas the second describes\nchanges in the sex ratios in subpopulations of carriers of genes for each\nstrategy. An intriguing analytical result of this work is that fitness of a\ngene depends on the current sex ratio in the subpopulation of its carriers, not\non the encoded individual strategy. Thus, the argument of the gene fitness\nfunction is not constant but is determined by the trajectory of the sex ratio\namong carriers of that gene. This aspect of the modelled phenomenon cannot be\nrevealed by the static analysis. Dynamics of the sex ratio among gene carriers\nis driven by a dynamic \"tug of war\" between female carriers expressing the\nencoded strategic trait value and random partners of male carriers expressing\nthe average population strategy (a primary sex ratio). This mechanism can be\ncalled \"double level selection\". Therefore, gene interest perspective leads to\nmulti-level selection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Apr 2013 19:50:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 2 Mar 2014 23:00:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-05"}

Such\ntransformations have wide applications: they can decrease computation time,\npower consumption, and memory usage, and can, in some cases, allow\nimplementations of incomputable operations. Correctness proofs of approximate\nprogram transformations are by definition quantitative. Unfortunately, unlike\nwith standard program transformations, there is as of yet no modular way to\nprove correctness of an approximate transformation itself. Error bounds must be\nproved for each transformed program individually, and must be re-proved each\ntime a program is modified or a different set of approximations are applied. In\nthis paper, we give a semantics that enables quantitative reasoning about a\nlarge class of approximate program transformations in a local, composable way.\nOur semantics is based on a notion of distance between programs that defines\nwhat it means for an approximate transformation to be correct up to an error\nbound. The key insight is that distances between programs cannot in general be\nformulated in terms of metric spaces and real numbers. Instead, our semantics\nadmits natural notions of distance for each type construct; for example,\nnumbers are used as distances for numerical data, functions are used as\ndistances for functional data, an polymorphic lambda-terms are used as\ndistances for polymorphic data. We then show how our semantics applies to two\nexample approximations: replacing reals with floating-point numbers, and loop\nperforation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Apr 2013 20:06:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-23"}

We detected gamma-rays\nboth during the impulsive and temporally-extended emission phases, with\nemission above 100 MeV lasting for approximately 20 hours. Accurate\nlocalization of the gamma-ray production site(s) coincide with the solar active\nregion from which X-ray emissions associated with these flares originated. Our\nanalysis of the >100 MeV gamma-ray emission shows a relatively rapid monotonic\ndecrease in flux during the first hour of the impulsive phase, and a much\nslower, almost monotonic decrease in flux for the next 20 hours. The spectra\ncan be adequately described by a power law with a high energy exponential\ncutoff, or as resulting from the decay of neutral pions produced by accelerated\nprotons and ions with an isotropic power-law energy distribution. The required\nproton spectrum has a number index ~3, with minor variations during the\nimpulsive phase, while during the temporally extended phase the spectrum\nsoftens monotonically, starting with index ~4. The >30 MeV proton flux and\nspectra observed near the Earth by the GOES satellites also show a monotonic\nflux decrease and spectral softening during the extended phase, but with a\nharder spectrum, with index ~3. Based on the Fermi-LAT and GOES observations of\nthe flux and spectral evolution of these bright flares, we explore the relative\nmerits of prompt and continuous acceleration scenarios, hadronic and leptonic\nemission processes, and acceleration at the solar corona by the fast Coronal\nMass Ejections (CME) as explanations for the observations. We conclude that the\nmost likely scenario is continuous acceleration of protons in the solar corona\nwhich penetrate the lower solar atmosphere and produce pions that decay into\ngamma-rays.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Apr 2013 22:41:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-22"}

The challenge is to\nquantitatively determine the range of temperatures and species abundances\nallowed by the data. This challenge is often difficult given the low\ninformation content of most exoplanet spectra which commonly leads to\ndegeneracies in the interpretation. A variety of temperature and abundance\nretrieval approaches have been applied to exoplanet spectra, but no previous\ninvestigations have sought to compare these approaches. In this investigation\nwe compare three different retrieval methods: Optimal Estimation, Differential\nEvolution Markov Chain Monte Carlo, and Bootstrap Monte Carlo.

It may also be useful\nfor separating the underlying geometry of a space, say a manifold, from the\ndensity function defined on it.\n  Our approach is based on reformulating the problem of estimating\n$\\frac{q}{p}$ as an inverse problem in terms of an integral operator\ncorresponding to a kernel, and thus reducing it to an integral equation, known\nas the Fredholm problem of the first kind. This formulation, combined with the\ntechniques of regularization and kernel methods, leads to a principled\nkernel-based framework for constructing algorithms and for analyzing them\ntheoretically.\n  The resulting family of algorithms (FIRE, for Fredholm Inverse Regularized\nEstimator) is flexible, simple and easy to implement.\n  We provide detailed theoretical analysis including concentration bounds and\nconvergence rates for the Gaussian kernel in the case of densities defined on\n$\\R^d$, compact domains in $\\R^d$ and smooth $d$-dimensional sub-manifolds of\nthe Euclidean space.\n  We also show experimental results including applications to classification\nand semi-supervised learning within the covariate shift framework and\ndemonstrate some encouraging experimental comparisons. We also show how the\nparameters of our algorithms can be chosen in a completely unsupervised manner.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Apr 2013 00:57:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 Apr 2013 11:46:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-26"}

With this Hamiltonian, we use the reduced hierarchy equations of\nmotion in the Wigner space representation to study non-Markovian and\nnon-perturbative thermal effects at finite temperature in a rigorous manner. We\nstudy current variation in time and the current-voltage (I-V) relation of the\nresonant tunneling diode for several widths of the contact region, which\nconsists of doped GaAs. Hysteresis and both single and double plateau-like\nbehavior are observed in the negative differential resistance (NDR) region.\nWhile all of the current oscillations decay in time in the NDR region in the\ncase of a strong system-bath coupling, there exist self-excited high-frequency\ncurrent oscillations in some parts of the plateau in the NDR region in the case\nof weak coupling. We find that the effective potential in the oscillating case\npossesses a basin-like form on the emitter side (emitter basin) and that the\ncurrent oscillation results from tunneling between the emitter basin and the\nquantum well in the barriers. We find two distinct types of current\noscillations, with large and small oscillation amplitudes, respectively.

Flash memories\ncould soon reach their miniaturization limits mostly because reliably keeping\nenough electrons in an always smaller cell size will become increasingly\ndifficult . The control of electrical resistance at the nanometer scale\ntherefore requires new concepts, and the ultimate resistance-change device is\nbelieved to exploit a purely electronic phase change such as the Mott insulator\nto insulator transition [2].

This approach is\nmotivated by discrepancies between probability theory and game theory when\napplied to the same strategic situation. In particular, probability theory and\ngame theory can disagree on calculated values of the Fisher information, the\nlog likelihood function, entropy gradients, the rank and Jacobian of variable\ntransforms, and even the dimensionality and volume of the underlying\nprobability parameter spaces. These differences arise as probability theory\nemploys structure preserving isomorphic mappings when constructing strategy\nspaces to analyze games. In contrast, game theory uses weaker mappings which\nchange some of the properties of the underlying probability distributions\nwithin the mixed strategy space. Here, we explore how using strong isomorphic\nmappings to define game strategy spaces can alter rational outcomes in simple\ngames . Specific example games considered are the chain store paradox, the\ntrust game, the ultimatum game, the public goods game, the centipede game, and\nthe iterated prisoner's dilemma.

The neutrinos\ndecouple already about 1 second after the Big Bang at a temperature of around 1\nMeV or 10^{10} Kelvin. Today their temperature is about 1.95 Kelvin.\nRegistration of these neutrinos is an extremely challenging experimental\nproblem, which can hardly be solved with the present technologies. On the other\nhand it represents a tempting opportunity to check one of key elements of the\nBig Bang Cosmology and to probe the early stages of the universe evolution. The\nsearch for the Cosmic Neutrino Background with the induced beta decay: relic\nneutrino + 3H --> 3He + e-, is the topic of this contribution. The signal would\nshow up as a peak in the electron spectrum by an energy with the neutrino mass\nabove the Q value. We discuss the prospects of this approach and argue that it\nis able to set limits on the Cosmic Neutrino density in our vicinity. We also\ndiscuss critically ways to increase with modifications of the present KATRIN\nspectrometer the Tritium source intensity by a factor 100, which would yield\nabout 170 counts of relic neutrino captures per year. Presently such an\nincrease of the Tritium source intensity seems not to be possible. But one\nshould be able to find an upper limit for the local density of the relic\nneutrinos in our galaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Apr 2013 14:14:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 26 Apr 2013 14:43:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 4 May 2013 12:41:33 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 11 Dec 2013 23:58:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-13"}

In order to address the limitations in the efficacy of\nthe wild-type ChR2 (ChRwt) to achieve this objective, new variants of ChR2 that\nexhibit fast mono-exponential photocurrent decay characteristics have been\nrecently developed and validated. In this paper, we investigate whether the\nframework of transition rate model with 4 states, primarily developed to mimic\nthe bi-exponential photocurrent decay kinetics of ChRwt, as opposed to the low\ncomplexity 3 state model, is warranted to mimic the mono-exponential\nphotocurrent decay kinetics of the newly developed fast ChR2 variants: ChETA\n(Gunaydin et al., Nature Neurosci, 13:387-392, 2010) and ChRET/TC (Berndt et\nal., PNAS, 108:7595-7600, 2011). We begin by estimating the parameters for the\n3-state and 4-state models from experimental data on the photocurrent kinetics\nof ChRwt, ChETA and ChRET/TC. We then incorporate these models into a\nfast-spiking interneuron model (Wang and Buzsaki., J Neurosci,\n16:6402-6413,1996) and a hippocampal pyramidal cell model (Golomb et al., J\nNeurophysiol, 96:1912-1926, 2006) and investigate the extent to which the\nexperimentally observed neural response to various optostimulation protocols\ncan be captured by these models. We demonstrate that for all ChR2 variants\ninvestigated, the 4 state model implementation is better able to capture neural\nresponse consistent with experiments across wide range of optostimulation\nprotocol. We conclude by analytically investigating the conditions under which\nthe characteristic specific to the 3-state model, namely the mono-exponential\nphotocurrent decay of the newly developed variants of ChR2, can occurs in the\nframework of the 4-state model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Apr 2013 14:53:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-23"}

All the low\nenergy constants - apart from f_pi and m_rho - are fixed by the master formula\nderived from the relation between 5-D hQCD and 4-D HLS. This allows one to pin\ndown the density n_1/2 at which the skyrmions in medium fractionize into\nhalf-skyrmions, bringing in a drastic change in the EoS of dense matter. We\nfind that the U(1) field that figures in the CS term in the hQCD action or\nequivalently the omega field in the hWZ term in the dimensionally reduced HLS\naction plays a crucial role in the half-skyrmion phase. The importance of the\nomega degree of freedom may be connected to what happens in the instanton\nstructure of elementary baryon noticed in hQCD. The most striking and\nintriguing in what is found in the model is that f_pi that smoothly drops with\nincreasing density in the skyrmion phase stops decreasing at n_1/2 and remains\nnearly constant in the half-skyrmion phase. In accordance with the large N_c\nconsideration, the baryon mass also stays non-scaling in the half-skyrmion\nphase. This feature which is reminiscent of the parity-doublet baryon model\nwith a chirally invariant mass m_0 is supported by the nuclear EFT with the\nparameters of the Lagrangian scaling modified at the skyrmion-half-skyrmion\nphase transition. It also matches with one-loop RG analysis based on HLS. A\nlink between a non-vanishing m_0 and the origin of nucleon mass distinctive\nfrom dynamically generated mass is suggested.
