Boundaries where\nfully-ionized H II regions transition to neutral/molecular photodissociation\nregions (PDRs) are of particular interest because marked temperature and\ndensity contrasts across the boundaries lead to evaporative flows and fluid\ndynamical instabilities that can evolve into spectacular pillar-like\nstructures. When detached from their parent clouds, pillars become ionized\nglobules that often harbor one or more young stars. H2 molecules at the\ninterface between a PDR and an H II region absorb ultraviolet light from\nmassive stars, and the resulting fluoresced infrared emission lines are an\nideal way to trace this boundary independent of obscuring dust. This paper\npresents H2 images of four regions of massive star formation that illustrate\ndifferent types of PDR boundaries. The Ara OB1 star formation region contains a\nstriking long wall that has several wavy structures which are present in H2,\nbut the emission is not particularly bright because the ambient UV fluxes are\nrelatively low. In contrast, the Carina star formation region shows strong H2\nfluorescence both along curved walls and at the edges of spectacular pillars\nthat in some cases have become detached from their parent clouds. The\nless-spectacular but more well-known Eagle Nebula has two regions that have\nstrong fluorescence in addition to its pillars.

An empirical modeling approach (2-SFM) which\ndistinguishes between the main sequence and rarer starburst galaxies is capable\nof reproducing most statistical properties of infrared galaxies. In this paper,\nwe extend this approach by establishing a connection between stellar mass and\nhalo mass with the technique of abundance matching. Based on a few, simple\nassumptions and a physically motivated formalism, our model successfully\npredicts the (cross-)power spectra of the cosmic infrared background (CIB), the\ncross-correlation between CIB and cosmic microwave background (CMB) lensing,\nand the correlation functions of bright, resolved infrared galaxies measured by\nHerschel, Planck, ACT and SPT. We use this model to infer the redshift\ndistribution these observables, as well as the level of correlation between\nCIB-anisotropies at different wavelengths. We also predict that more than 90%\nof cosmic star formation activity occurs in halos with masses between 10^11.5\nand 10^13.5 Msun. Taking into account subsequent mass growth of halos, this\nimplies that the majority of stars were initially (at z>3) formed in the\nprogenitors of clusters, then in groups at 0.5<z<3 and finally in\nMilky-Way-like halos at z<0.5. At all redshifts, the dominant contribution to\nthe star formation rate density stems from halos of mass ~10^12 Msun, in which\nthe instantaneous star formation efficiency is maximal (~70%). The strong\nredshift-evolution of SFR in the galaxies that dominate the CIB is thus\nplausibly driven by increased accretion from the cosmic web onto halos of this\ncharacteristic mass scale.

As an application, we consider the BMN quantum mechanics that\nresults from a supersymmetric deformation of the p=0 theory. The black holes\ndual to this deformed theory have not yet been constructed, and our analysis\ncan be used to make an explicit prediction for their thermodynamic behaviour.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Apr 2013 19:43:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Jul 2013 12:56:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-23"}

This project is motivated by the need to\nunderstand the controlling dynamics at interfaces between gases of widely\ndiffering densities and temperature, i.e. multiphase media. While more\nexpensive than hydrodynamics, the kinetic approach does not suffer from\ndiscontinuities and it applies when the continuum limit does not, such as in\nthe collapse of galaxy clusters and at the interface between coronal halo gas\nand a thin neutral gas layer. Finally, the momentum flux is carried,\nself-consistently, by particles and this approach explicitly resolves and\nthereby captures shocks. The DSMC method splits the solution into two pieces:\n1) the evolution of the phase-space flow without collisions; and 2) the\nevolution governed the collision term alone without phase-space flow. This\nsplitting approach makes DSMC an ideal match to existing particle-based n-body\ncodes. If the mean free path becomes very small compared to any scale of\ninterest, the method abandons simulated particle collisions and simply adopts\nthe relaxed solution in each interaction cell consistent with the overall\nenergy and momentum fluxes.

The advantage of this gas kinetic approach over traditional\nhydrodynamics is explicit treatment of the interface between the hot and cold,\ndense and rarefied media typical of astrophysical flows and the explicit\nconservation of energy and momentum and the interface. This approach yields\nsome new physical insight. Owing to the shock and backward wave that forms at\nthe point ICM--ISM contact, ICM gas is compressed, heated and slowed. The shock\nmorphology is Mach-disk-like. In the outer galaxy, the hot turbulent post-shock\ngas flows around the galaxy disk, while heating and ablating the initially cool\ndisk gas. The outer gas and angular momentum are lost to the flow. In the inner\ngalaxy, the hot gas pressurizes the neutral ISM gas causing a strong two-phase\ninstability. As a result, the momentum of the wind is no longer impulsively\ncommunicated to the cold gas as assumed in the Gunn-Gott (1972) formula, but\noozes through the porous disk, transferring its linear momentum to the disk en\nmasse. The escaping gas mixture has a net positive angular momentum and forms a\nslowly rotating sheath.

The coarser is the\ngraining of the climatic fields, the lower is the resulting estimate of the\nmaterial entropy production. In other terms, all the spatial and temporal\nscales of variability of the thermodynamic fields provide a positive\ncontribution to the material entropy production. At all scales, the temperature\nfields and the heating fields resulting from the convergence of turbulent\nfluxes have a negative correlation, while the opposite holds between the\ntemperature fields and the radiative heating fields. Moreover, the latter\ncorrelations are stronger, which confirms that radiation acts as primary driver\nfor the climatic processes, while the material fluxes dampen the resulting\nfluctuations through dissipative processes. Using specific coarse-graining\nprocedures, one can separate the various contributions to the material entropy\nproduction coming from the dissipation of kinetic energy, the vertical sensible\nand latent heat fluxes, and the large scale horizontal fluxes. Most of the\nentropy production is associated to irreversible exchanges occurring along the\nvertical direction, and neglecting the horizontal and time variability of the\nfields has a small impact on the estimate of the material entropy production.\nThe approach presented here seems promising for testing climate models, for\nassessing the impact of changing their parametrizations and their resolution,\nand for investigating the atmosphere of exoplanets.

Typically, such mathematical models involve networks of coupled jump\nstochastic processes with a large number of parameters that need to be suitably\ncalibrated against experimental data. In this direction, the parameter\nsensitivity analysis of reaction networks is an essential mathematical and\ncomputational tool, yielding information regarding the robustness and the\nidentifiability of model parameters. However, existing sensitivity analysis\napproaches such as variants of the finite difference method can have an\noverwhelming computational cost in models with a high-dimensional parameter\nspace. We develop a sensitivity analysis methodology suitable for complex\nstochastic reaction networks with a large number of parameters. The proposed\napproach is based on Information Theory methods and relies on the\nquantification of information loss due to parameter perturbations between\ntime-series distributions. For this reason, we need to work on path-space,\ni.e., the set consisting of all stochastic trajectories, hence the proposed\napproach is referred to as \"pathwise\". The pathwise sensitivity analysis method\nis realized by employing the rigorously-derived Relative Entropy Rate (RER),\nwhich is directly computable from the propensity functions. A key aspect of the\nmethod is that an associated pathwise Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) is\ndefined, which in turn constitutes a gradient-free approach to quantifying\nparameter sensitivities. The structure of the FIM turns out to be\nblock-diagonal, revealing hidden parameter dependencies and sensitivities in\nreaction networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Apr 2013 00:59:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 Aug 2013 11:17:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-02"}

In Grid environment, scheduling is deciding about assignment of tasks\nto available resources. Scheduling in Grid is challenging when the tasks have\ndependencies and resources are heterogeneous. The main objective in scheduling\nof dependent tasks is minimizing make-span. Due to NP-complete nature of\nscheduling problem, exact solutions cannot generate schedule efficiently.\nTherefore, researchers apply heuristic or random search techniques to get\noptimal or near to optimal solution of such problems. In this paper, we show\nhow Genetic Algorithm can be used to solve dependent task scheduling problem.\nWe describe how initial population can be generated using random assignment and\nheight based approaches.

Image processing in general and hence automated\nfeature extraction, is highly computation intensive, where performance\nimprovements have a direct impact on societal needs. In this context, an\nalgorithm has been formulated for automated feature extraction from a\npanchromatic or multispectral image based on image processing techniques. Two\nLaplacian of Guassian (LoG) masks were applied on the image individually\nfollowed by detection of zero crossing points and extracting the pixels based\non their standard deviation with the surrounding pixels. The two extracted\nimages with different LoG masks were combined together which resulted in an\nimage with the extracted features and edges. Finally the user is at liberty to\napply the image smoothing step depending on the noise content in the extracted\nimage. The image is passed through a hybrid median filter to remove the salt\nand pepper noise from the image. This paper discusses the aforesaid algorithm\nfor automated feature extraction, necessity of deployment of GPUs for the same;\nsystem-level challenges and quantifies the benefits of integrating GPUs in such\nenvironment. The results demonstrate that substantial enhancement in\nperformance margin can be achieved with the best utilization of GPU resources\nand an efficient parallelization strategy. Performance results in comparison\nwith the conventional computing scenario have provided a speedup of 20x, on\nrealization of this parallelizing strategy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Apr 2013 06:03:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-16"}

Targeting the combined signal from individual lines in molecular\nbands, these measurements use variations in the planet radial velocity to\ndisentangle the planet signal from telluric and stellar contaminants. In this\npaper we apply high resolution spectroscopy to probe molecular absorption in\nthe day-side spectrum of the bright transiting hot Jupiter HD 189733b. We\nobserved HD 189733b with the CRIRES high-resolution near-infrared spectograph\non the Very Large Telescope during three nights. We detect a 5-sigma absorption\nsignal from CO at a contrast level of ~4.5e-4 with respect to the stellar\ncontinuum, revealing the planet orbital radial velocity at 154+4/-3 km s-1.\nThis allows us to solve for the planet and stellar mass in a similar way as for\nstellar eclipsing binaries, resulting in Ms= 0.846+0.068/-0.049 Msun and Mp=\n1.162+0.058/-0.039 MJup. No significant absorption is detected from H2O, CO2 or\nCH4 and we determined upper limits on their line contrasts here. The detection\nof CO in the day-side spectrum of HD 189733b can be made consistent with the\nhaze layer proposed to explain the optical to near-infrared transmission\nspectrum if the layer is optically thin at the normal incidence angles probed\nby our observations, or if the CO abundance is high enough for the CO\nabsorption to originate from above the haze. Our non-detection of CO2 at 2.0\nmicron is not inconsistent with the deep CO2 absorption from low resolution\nNICMOS secondary eclipse data in the same wavelength range. If genuine, the\nabsorption would be so strong that it blanks out any planet light completely in\nthis wavelength range, leaving no high-resolution signal to be measured.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Apr 2013 08:05:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

The spectral characteristics are derived\nthrough the fitting of five intensity samples, separated from each other by\n0.35 A, by a 4th-order polynomial. The bright network element displays the most\npronounced variations of the Dopplershift varying from 0 to 4 km/s about the\naverage of 1.5 km/s. This fact implies a persistent redshift of the Halpha core\nwith a redward asymmetry of about 0.5 km/s, suggesting an inverse-C bisector.\nThe variations of the core intensity up to +-10% and the core width up to +-5%\nabout the respective averages are much less pronounced, but still detectable.\nThe core intensity variations lag behind the Dopplershift variations about 2.1\nmin. The Halpha core width tends to correlate with the Dopplershift and\nanticorrelate with the asymmetry, suggesting that more redshifted Halpha\nprofiles are wider and the broadening of the Halpha core is accompanied with a\nchange of the core asymmetry from redward to blueward. We also found a striking\nanticorrelation between the core asymmetry and the Dopplershift, suggesting a\nchange of the core asymmetry from redward to blueward with an increasing\nredshift of the Halpha core. The data and the applied analysis do not show\nmeaningful tracks of Alfven waves in the selected network element.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Apr 2013 09:27:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-27"}

Methods: We combine a\ngas-grain chemical model with radiative transfer calculations to simulate\ndensity and temperature structure in starless cores. The chemical model\nincludes deuterated forms of species with up to 4 atoms and the spin states of\nthe light species H2, H2+ and H3+ and their deuterated forms. Results: We find\nthat HD eventually depletes from the gas phase because deuterium is efficiently\nincorporated to grain-surface HDO, resulting in inefficient HD production on\ngrains. HD depletion has consequences not only on the abundances of e.g. H2D+\nand D2H+, whose production depends on the abundance of HD, but also on the spin\nstate abundance ratios of the various light species, when compared with the\ncomplete depletion model where heavy elements do not influence the chemistry.\nConclusions: While the eventual HD depletion leads to the disappearance of\nlight deuterium-bearing species from the gas phase in a relatively short\ntimescale at high density, we find that at late stages of core evolution the\nabundances of H2D+ and D2H+ increase toward the core edge and the disributions\nbecome extended. The HD depletion timescale increases if less oxygen is\ninitially present in the gas phase, owing to chemical interaction between the\ngas and the dust predecing the starless core phase. Our results are greatly\naffected if H2 is allowed to tunnel on grain surfaces, and therefore more\nexperimental data not only on tunneling but also on the O + H2 surface reaction\nin particular is needed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Apr 2013 09:32:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

QKD is the first technology offering\ninformation theoretic secret-key distribution that relies only on the\nfundamental principles of quantum physics. Point-to-point QKD devices have\nreached a mature industrial state; however, these devices are severely limited\nin distance, since signals at the quantum level (e.g. single photons) are\nhighly affected by the losses in the communication channel and intermediate\ndevices. To overcome this limitation, intermediate nodes (i.e. repeaters) are\nused. Both, quantum-regime and trusted, classical, repeaters have been proposed\nin the QKD literature, but only the latter can be implemented in practice. As a\nnovelty, we propose here a new QKD network model based on the use of not fully\ntrusted intermediate nodes, referred as weakly trusted repeaters. This approach\nforces the attacker to simultaneously break several paths to get access to the\nexchanged key, thus improving significantly the security of the network. We\nformalize the model using network codes and provide real scenarios that allow\nusers to exchange secure keys over metropolitan optical networks using only\npassive components. Moreover, the theoretical framework allows to extend these\nscenarios not only to accommodate more complex trust constraints, but also to\nconsider robustness and resiliency constraints on the network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Apr 2013 10:52:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-16"}

At the same time, the Bose-Hubbard\nmodel with attractive interactions (ABH) is theoretically known to have a phase\ntransition from the superfluid phase to a highly entangled nonlocal\nsuperposition, but observation of this phase transition has remained out of\nexperimental reach. In this theoretical work, we jointly address these two\nproblems by (1) proposing an experimentally accessible quantum simulation of\nthe ABH phase transition in an array of tunably coupled superconducting circuit\nmicrowave resonators and (2) incorporating the simulation into a highly\nscalable protocol that takes as input any microwave resonator state with\nnegligible occupation of number states |0> and |1> and nonlocally superposes it\nacross the whole array of resonators. The large-scale multipartite entanglement\nproduced by the protocol is of the W-type, which is well-known for its\nrobustness. The protocol utilizes the ABH phase transition to generate the\nmultipartite entanglement of all of the resonators in parallel, and is\ntherefore deterministic and permits an increase in resonator number without\nincrease in protocol complexity; the number of resonators is limited instead by\nsystem characteristics such as resonator frequency disorder and inter-resonator\ncoupling strength. Only one local and two global controls are required for the\nprotocol. We numerically demonstrate the protocol with realistic system\nparameters, and estimate that current experimental capabilities can realize the\nprotocol with high fidelity for greater than 40 resonators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Apr 2013 12:10:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 28 Apr 2013 02:16:48 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 3 Jul 2013 03:41:07 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 3 Sep 2013 05:01:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-04"}

In particular, different degrees of\nthermalisation of the ordered rotational field of the galaxy are considered. We\nfind that T_* and T_gm can vary only mildly due to a pure change of shape.\nGalaxy rotation instead, when not thermalised, can lead to a large decrease of\nT_*; this effect can be larger in flatter galaxies that can be more\nrotationally supported. Recent temperature measurements T_x, obtained with\nChandra, are larger than, but close to, the T_* values of the models, and show\na possible trend for a lower T_x in flatter and more rotationally supported\ngalaxies; this trend can be explained by the lack of thermalisation of the\nwhole stellar kinetic energy.

An explanation can be\nfound in the underlying fermionic nature of excitons which rules their\ncondensation. Precisely, it was recently predicted that, at accessible\nexperimental conditions, the exciton condensate shall be \"gray\" with a dominant\ndark part coherently coupled to a weak bright component through fermion\nexchanges. This counter-intuitive quantum condensation, since excitons are\nmostly known for their optical activity, directly follows from the excitons\ninternal structure which has an optically inactive, i.e., dark, ground state.\nHere, we report compelling evidence for such a \"gray\" condensate. We use an\nall-optical approach in order to produce microscopic traps which confine a\ndense exciton gas that yet exhibits an anomalously weak photo-emission at\nsub-Kelvin temperatures.

Let G_c\ndenote the number of points per wavelength at the coarse level. If the coarse\nscale solutions are to approximate the true solutions, then the oscillatory\nnature of the solutions implies the requirement G_c > 2. However, in examples\nthe requirement is more like G_c >= 10, in a trade-off involving also the\namount of damping present and the number of multigrid iterations. We conjecture\nthat this is caused by the difference in phase speeds between the coarse and\nfine scale operators. Standard 5-point finite differences in 2-D are our first\nexample. A new coarse scale 9-point operator is constructed to match the fine\nscale phase speeds. We then compare phase speeds and multigrid performance of\nstandard schemes with a scheme using the new operator. The required G_c is\nreduced from about 10 to about 3.5, with less damping present so that waves\npropagate over > 100 wavelengths in the new scheme.

In 3-D comparable results are obtained\nwith standard 7-point differences and optimized 27-point coarse grid operators,\nleading to an order of magnitude reduction in the number of unknowns for the\ncoarsest scale linear system.

Normally, the superconducting transition\ntemperature Tc should be strongly suppressed at the S-F interface owing to the\npenetration of Cooper pairs into the ferromagnetic side. Nevertheless,\nconstructive interactions between S and F orders have been suggested to occur\nvia the modification of ferromagnetic order by the superconducting state. This\nmay induce an inhomogeneous magnetic state, often called a cryptoferromagnetic\nstate, and the relevant domain wall effect, which will lead to a local decrease\nof the pair-breaking parameter. However, the domain wall effect, even if it\nexists, is quite subtle from the experimental view point and is normally\ndifficult to observe.

One has a system of interest in equilibrium with the\nenvironment, and measures one of its quantities, for example its specific heat,\nby raising the temperature of the environment. However, within the observation\ntime the global system settles down to a state of apparent equilibrium, so that\nthe measured value of the specific heat is different from the equilibrium one.\nIn such cases formulae for quantities such as the effective specific heat\nexist, which are provided by Fluctuation Dissipation theory. However, what is\nlacking is a proof that internal energy exists, i.e., that the fundamental\ndifferential form delta Q-delta W (difference between the heat absorbed by the\nsystem and the work performed by it) is closed.

A\npromising exoplanet candidate was detected around the K2-type star HD\\,8049 in\nJuly 2010.Its contrast of $\\Delta H$=7.05 at 1.57 arcsec allowed us to guess\nthe presence of a 35 \\MJup companion at 50 projected AU, for the nominal system\nage and heliocentric distance.To check whether it was gravitationally bound to\nthe host star, as opposed to an unrelated background object, we re-observed the\nsystem one year later and concluded a high probability of a bound system. We\nalso used radial velocity measurements of the host star, spanning a time range\nof $\\sim$ 30 yr, to constrain the companion's mass and orbital properties, as\nwell as to probe the host star's spectral age indicators and general spectral\nenergy distribution. We also obtained for the companion $U$-band imaging with\nEFOSC and $NIR$ spectroscopy. Combining all these information we conclude that\nthe companion of HD\\,8049 is a white dwarf (WD), with temperature\n$T_{eff}=18800 \\pm 2100$ K and mass $M_{WD}=0.56 \\pm 0.08 M_{\\odot}$. The\nsignificant radial velocity trend coupled with the imaging data indicate that\nthe most probable orbit has a semimajor axis of about 50 AU.The discrepancy\nbetween the age indicators suggested against a bona-fide young star.

Thereby,\nthe wavefunction is followed in space and time for times longer than the pulse\nduration. Results are explicitly shown for 3 and 10 fs pulses. Particular\nattention is paid to identifying the effect of dynamic interference of\nphotoelectrons emitted with the same kinetic energy at different times during\nthe rising and falling sides of the pulse predicted in [\\emph{Ph.V.

In order to\nbe able to see the dynamic interference pattern in the computed electron\nspectra, the photoelectron wave packet has to be propagated over long\ndistances. Clearly, complex absorption potentials often employed to compute\nspectra of emitted particles cannot be used to detect dynamic interference. For\nthe considered high-frequency pulses of 3 and 10 fs durations, this requires\nenormously large spatial grids. The presently computed photoionization and\nabove-threshold ionization spectra are found to exhibit pronounced dynamic\ninterference patterns. Where available, the patterns are in very good agreement\nwith previously published results on the photoionization spectra which have\nbeen computed using a completely different method, thus supporting the\npreviously made assumption that the above-threshold ionization processes are\nvery weak for the considered pulse intensities and high carrier frequency.

Eliminating high-energy degrees of freedom at high magnetic fields, we\nconstruct low-energy effective Hamiltonians which are much simpler than the\ninitial ones. These effective Hamiltonians allow a more extended analytical and\nnumerical analysis. In addition to the standard strong-coupling perturbation\ntheory we also use a localized-magnon based approach leading to a substantial\nimprovement of the strong-coupling approximation.

In particular, the next-to-leading order corrections 1) lead to a\ndeviation of \\theta_{23} from maximal mixing, 2) reduce the predicted value of\n$\\sin^2 2\\theta_{13}$ by 9.8%, 3) provide the same value of $\\sin^2\n\\theta_{12}$ as that of the tri-bimaximal mixing. This is shown by calculating\n$\\sin^2 2\\theta_{ij} (i,j=1,2,3)$ to ${\\cal O}(\\lambda^6)$ in the framework in\nwhich the product of the CKM and PMNS matrices is bimaximal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Apr 2013 02:46:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Jul 2013 10:29:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-27"}

So researchers are trying to optimize and\nexpanding its application in the field of education. The aim of this paper is\nto investigate the role of mobile devices and expert systems in disseminating\nand supporting the knowledge gained by intelligent tutors and to propose a\nsystem based on integration of intelligent M-Learning with expert systems. It\nacts as an intelligent tutor which can perform three processes - pre-test,\nlearning concept and post-test - according to characteristic of the learner.\nThe proposed system can improves the education efficiency highly as well as\ndecreases costs. As a result, every time and everywhere (ETEW) simple and cheap\nlearning would be provided via SMS, MMS and so on in this system.
