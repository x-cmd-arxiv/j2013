The lack of a predefined objective precludes premature convergence\ncaused by a deceptive fitness function. In this paper, we apply novelty search\ncombined with NEAT to the evolution of neural controllers for homogeneous\nswarms of robots. Our empirical study is conducted in simulation, and we use a\ncommon swarm robotics task - aggregation, and a more challenging task - sharing\nof an energy recharging station. Our results show that novelty search is\nunaffected by deception, is notably effective in bootstrapping the evolution,\ncan find solutions with lower complexity than fitness-based evolution, and can\nfind a broad diversity of solutions for the same task. Even in non-deceptive\nsetups, novelty search achieves solution qualities similar to those obtained in\ntraditional fitness-based evolution. Our study also encompasses variants of\nnovelty search that work in concert with fitness-based evolution to combine the\nexploratory character of novelty search with the exploitatory character of\nobjective-based evolution. We show that these variants can further improve the\nperformance of novelty search.

The main goal of this work is to present and\ndiscuss the synthetic photometric properties of Single Stellar Populations\n(SSPs) resulting from our POPSTAR code. Colours in the Johnson and SDSS\nsystems, halpha and hbeta luminosities and equivalent widths, and ionising\nregion size, have been computed for a wide range of metallicity (Z = 0.0001 -\n0.05) and age (0.1 Myr to 20 Gyr). We demonstrate the importance of the\ncontribution of emission lines to broader-band photometry when characterising\nstellar populations, through the presentation of both contaminated and\nnon-contaminated colours (in both the Johnson and SDSS systems). The tabulated\ncolours include stellar and nebular components, in addition to line emission.\nThe main application of these models is the determination of physical\nproperties of a given young ionising cluster, when only photometric\nobservations are available; for an isolated star forming region, the young star\ncluster models can be used, free from the contamination of any underlying\nbackground stellar population. In most cases, however, the ionising population\nis usually embedded in a large and complex system, and the observed photometric\nproperties result from the combination of a young star-forming burst and the\nunderlying older population of the host. Therefore, the second objective of\nthis paper is to provide a grid of models useful in the interpretation of mixed\nregions where the separation of young and old populations is not sufficiently\nreliable. We describe the set of PopStar Spectral Energy Distributions, the\nderived colours and other photometric parameters, for mixed populations where\nan underlying host population is combined in different mass ratios with a\nrecent ionising burst.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Apr 2013 17:10:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

In existing studies, however, the experimenter\nhad to craft a domain dependent behaviour similarity measure to use novelty\nsearch in swarm robotics applications. The reliance on hand-crafted similarity\nmeasures places an additional burden to the experimenter and introduces a bias\nin the evolutionary process. In this paper, we propose and compare two\ntask-independent, generic behaviour similarity measures: combined state count\nand sampled average state. The proposed measures use the values of sensors and\neffectors recorded for each individual robot of the swarm. The characterisation\nof the group-level behaviour is then obtained by combining the sensor-effector\nvalues from all the robots. We evaluate the proposed measures in an aggregation\ntask and in a resource sharing task. We show that the generic measures match\nthe performance of domain dependent measures in terms of solution quality. Our\nresults indicate that the proposed generic measures operate as effective\nbehaviour similarity measures, and that it is possible to leverage the benefits\nof novelty search without having to craft domain specific similarity measures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Apr 2013 18:58:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-14"}

This is done by considering\ntwo-component models, as these are the simplest approximation of more realistic\nmulti-mass systems, where one component represents the BH population and the\nother represents all the other stars. These systems are found to undergo a long\nphase of evolution where the centre of the system is dominated by a dense BH\nsub-system. After mass segregation has driven most of the BH into a compact\nsub-system, the evolution of the BH sub-system is found to be influenced by the\ncluster in which it is contained. The BH sub-system evolves in such a way as to\nsatisfy the energy demands of the whole cluster, just as the core of a one\ncomponent system must satisfy the energy demands of the whole cluster. The BH\nsub-system is found to exist for a significant amount of time. It takes\napproximately 10t_{rh,i}, where t_{rh,i} is the initial half-mass relaxation\ntime, from the formation of the compact BH sub-system up until the time when\n90% of the sub-system total mass is lost (which is of order 10^{3} times the\nhalf-mass relaxation time of the BH sub-system at its time of formation). Based\non theoretical arguments the rate of mass loss from the BH sub-system\n(\\dot{M}_2) is predicted to be -(beta*zeta*M)/(alpha*t_{rh}), where M is the\ntotal mass, t_{rh} is the half-mass relaxation time, and alpha, beta, zeta are\nthree dimensionless parameters (see Section 2 for details). An interesting\nconsequence of this is that the rate of mass loss from the BH sub-system is\napproximately independent of the stellar mass ratio (m_2/m_1) and the total\nmass ratio (M_2/M_1) (in the range m_2/m_1 >~ 10 and M_2/M_1 ~ 10^{-2}, where\nm_1, m_2 are the masses of individual low-mass and high-mass particles\nrespectively, and M_1, M_2 are the corresponding total masses).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Apr 2013 19:21:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

For twelve of these sources, deeper 1.4 GHz MERLIN+VLA\nobservations at the same spatial resolution are available, allowing radio\nspectral indices to be derived for ten sources on sub-arcsec angular scales.\nVia analysis of the spectral indices and radio morphologies, these sources have\nbeen identified as AGN cores in moderate-to-high redshift (1<z<4) galaxies.\nThese results have provided AGN (or AGN candidate) classification for six\npreviously unclassified sources and confirmed the AGN nature of the rest of the\nsample. Ultimately the eMERGE project will image the GOODS-N region at 1.4 and\n5 GHz with higher resolution (about 50 mas at 5 GHz) and down to sub-microJy\nsensitivities. The unique combination of sensitivity and spatial resolution\nwill be exploited to study star formation and AGN activity in distant galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Apr 2013 19:33:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

Our first result is the\nCohen-Macaulayness property (as modules over the polynomial ring) of Cherednik\nalgebra modules with minimal support. Our second result is an explicit formula\nfor the character of an irreducible minimal support module in type A_{n-1} for\nc=m/n, and an expression of its quasispherical part (i.e., the isotypic part of\n\"hooks\") in terms of the HOMFLY polynomial of a torus knot colored by a Young\ndiagram. We use this formula and the work of Calaque, Enriquez and Etingof to\ngive explicit formulas for the characters of the irreducible equivariant\nD-modules on the nilpotent cone for SL_m. Our third result is the construction\nof the Koszul-BGG complex for the rational Cherednik algebra, which generalizes\nthe construction of the Koszul-BGG resolution by Berest-Etingof-Ginzburg and\nGordon, and the calculation of its homology in type A. We also show in type A\nthat the differentials in the Koszul-BGG complex are uniquely determined by the\ncondition that they are nonzero homomorphisms of modules over the Cherednik\nalgebra. Finally, our fourth result is the symmetry theorem, which identifies\nthe quasispherical components in the representations with minimal support over\nthe rational Cherednik algebras H_{m/n}(S_n) and H_{n/m}(S_m). In fact, we show\nthat the simple quotients of the corresponding quasispherical subalgebras are\nisomorphic as filtered algebras.

HD 150136 is a triple hierarchical system and a non-thermal radio\nemitter. It is formed by an O3-3.5 V + O5.5-6 V close binary and a more distant\nO6.5-7 V tertiary. So far, only the inner orbital properties have been reliably\nconstrained.\n  Aims. To quantitatively understand the non-thermal emission process, accurate\nknowledge of the physical and orbital properties of the object is crucial.\nHere, we aim to investigate the orbital properties of the wide system and to\nconstrain the inclinations of the inner and outer binaries, and with these the\nabsolute masses of the system components.\n  Methods. We used the PIONIER combiner at the Very Large Telescope\nInterferometer to obtain the very first interferometric measurements of HD\n150136. We combined the interferometric observations with new and existing high\nresolution spectroscopic data to derive the orbital solution of the outer\ncompanion in the three-dimensional space.\n  Results. The wide system is clearly resolved by PIONIER, with a projected\nseparation on the plane of the sky of about 9 milli-arcsec. The best-fit\norbital period, eccentricity, and inclination are 8.2 yr, 0.73 and 108 degr. We\nconstrain the masses of the three stars of the system to 63 +/- 10, 40 +/- 6,\nand 33 +/- 12 Msun for the O3-3.5 V, O5.5-6 V and O6.5-7 V components.\n  Conclusions. The dynamical masses agree within errors with the evolutionary\nmasses of the components. Future interferometric and spectroscopic monitoring\nof HD 150136 should allow one to reduce the uncertainties to a few per cent\nonly and to accurately constrain the distance to the system. This makes HD\n150136 an ideal system to quantitatively test evolutionary models of high-mass\nstars as well as the physics of non-thermal processes occurring in O-type\nsystems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Apr 2013 20:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

These electrons have been recently shown\nto exhibit a large spin-orbit coupling of the Rashba type, i.e., linear in the\nin-plane momentum. In this paper we study the intrinsic spin Hall effect due to\nRashba coupling in an asymmetric triangular potential well. Besides splitting\neach subband into two branches of opposite helicity, the spin-orbit interaction\ncauses the wave function in the direction perpendicular to the plane of the\nquantum well (the z direction) to depend on the in-plane wave vector k. In\ncontrast to the extreme asymmetric case, i.e., the wedge-shaped quantum well,\nfor which the intrinsic spin Hall effect vanishes due to vertex corrections, we\nfind that the asymmetric well supports a non-vanishing intrinsic spin Hall\nconductivity, which increases in magnitude as the well becomes more symmetric.\nThe spin Hall conductivity is found to be proportional to the square of the\nspin-orbit coupling constant and, in the limit of low carrier density, depends\nonly on the effective mass renormalization associated with the k-dependence of\nthe wave functions in the z direction.

The\ntechnique exploits the sensitivity of certain optical lines to changes in\ndepletion of metals onto dust grains and uses photo-ionization models to\nconstrain these physical ratios along with the metallicity (Z) and dust column\ndensity. We compare our gas column density estimates with HI and CO gas mass\nestimates in nearby galaxies to show that we recover their total gas mass\nsurface density to within a factor of 2 up to a total surface gas mass density\nof ~75 Mo/pc^2. Our technique is independent of the conversion factor of CO to\nH2 and we show that a Z-dependent XCO is required to achieve good agreement\nbetween our measurements and that provided by CO and HI. However we also show\nthat our method can not be reliably aperture corrected to total gas mass. We\ncalculate dust-to-gas ratios for all star-forming galaxies in the SDSS DR7 and\nshow the resulting dependence on Z agrees well with the trend inferred from\nmodelling of the dust emission of nearby galaxies using FIR data. We also\npresent estimates of the variation of the dust-to-metal ratio with Z and show\nthat this is poorly constrained at Z<~0.5Z_sun. We end with a study of the\ninventory of gas in the central regions, defined both in terms of a fixed\nphysical radius and as a fixed fraction of the half-light radius, of ~70,000\nstar-forming galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We show that their\ncentral gas content and gas depletion times are not accurately predicted by a\nsingle parameter, but in agreement with recent studies we find that a\ncombination of the M* and some measure of central concentration provides a good\npredictor of gas content in galaxies. We also identify a population of galaxies\nwith low surface densities of stars and very long gas depletion times.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Apr 2013 21:25:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

RDS typically leads to biased sampling, favoring participants with\nmany acquaintances. Naive estimates, such as the sample average, which are\nuncorrected for the sampling bias, will themselves be biased. To compensate for\nthis bias, current methodology suggests inverse-degree weighting, where the\n\"degree\" is the number of acquaintances. This stems from the fundamental RDS\nassumption that the probability of sampling an individual is proportional to\ntheir degree. Since this assumption is tenuous at best, we propose to harness\nthe additional information encapsulated in the time of recruitment, into a\nmodel-based inference framework for RDS. This information is typically\ncollected by researchers, but ignored. We adapt methods developed for inference\nin epidemic processes to estimate the population size, degree counts and\nfrequencies. While providing valuable information in themselves, these\nquantities ultimately serve to debias other estimators, such a disease's\nprevalence. A fundamental advantage of our approach is that, being model-based,\nit makes all assumptions of the data-generating process explicit. This enables\nverification of the assumptions, maximum likelihood estimation, extension with\ncovariates, and model selection. We develop asymptotic theory, proving\nconsistency and asymptotic normality properties. We further compare these\nestimators to the standard inverse-degree weighting through simulations, and\nusing real-world data. In both cases we find our estimators to outperform\ncurrent methods.

A fading of the optical-infrared (IR) flux occurred\nas the source entered the hard-intermediate state, followed by a brightening as\nit returned to the hard state. The optical-IR spectrum was consistent with a\npower law from optically thin synchrotron emission, except when the X-ray\nspectrum was softest. By fitting the radio to optical spectra with a broken\npower law, we constrain the frequency and flux of the optically thick/thin\nbreak in the jet synchrotron spectrum. The break gradually shifted to higher\nfrequencies as the source hardened at X-ray energies, from ~ 10^11 to ~ 4 x\n10^13 Hz. The radiative jet luminosity integrated over the spectrum appeared to\nbe greatest when the source entered the hard state during the outburst decay\n(although this is dependent on the high energy cooling break, which is not seen\ndirectly), even though the radio flux was fading at the time. The physical\nprocess responsible for suppressing and reactivating the jet (neither of which\nare instantaneous but occur on timescales of weeks) is uncertain, but could\narise from the varying inner accretion disk radius regulating the fraction of\naccreting matter that is channeled into the jet. This provides an unprecedented\ninsight into the connection between inflow and outflow, and has implications\nfor the conditions required for jets to be produced, and hence their launching\nprocess.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Apr 2013 23:47:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

To date,\ntip-driven growth processes have been modelled as an elongating path or series\nof segments without taking into account lateral expansion during elongation.\nInstead, models of growth often introduce an explicit thickness by expanding\nthe area around the completed elongated path. Modelling expansion in this way\ncan lead to contradictions in the physical plausibility of the resulting\nsurface and to uncertainty about how the object reached certain regions of\nspace. Here, we introduce \"fiber walks\" as a self-avoiding random walk model\nfor tip-driven growth processes that includes lateral expansion. In 2D, the\nfiber walk takes place on a square lattice and the space occupied by the fiber\nis modelled as a lateral contraction of the lattice. This contraction\ninfluences the possible follow-up steps of the fiber walk. The boundary of the\narea consumed by the contraction is derived as the dual of the lattice faces\nadjacent to the fiber. We show that fiber walks generate fibers that have\nwell-defined curvatures, enable the identification of the process underlying\nthe occupancy of physical space.

However, it has been pointed out that the initial seed laser\nnoise will be amplified by the frequency up-conversion process, which may\ndegrade the quality of the output radiation produced by a harmonic generation\nscheme. In this paper, theoretical and simulation studies for laser phase error\namplification in seeded FEL schemes with slippage effect taken into account are\npresented. It is found that, the seed laser imperfection experienced by the\nelectron beam can be significantly smoothed by the slippage effect in the\nmodulator when the slippage length is comparable to the laser pulse length.\nThis smoothing effect allows one to preserve the excellent temporal coherence\nof seeded FELs in presence of large laser phase errors. For ultra-short UV seed\nlasers with FWHM around 16 fs, the slippage length in a modulator with ~30\nundulator periods is typically comparable to the laser width; for longer seed\nlaser pulses with FWHM around 80 fs, the slippage length can be made comparable\nto the laser width using a modulator tuned at the sub-harmonic of the UV seed\nlaser. Three-dimensional simulations have been carried out for a soft x-ray\nfacility using seed laser pulses with large frequency chirp and the results\nshow that the sensitivity of the bandwidth of the seeded FEL to the initial\nfrequency chirp can be significantly reduced by a proper design of the\nmodulator such that the slippage length is comparable to the laser width. Our\nstudies show that the tolerance on laser phase error for generating nearly\ntransform-limited soft x-ray pulses in seeded FELs is much looser than\npreviously thought and fully coherent radiation at nanometer wavelength may be\nreached with current technologies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Apr 2013 08:10:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-15"}

One of the most frequent defects in astronomical\nimaging is the presence of additive noise which makes a denoising step\nmandatory before processing data. During the last decade, a particular modeling\nscheme, based on sparse representations, has drawn the attention of an ever\ngrowing community of researchers. Sparse representations offer a promising\nframework to many image and signal processing tasks, especially denoising and\nrestoration applications. At first, the harmonics, wavelets, and similar bases\nand overcomplete representations have been considered as candidate domains to\nseek the sparsest representation. A new generation of algorithms, based on\ndata-driven dictionaries, evolved rapidly and compete now with the\noff-the-shelf fixed dictionaries. While designing a dictionary beforehand leans\non a guess of the most appropriate representative elementary forms and\nfunctions, the dictionary learning framework offers to construct the dictionary\nupon the data themselves, which provides us with a more flexible setup to\nsparse modeling and allows to build more sophisticated dictionaries. In this\npaper, we introduce the Centered Dictionary Learning (CDL) method and we study\nits performances for astronomical image denoising. We show how CDL outperforms\nwavelet or classic dictionary learning denoising techniques on astronomical\nimages, and we give a comparison of the effect of these different algorithms on\nthe photometry of the denoised images.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Apr 2013 08:57:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

It is found that superconductivity is not enhanced\nby annealing under high vacuum (~ 10^(-3) Pa) or by annealing in a sealed\nevacuated quartz tube. In a moderate vacuum atmosphere (~ 1 Pa), iron oxide\nlayers are found to show up on sample surfaces, which would draw excess Fe out\nof the crystal. Thus, it is suggested that remanent oxygen effectively works to\nremove excess Fe from the matrix of Fe(Se,Te) crystals, resulting improvement\nof superconducting transition temperature. Our transport measurements suggest\nthat the excess Fe scatters the carriers on electron- and hole-type channels in\na different manner. We discuss how the mobility of two types of carriers\ncorrelate with superconductivity. Since both the electron and hole bands are\nimportant for the occurrence of superconductivity, excess Fe would suppress\nsuperconductivity mainly due to strong scattering of electrons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Apr 2013 10:13:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-14"}

The quantitative study of sustainability transitions\nrequires modelling work, which necessitates a theory of technology\nsubstitution. Many, if not most, contemporary modelling approaches for future\ntechnology pathways overlook most aspects of transitions theory, for instance\ndimensions of heterogenous investor choices, dynamic rates of diffusion and the\nprofile of transitions. A significant body of literature however exists that\ndemonstrates how transitions follow S-shaped diffusion curves or Lotka-Volterra\nsystems of equations. This framework is used ex-post since timescales can only\nbe reliably obtained in cases where the transitions have already occurred,\nprecluding its use for studying cases of interest where nascent innovations in\nprotective niches await favourable conditions for their diffusion.

In this context, this paper presents a theory framework for\nevaluating the parameterisation of S-shaped diffusion curves for use in\nsimulation models of technology transitions without the involvement of\nhistorical data fitting, making use of standard demography theory applied to\ntechnology at the unit level. The classic Lotka-Volterra competition system\nemerges from first principles from demography theory, its timescales explained\nin terms of technology lifetimes and industrial dynamics.

Since the resultant proton lifetime\nlies in the regions which may be reached in the future experiments, proton\ndecay searches may give us a chance to verify the scenario as well as the\nsupersymmetric grand unified models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Apr 2013 14:43:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 Jul 2013 02:53:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-15"}
