The GMsFEM, which has been\nrecently introduced in [12], allows solving multiscale parameter-dependent\nproblems at a reduced computational cost by constructing a reduced-order\nrepresentation of the solution on a coarse grid. The main idea of the method\nconsists of (1) the construction of snapshot space, (2) the construction of the\noffline space, and (3) construction of the online space (the latter for\nparameter-dependent problems). In [12], it was shown that the GMsFEM provides a\nflexible tool to solve multiscale problems with a complex input space by\ngenerating appropriate snapshot, offline, and online spaces. In this paper, we\ndevelop oversampling techniques to be used in this context (see [19] where\noversampling is introduced for multiscale finite element methods). It is known\n(see [19]) that the oversampling can improve the accuracy of multiscale\nmethods. In particular, the oversampling technique uses larger regions (larger\nthan the target coarse block) in constructing local basis functions. Our\nmotivation stems from the analysis presented in this paper which show that when\nusing oversampling techniques in the construction of the snapshot space and\noffline space, GMsFEM will converge independent of small scales and\nhigh-contrast under certain assumptions. We consider the use of multiple\neigenvalue problem to improve the convergence and discuss their relation to\nsingle spectral problems that use oversampled regions. The oversampling\nprocedures proposed in this paper differ from those in [19]. In particular, the\noversampling domains are partially used in constructing local spectral\nproblems. We present numerical results and compare various oversampling\ntechniques in order to complement the proposed technique and analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Apr 2013 17:01:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-18"}

Yet to punish is costly, and the\ncosts often do not offset the gains that are due to elevated levels of\ncooperation.

Using\nthe snowdrift game as the basis, we have conducted a series of economic\nexperiments to determine whether severe punishment is more effective than mild\npunishment. We have observed that severe punishment is not necessarily more\neffective, even if the cost of punishment is identical in both cases.

We also test the 3D models\nfor the intensity distribution of the granulation and spectral line shapes. The\npredictions from the 3D model are in excellent agreement with the continuum CLV\nobservations, performing even better than the Holweger & M\\\"uller model\n(constructed largely to fulfil such observations). The predictions of the 1D\ntheoretical models are worse, given their steeper temperature gradients. For\nthe continuum fluxes, predictions for most models agree well with the\nobservations. No model fits all hydrogen lines perfectly, but again the 3D\nmodel comes ahead. The 3D model also reproduces the observed continuum\nintensity fluctuations and spectral line shapes very well. The excellent\nagreement of the 3D model with the observables reinforces the view that its\ntemperature structure is realistic. It outperforms the MHD simulation in all\ndiagnostics, implying that recent claims for revised abundances based on MHD\nmodelling are premature. Several weaknesses in the 1D models are exposed.

The\nelectron fraction is set by the aboriginal composition of the white dwarf and\nthe reactions that occur during the pre explosive convective burning. To date,\ndetermining the makeup of the white dwarf progenitor has relied on indirect\nproxies, such as the average metallicity of the host stellar population. In\nthis paper, we present analytical calculations supporting the idea that the\nelectron fraction of the progenitor systematically influences the\nnucleosynthesis of silicon group ejecta in Type Ia supernovae. In particular,\nwe suggest the abundances generated in quasi nuclear statistical equilibrium\nare preserved during the subsequent freezeout. This allows one to potential\nrecovery of Ye at explosion from the abundances recovered from an observed\nspectra. We show that measurement of 28Si, 32S, 40Ca, and 54Fe abundances can\nbe used to construct Ye in the silicon rich regions of the supernovae. If these\nfour abundances are determined exactly, they are sufficient to recover Ye to 6\npercent. This is because these isotopes dominate the composition of\nsilicon-rich material and iron rich material in quasi nuclear statistical\nequilibrium. Analytical analysis shows that the 28Si abundance is insensitive\nto Ye, the 32S abundance has a nearly linear trend with Ye, and the 40Ca\nabundance has a nearly quadratic trend with Ye. We verify these trends with\npost-processing of 1D models and show that these trends are reflected in model\nsynthetic spectra.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Apr 2013 20:00:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 May 2014 17:29:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

In order to investigate the\nline profiles from dynamical collapsing massive star forming regions (MSFRs),\nwe model the emission from hydrodynamic simulations of a collapsing cloud in\nthe absence of outflows. By performing radiative transfer calculations, we\ncompute the optically thick HCO+ and optically thin N2H+ line profiles from two\ncollapsing regions at different epochs. Due to large-scale collapse, the MSFRs\nhave large velocity gradients, reaching up to 20 km/s/pc across the central\ncore. The optically thin lines typically contain multiple velocity components\nresulting from the superposition of numerous density peaks along the\nline-of-sight. The optically thick lines are only marginally shifted to the\nblue side of the optically thin line profiles, and frequently do not have a\ncentral depression in their profiles due to self-absorption. As the regions\nevolve the lines become brighter and the optically thick lines become broader.\nThe lower order HCO+ (1-0) transitions are better indicators of collapse than\nthe higher order (4-3) transitions. We also investigate how the beam sizes\naffect profile shapes. Smaller beams lead to brighter and narrower lines that\nare more skewed to the blue in HCO+ relative to the true core velocity, but\nshow multiple components in N2H+.

If the\ntime lag is fairly short, the interaction of the supernova ejecta with the\ntails could lead to detectable shock emission at radio, optical, and/or x-ray\nwavelengths. At somewhat later times, the tails produce relatively broad NaID\nabsorption lines with velocity widths of order the white dwarf escape speed\n($\\sim 1000$ \\kms).

The fragmentation of self-gravitating\nprotostellar discs into gravitationally bound embryos - with masses of a few to\ntens of Jupiter masses, at semi major axes above 30 - 40 au - is followed by\ngrain sedimentation inside the embryo, radial migration towards the central\nstar and tidal disruption of the embryo's upper layers. The properties of the\nresultant object depends sensitively on the timescales upon which each process\noccurs. Therefore, GI followed by tidal downsizing can theoretically produce\nobjects spanning a large mass range, from terrestrial planets to giant planets\nand brown dwarfs. Whether such objects can be formed in practice, and what\nproportions of the observed population they would represent, requires a more\ninvolved statistical analysis.\n  We present a simple population synthesis model of star and planet formation\nvia GI and tidal downsizing. We couple a semi-analytic model of protostellar\ndisc evolution to analytic calculations of fragmentation, initial embryo mass,\ngrain growth and sedimentation, embryo migration and tidal disruption. While\nthere are key pieces of physics yet to be incorporated, it represents a first\nstep towards a mature statistical model of GI and tidal downsizing as a mode of\nstar and planet formation.\n  We show results from four runs of the population synthesis model, varying the\nopacity law and the strength of migration, as well as investigating the effect\nof disc truncation during the fragmentation process. Our early results suggest\nthat GI plus tidal downsizing is not the principal mode of planet formation,\nbut remains an excellent means of forming gas giant planets, brown dwarfs and\nlow mass stars at large semimajor axes.

The OHCP is\nNP-complete, but if the boundary matrix of K is totally unimodular (TU), it\nbecomes solvable in polynomial time when modeled as a linear program (LP). We\ndefine a condition on the simplicial complex called non total-unimodularity\nneutralized, or NTU neutralized, which ensures that even when the boundary\nmatrix is not TU, the OHCP LP must contain an integral optimal vertex for every\ninput chain. This condition is a property of K, and is independent of the input\nchain and the weights on the simplices. This condition is strictly weaker than\nthe boundary matrix being TU.

The change\nin the intensity and the peak position of one of these two components gives\ninsight into the dependence of the overall Raman 2D peak features as a function\nof the angle \\theta. Additionally, we show regions in the phonon spectrum\ngiving rise to the Raman 2D peak signal. This work provides an insight into the\ninterplay between the mechanical degree of freedom (angle \\theta) and the\nelectronic degrees of freedom (singularities in the density of states) in\nrotated double-layer graphene. Additionally, this work provides a way to\nestablish experimentally the value of the rotation angle \\theta using Raman\nspectroscopy measurement. This procedure becomes even more robust if one\nrepeats the Raman spectroscopy measurement with a different incoming photon\nenergy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Apr 2013 01:28:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 1 Nov 2013 20:02:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-05"}

Several computational mechanisms have been proposed to account for such\nisochronous synchronization in the presence of long conduction delays: Of\nthese, the phenomenon of \"dynamical relaying\" - a mechanism that relies on a\nspecific network motif - has proven to be the most robust with respect to\nparameter mismatch and system noise. Surprisingly, despite a contrary belief in\nthe community, the common driving motif is an unreliable means of establishing\nzero-lag synchrony. Although dynamical relaying has been validated in empirical\nand computational studies, the deeper dynamical mechanisms and comparison to\ndynamics on other motifs is lacking. By systematically comparing\nsynchronization on a variety of small motifs, we establish that the presence of\na single reciprocally connected pair - a \"resonance pair\" - plays a crucial\nrole in disambiguating those motifs that foster zero-lag synchrony in the\npresence of conduction delays (such as dynamical relaying) from those that do\nnot (such as the common driving triad). Remarkably, minor structural changes to\nthe common driving motif that incorporate a reciprocal pair recover robust\nzero-lag synchrony. The findings are observed in computational models of\nspiking neurons, populations of spiking neurons and neural mass models, and\narise whether the oscillatory systems are periodic, chaotic, noise-free or\ndriven by stochastic inputs. The influence of the resonance pair is also robust\nto parameter mismatch and asymmetrical time delays amongst the elements of the\nmotif. We call this manner of facilitating zero-lag synchrony resonance-induced\nsynchronization, outline the conditions for its occurrence, and propose that it\nmay be a general mechanism to promote zero-lag synchrony in the brain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Apr 2013 02:20:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 25 Jan 2014 02:49:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-07"}

While much effort has been devoted to understanding the flapping\nkinematics and its influence on the swimming efficiency, little is known about\nthe stability (or lack of) of periodic swimming. It is believed that stability\nlimits maneuverability and body designs/flapping motions that are adapted for\nstable swimming are not suitable for high maneuverability and vice versa. In\nthis paper, we consider a simplified model of a planar elliptic body undergoing\nprescribed periodic heaving and pitching in potential flow. We show that\nperiodic locomotion can be achieved due to the resulting hydrodynamic forces,\nand its value depends on several parameters including the aspect ratio of the\nbody, the amplitudes and phases of the prescribed flapping. We obtain\nclosed-form solutions for the locomotion and efficiency for small flapping\namplitudes, and numerical results for finite flapping amplitudes. We then study\nthe stability of the (finite amplitude flapping) periodic locomotion using\nFloquet theory. We find that stability depends nonlinearly on all parameters.\nInteresting trends of switching between stable and unstable motions emerge and\nevolve as we continuously vary the parameter values. This suggests that, for\nlive organisms that control their flapping motion, maneuverability and\nstability need not be thought of as disjoint properties, rather the organism\nmay manipulate its motion in favor of one or the other depending on the task at\nhand.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Apr 2013 08:10:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Apr 2013 19:22:29 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 28 Jun 2013 17:26:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

The impact of\nintroducing a central counterparty (CCP) on expected interdealer exposure is\ndetermined by the tradeoff between multilateral netting across dealers on one\nhand and bilateral netting across asset classes on the other hand. We find this\ntradeoff to be sensitive to assumptions on heterogeneity of asset classes in\nterms of `riskyness' of the asset class as well as correlation of exposures\nacross asset classes. In particular, while an analysis assuming independent,\nhomogeneous exposures suggests that central clearing is efficient only if one\nhas an unrealistically high number of participants, the opposite conclusion is\nreached if differences in riskyness and correlation across asset classes are\nrealistically taken into account. We argue that empirically plausible\nspecifications of model parameters lead to the conclusion that central clearing\ndoes reduce interdealer exposures: the gain from multilateral netting in a CCP\noverweighs the loss of netting across asset classes in bilateral netting\nagreements. When a CCP exists for interest rate derivatives, adding a CCP for\ncredit derivatives is shown to decrease overall exposures.

The Mott\ninsulator (MI) phase then is the region in the phase diagram where no SF\nclusters exist, and the SF phase the region, where SF clusters percolate - the\nBG phase is in between: SF clusters exist, but do not percolate.

Inflation traces back all the inhomogeneities to quantum fluctuations\nalthough the structures look classical today. Squeezing of primordial quantum\nfluctuations along with the mechanism of decoherence accounts for many aspects\nof this quantum to classical transition, although it remains a matter of debate\nas to whether this is sufficient to explain the issue of realization of a\nsingle outcome (i.e. the issue of macro-objectification) from a quantum\nensemble given that the universe is a closed system. A similar question of\nemergence of classical behavior of macroscopic objects exists also for\nlaboratory systems and apart from decoherence there have been attempts to\nresolve this issue through Continuous Spontaneous Localization (CSL), which is\na stochastic nonlinear modification of the non-relativistic Schr\\\"{o}dinger\nequation. Recently, Martin {\\it et al.} have investigated whether a CSL-like\nmechanism with a constant strength parameter, when the Mukhanov-Sasaki variable\nis taken as the \"collapse-operator\", can explain how the primordial quantum\nperturbations generated during inflation become classical. Within the scope of\ntheir assumptions they essentially come to a negative conclusion. In the\npresent work, we generalize their analysis by allowing the CSL strength\nparameter to depend on physical scales so as to capture the CSL amplification\nmechanism. We show that such a generalization provides a mechanism for\nmacro-objectification (i.e. classicalization) of the inflationary quantum\nperturbations, while also preserving scale invariance of the power spectrum and\nphase coherence of super-horizon perturbation modes in a particular class of\nthese models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Apr 2013 12:09:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 Sep 2013 05:32:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-18"}

This growing capability, facilitated by modern\ncommunication technology, is highly relevant to endeavors which require the\nsearch for individuals that posses rare information or skill, such as finding\nmedical doctors during disasters, or searching for missing people. An open\nquestion remains, as to whether in time-critical situations, people are able to\nrecruit in a targeted manner, or whether they resort to so-called blind search,\nrecruiting as many acquaintances as possible via broadcast communication. To\nexplore this question, we examine data from our recent success in the U.S.\nState Department's Tag Challenge, which required locating and photographing 5\ntarget persons in 5 different cities in the United States and Europe in less\nthan 12 hours, based only on a single mug-shot. We find that people are able to\nconsistently route information in a targeted fashion even under increasing time\npressure. We derive an analytical model for global mobilization and use it to\nquantify the extent to which people were targeting others during recruitment.\nOur model estimates that approximately 1 in 3 messages were of targeted fashion\nduring the most time-sensitive period of the challenge.This is a novel\nobservation at such short temporal scales, and calls for opportunities for\ndevising viral incentive schemes that provide distance- or time-sensitive\nrewards to approach the target geography more rapidly, with applications in\nmultiple areas from emergency preparedness, to political mobilization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Apr 2013 12:15:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 20 Apr 2013 10:02:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 6 Apr 2014 20:56:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-08"}

Nevertheless, these indicators\nare not comparable among fields of science for two reasons: (i) each field has\na different impact maturity time, and (ii) because of systematic differences in\npublication and citation behaviour across disciplines. In fact, the 5-JIF\nfirstly appeared in the Journal Citation Reports (JCR) in 2007 with the purpose\nof making more comparable impacts in fields in which impact matures slowly.\nHowever, there is not an optimal fixed impact maturity time valid for all the\nfields.

Therefore, there is a problem when comparing\na journal from a field in which impact matures slowly with a journal from a\nfield in which impact matures rapidly. In this work, we propose the 2-year\nmaximum journal impact factor (2M-JIF), a new impact indicator that considers\nthe 2-year rolling citation time window of maximum impact instead of the\nprevious 2-year time window. Finally, an empirical application comparing 2-JIF,\n5-JIF, and 2M-JIF shows that the maximum rolling target window reduces the\nbetween-group variance with respect to the within-group variance in a random\nsample of about six hundred journals from eight different fields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Apr 2013 12:21:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-19"}

Using a GEANT4\nmodeling of the detector ICAL, interactions of atmospheric neutrinos with\ntarget nuclei are simulated. The detector response to hadrons propagating\nthrough it is investigated using the hadron hit multiplicity in the active\ndetector elements. The detector response to charged pions of fixed energy is\nstudied first, followed by the average response to the hadrons produced in\natmospheric neutrino interactions using events simulated with the NUANCE event\ngenerator. The shape of the hit distribution is observed to fit the Vavilov\ndistribution, which reduces to a Gaussian at high energies. In terms of the\nparameters of this distribution, we present the hadron energy resolution as a\nfunction of hadron energy, and the calibration of hadron energy as a function\nof the hit multiplicity. The energy resolution for hadrons is found to be in\nthe range 85% (for 1GeV) -- 36% (for 15 GeV).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Apr 2013 13:05:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 30 Oct 2013 08:58:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-13"}

While the scattering process is governed by the S-matrix the\ninteraction evolves the produced state rho_f(S) to observed state rho_f(O). To\nbe consistent with the Standard Model this new interaction must be a pure\ndephasing interaction governed by a non-unitary evolution law modifying the\nphases of the amplitudes. We present the first test of the unitary evolution\nlaw in particle scattering. The unitary evolution law evolves pure initial\nstates into pure final states in exclusive processes. This fact leads to 9\nindependent constraints on 16 components of angular intensities in piN->pipiN\nprocesses. When expressed in terms of P-parity conserving transversity\namplitudes all 9 constraints are identities provided a single constrain on the\ntransversity amplitudes holds true. The constraint implies that the relative\nphases between transverity amplitudes of the same naturality and transversity\nmust be 0 or +/- pi.

We discuss important topics such as the\nsignificance of the non-invasive measurability assumption, the clumsiness\nloophole, and the role of weak measurements. Also covered are some recent\ntheoretical proposals for the application of Leggett-Garg inequalities in\nquantum transport, quantum biology and nano-mechanical systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Apr 2013 13:46:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 2 Aug 2013 08:14:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 30 Jan 2014 19:35:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-31"}

Such linewidths and\ntemperatures for these quiescent starless cores in the surroundings of massive\nstars are still significantly larger than the typical values measured in\nstarless cores of low-mass star-forming regions, implying an important\nnon-thermal component. We confirm at high angular resolutions the correlations\npreviously found with single-dish telescopes between the linewidth, the\ntemperature of the cores, and the bolometric luminosity. In addition, we find a\ncorrelation between the temperature of each core and the incident flux from the\nmost massive star in the cluster, suggesting that the large temperatures\nmeasured in the starless cores of our sample could be due to heating from the\nnearby massive star.

Uno and M.Yagiura (Algorithmica, 26:290:309, 2000),\nwho proposed an efficient algorithm to find common intervals when K=2. Several\nparticular classes of intervals have been defined since then, e.g. conserved\nintervals and nested common intervals, with applications mainly in genome\ncomparison. Each such class, including common intervals, led to the development\nof a specific algorithmic approach for K=2, and - except for nested common\nintervals - for its extension to an arbitrary K.\n  In this paper, we propose a common and efficient algorithmic framework for\nfinding different types of common intervals in a set P of K permutations, with\narbitrary K. Our generic algorithm is based on a global representation of the\ninformation stored in P, called the MinMax-profile of P, and an efficient data\nstructure, called an LR-stack, that we introduce here. We show that common\nintervals (and their subclasses of irreducible common intervals and same-sign\ncommon intervals), nested common intervals (and their subclass of maximal\nnested common intervals) as well as conserved intervals (and their subclass of\nirreducible conserved intervals) may be obtained by appropriately setting the\nparameters of our algorithm in each case.

Accordingly, in this work, we\nseek to identify a physically sound upper limit to planetary radii at low\nmasses and moderate equilibrium temperatures. As a guiding example, we analyze\nthe interior structure of the Neptune-mass planet Kepler-30d and show that it\nis acutely deficient in heavy elements, especially compared with its solar\nsystem counterparts. Subsequently, we perform numerical simulations of\nplanetary thermal evolution and in agreement with previous studies, show that\ngenerally, 10 - 20 Earth mass, multi-billion year old planets, composed of high\ndensity cores and extended H/He envelopes can have radii that firmly reside in\nthe giant planet range.

Our aim was to study\nboth theoretically and experimentally its reaction-diffusion mechanism to find\nthe source of that selectivity. Methods ClO2 permeation measurements through\nprotein membranes were performed and the time delay of ClO2 transport due to\nreaction and diffusion was determined. To calculate ClO2 penetration depths and\nestimate bacterial killing times, approximate solutions of the\nreaction-diffusion equation were derived. Additionally, as a preliminary test,\nthree patients with infected wounds were treated with a 300 ppm high purity\nClO2 solution and the healing process was documented. Results The rate law of\nthe reaction-diffusion model predicts that the killing time is proportional to\nthe square of the characteristic size (e.g. diameter) of a body, thus, small\nones will be killed extremely fast. For example, the killing time for a\nbacterium is on the order of milliseconds in a 300 ppm ClO2 solution. Thus, the\nfew minutes of contact time (owing to the volatility of ClO2) is quite enough\nto kill all bacteria, but short enough to keep ClO2 penetration into the living\ntissues safely below 0.1 mm, minimizing cytotoxic effects. Pictures of\nsuccessful wound healings confirm these considerations. Various properties of\nClO2, advantageous for an antiseptic, are also discussed. Most importantly,\nbacteria are not able to develop resistance against ClO2 as it reacts with\nbiological thiols which play a vital role in all living organisms. Conclusion\nSelectivity of ClO2 between humans and bacteria is based not on their different\nbiochemistry, but on their different size. Preliminary clinical results\nencourage further research with this promising local antiseptic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Apr 2013 15:27:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-19"}

This observational fact has cast significant doubts on the\nimportance of disk-driven migration as a mechanism for production of hot\nJupiters, thereby reestablishing the origins of close-in planetary orbits as an\nopen question. Here we show that misaligned orbits can be a natural consequence\nof disk migration.

We analyze the\ndynamical evolution of idealized proto-planetary disks under perturbations from\nmassive distant bodies and demonstrate that the resulting gravitational torques\nact to misalign the orbital planes of the disks relative to the spin poles of\ntheir host stars. As a result, we predict that in the absence of strong\ndisk-host star angular momentum coupling or sufficient dissipation that acts to\nrealign the stellar spin axis and the planetary orbits, the fraction of\nplanetary systems (including systems of hot Neptunes and Super-Earths), whose\nangular momentum vectors are misaligned with respect to their host-stars should\nbe commensurate with the rate of primordial stellar multiplicity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Apr 2013 15:47:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-19"}

It is also shown that the aplication of Harada-Tsutsui technique\nto other models which are not anomalous but do not exhibit gauge invariance\nallows the identification of the gauge invariant formulation of the Proca\nmodel, also done by the referred authors, with the Stueckelberg model, leading\nto the interpretation of the gauge invariant map as a generalization of the\nStueckelberg mechanism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Apr 2013 06:22:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 29 May 2013 19:37:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-13"}
