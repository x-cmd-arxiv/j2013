This review summarizes the theoretical background on\nquantum-mechanical calculations of the sensitivity coefficients of such\ntransitions to tiny changes in alpha and mu for a number of molecules which are\nusually observed in Galactic and extragalactic sources, and discusses the\npossibility of testing the space- and time-invariance of fundamental constants\nthrough comparison between precise laboratory measurements of the molecular\nrest frequencies and their astronomical counterparts.

The power of new sequencing methods now makes it possible to\nreinvigorate Medaka genetics, in particular by establishing a near-isogenic\npanel derived from a single wild population. Results Here we characterise the\ngenomes of wild Medaka catches obtained from a single Southern Japanese\npopulation in Kiyosu as a precursor for the establishment of a near isogenic\npanel of wild lines. The population is free of significant detrimental\npopulation structure, and has advantageous linkage disequilibrium properties\nsuitable for establishment of the proposed panel. Analysis of morphometric\ntraits in five representative inbred strains suggests phenotypic mapping will\nbe feasible in the panel. In addition high throughput genome sequencing of\nthese Medaka strains confirms their evolutionary relationships on lines of\ngeographic separation and provides further evidence that there has been little\nsignificant interbreeding between the Southern and Northern Medaka population\nsince the Southern/Northern population split.

The flare exhibits two ribbons in UV 1600\n{\\AA} emission. Analysis shows that the UV light curve at each flaring pixel\nrises impulsively within a few minutes, and decays slowly with a timescale >10\nmin. Since the lower atmosphere (transition region and chromosphere) responds\nto energy deposit nearly instantaneously, the rapid UV brightening is thought\nto reflect the energy release process in the newly formed flare loop rooted at\nthe footpoint. We utilize spatially resolved (down to 1 arcsec) UV light curves\nand thick-target hard X-ray emission to construct heating functions of a few\nthousand flare loops anchored at UV foot points, and compute plasma evolution\nin these loops using the EBTEL model. The modeled coronal temperatures and\ndensities of these flare loops are used to calculate synthetic soft X-ray\nspectra and light curves, which compare favorably with those observed by RHESSI\nand GOES/XRS. The time-dependent transition region DEM for each loop during its\ndecay phase is also computed with a simplified model and used to calculate the\noptically-thin C IV line emission, which dominates the UV 1600 {\\AA} bandpass\nduring the flare. The computed C IV line emission decays at the same rate as\nobserved. This study presents a method to constrain heating of\nreconnection-formed flare loops using all available observables independently,\nand provides insight into the physics of energy release and plasma heating\nduring the flare. With this method, the lower limit of the total energy used to\nheat the flare loops in this event is estimated to be 1.22e31 ergs, of which\nonly 1.9e30 ergs is carried by beam-driven upflows during the impulsive phase,\nsuggesting that the coronal plasmas are predominantly heated in situ.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Apr 2013 17:07:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 Apr 2013 16:57:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-25"}

For the purpose of examining the\nmicroscopic loss mechanisms in dielectrics, precise measurements of the\ninternal quality factor at different values of energy stored in the resonators\nare required. Here, we present a consistent method to analyze a LC\nsuperconducting resonator coupled to a transmission line. We first derive an\napproximate expression for the transmission S-parameter $S_{21}$ based on a\ncomplete circuit model. In the weak coupling limit, we show that the internal\nquality factor is reliably determined by fitting the approximate form of\n$S_{21}$. Since the voltage $V$ of the capacitor of the LC circuit is required\nto determine the energy stored in the resonator, we next calculate the relation\nbetween $V$ and the forward propagating wave voltage $V_{in}^+$. Due to the\ndependence of the quality factor on voltage, $V$ is not simply proportional to\n$V_{in}^+$. We find a self-consistent way to determine the relation between $V$\nand $V_{in}^+$, which employs only the fitting parameters for $S_{21}$ and a\nlinear scaling factor. We then examine the resonator transmission in the cases\nof port reflection and impedance mismatch. We find that resonator transmission\nasymmetry is primarily due to the reflection from discontinuity in transmission\nlines. We show that our analysis method to extract the internal quality factor\nis robust in the non-ideal cases above. Finally, we show that the analysis\nmethod on LC resonator can be generalize to arbitrary weakly coupled lumped and\ndistributed resonators. The generalization uses a systematic approximation on\nthe response function based on the pole and zero which are the closest to the\nresonance frequency. This Closest Pole and Zero Method (CPZM) is a valuable\ntool for analyzing physical measurements of high-Q resonators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Apr 2013 17:45:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Aug 2013 15:56:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-09"}

However, current methods of\ntexture analysis can not adequately describe such heterogeneous patterns.\nCommon methods used by researchers analyse the image information in a global\nway, taking all its features in an integrated manner. Furthermore, multi-scale\nanalysis verifies the patterns at different scales, but still preserving the\nhomogeneous analysis. On the other hand various methods use textons to\nrepresent the texture, breaking texture down into its smallest unit. To tackle\nthis problem, we propose a method to identify texture patterns not small as\ntextons at distinct scales enhancing the separability among different types of\ntexture. We find sub patterns of texture according to the scale and then group\nsimilar patterns for a more refined analysis. Tests were performed in four\nstatic texture databases and one dynamic one. Results show that our method\nprovides better classification rate compared with conventional approaches both\nin static and in dynamic texture.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Apr 2013 17:53:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-17"}

Although by now there is a good understanding of the structure of\ngraphs based on their edge connectivity, our knowledge in the case of vertex\nconnectivity is much more limited. An essential tool in capturing edge\nconnectivity are edge-disjoint spanning trees. The famous results of Tutte and\nNash-Williams show that a graph with edge connectivity $\\lambda$ contains\n$\\floor{\\lambda/2}$ edge-disjoint spanning trees.\n  We present connected dominating set (CDS) partition and packing as tools that\nare analogous to edge-disjoint spanning trees and that help us to better grasp\nthe structure of graphs based on their vertex connectivity. The objective of\nthe CDS partition problem is to partition the nodes of a graph into as many\nconnected dominating sets as possible. The CDS packing problem is the\ncorresponding fractional relaxation, where CDSs are allowed to overlap as long\nas this is compensated by assigning appropriate weights. CDS partition and CDS\npacking can be viewed as the counterparts of the well-studied edge-disjoint\nspanning trees, focusing on vertex disjointedness rather than edge\ndisjointness.\n  We constructively show that every $k$-vertex-connected graph with $n$ nodes\nhas a CDS packing of size $\\Omega(k/\\log n)$ and a CDS partition of size\n$\\Omega(k/\\log^5 n)$. We prove that the $\\Omega(k/\\log n)$ CDS packing bound is\nexistentially optimal.\n  Using CDS packing, we show that if vertices of a $k$-vertex-connected graph\nare independently sampled with probability $p$, then the graph induced by the\nsampled vertices has vertex connectivity $\\tilde{\\Omega}(kp^2)$. Moreover,\nusing our $\\Omega(k/\\log n)$ CDS packing, we get a store-and-forward broadcast\nalgorithm with optimal throughput in the networking model where in each round,\neach node can send one bounded-size message to all its neighbors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Apr 2013 19:00:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-17"}

Relying on a result of simultaneous Diophantine\napproximation, a real interference alignment scheme with joint receive antenna\nprocessing is developed. The scheme is used to obtain an achievable DoF region.\nThe proposed DoF region includes two previously known results as special cases,\nnamely 1) the total DoF of a $K$-user interference channel with $N$ antennas at\neach node, $(K, [N], [N])$ channel, is $NK/2$; and 2) the total DoF of a $(K,\n[M], [N])$ channel is at least $KMN/(M+N)$. We next explore\nconstant-coefficient interference networks with $K$ transmitters and $J$\nreceivers, all having $N$ antennas. Each transmitter emits an independent\nmessage and each receiver requests an arbitrary subset of the messages.\nEmploying the novel joint receive antenna processing, the DoF region for this\nset-up is obtained. We finally consider wireless X networks where each node is\nallowed to have an arbitrary number of antennas. It is shown that the joint\nreceive antenna processing can be used to establish an achievable DoF region,\nwhich is larger than what is possible with antenna splitting. As a special case\nof the derived achievable DoF region for constant coefficient X network, the\ntotal DoF of wireless X networks with the same number of antennas at all nodes\nand with joint antenna processing is tight while the best inner bound based on\nantenna splitting cannot meet the outer bound.

Scenarios in which the Higgs is a\npseudo Nambu-Goldstone boson (NGB) of some new strong dynamics must possess a\nnumber of non-generic features in order to pass the progressively stringent\ncollider bounds and simultaneously meet our naturalness criteria. Among these\nfeatures are the existence of light fermionic partners of the top quark and an\nefficient collective breaking of the Nambu-Goldstone symmetry. The top partners\nhave to be not only parametrically lighter than the other composites, but also\nweakly coupled to them in order to suppress unwanted flavor-violating effects.\nA Natural pseudo-NGB Higgs model should also be able to fit the LHC Higgs data\nwithout fine-tuning. Among theories with comparable compositeness scales, those\nthat predict smaller corrections in the Higgs couplings to the standard model\nparticles are therefore preferred.\n  A concrete implementation of these ingredients is discussed in a scenario\nbased on the coset SU(5)/SO(5).

An\nimportant role is played by an independent quartic Higgs coupling generated by\nUV-sensitive loops involving electroweak doublets mixing with the top partners.\nThe collider signature of this framework is shown to be rather model-dependent;\nin particular, the exotic scalars can alter the phenomenology of the top\npartners at a qualitative level.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Apr 2013 19:54:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 25 May 2013 15:00:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-28"}

Such events, ~10,000 times more energetic than\ntypical SNe today, would be among the biggest explosions in the history of the\nuniverse. Here we present a simulation of such a SN in two stages.

Encryption ensures that\nthe storage server obtains no information about the database, while PRAM and\nsampling ensures individual privacy is maintained against the authorized party.\nWe characterize how much the composition of random sampling with PRAM increases\nthe differential privacy of system compared to using PRAM alone. We also\nanalyze the statistical utility of our system, by bounding the estimation error\n- the expected l2-norm error between the true empirical distribution and the\nestimated distribution - as a function of the number of samples, PRAM noise,\nand other system parameters. Our analysis shows a tradeoff between increasing\nPRAM noise versus decreasing the number of samples to maintain a desired level\nof privacy, and we determine the optimal number of samples that balances this\ntradeoff and maximizes the utility. In experimental simulations with the UCI\n\"Adult Data Set\" and with synthetically generated data, we confirm that the\ntheoretically predicted optimal number of samples indeed achieves close to the\nminimal empirical error, and that our analytical error bounds match well with\nthe empirical results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Apr 2013 20:28:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-18"}

This brightest cluster\ngalaxy is the most distant cD galaxy confirmed to date. Ultra-deep HST/WFC3\nimages reveal an extended envelope starting from ~10 kpc and reaching ~70 kpc\nin radius along the semi-major axis. The spectral energy distributions indicate\nthat both its inner component and outer envelope are composed of an old,\npassively-evolving stellar population. The cD galaxy lies on the same mass-size\nrelation as the bulk of quiescent galaxies at similar redshifts. The cD galaxy\nhas a higher stellar mass surface density but a similar velocity dispersion to\nthose of more-massive, nearby cDs. If the cD galaxy is one of the progenitors\nof today's more massive cDs, its size and stellar mass have had to increase on\naverage by factors of $3.4\\pm1.1$ and $3.3\\pm1.3$ over the past ~8 Gyrs,\nrespectively.

Light curves for\nemission lines including H-beta and Fe II were measured by applying a fitting\nroutine to decompose the spectra into several continuum and emission-line\ncomponents, and we use cross-correlation techniques to determine the\nreverberation lags of the emission lines relative to V-band light curves.

We re-analyze the Halpha line profiles\nbefore 2009 (down to 2005) in order to investigate the variability of the the\ndisk structure in the innermost region, which seems to have detached from the\nBe star surface by 2008. A redshifted enhanced component is remarkable in all\nemission lines observed around the 2009 giant outburst, occasionally forming a\ntriple peak. These features indicate that the Be disk was warped in X-ray\nactive phase. We estimate the position of the warped region from fitting the\nradial velocity of the redshifted enhanced component of Halpha, and find that\nit was very close to the periastron when two giant outbursts in 2009 and 2011\nand a bright normal outburst in 2010 March occurred. These facts strongly\nsuggest that the warped Be disk triggered these giant outbursts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Apr 2013 00:09:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

Subtle systematic errors in image\nreduction can compromise the power of this technique. We use the B-mode signal\nto quantify this systematic error and to test methods for reducing this error.\nWe show that two procedures are efficient in suppressing systematic error in\nthe B-mode: (1) refinement of the mosaic CCD warping procedure to conform to\nabsolute celestial coordinates and (2) truncation of the smoothing procedure on\na scale of 10$^{\\prime}$. Application of these procedures reduces the\nsystematic error to 20% of its original amplitude. We provide an analytic\nexpression for the distribution of the highest peaks in noise maps that can be\nused to estimate the fraction of false peaks in the weak lensing $\\kappa$-S/N\nmaps as a function of the detection threshold.

Taking into account resistive scattering by Coulomb disorder\narising from quenched random charged impurities in the environment, we show\nthat the 2D conductivity \\sigma(n) varies as \\sigma ~ n^{\\beta(n)} as a\nfunction of the 2D carrier density n where the exponent \\beta(n) is a smooth,\nbut non-monotonic, function of density with possible nontrivial extrema. In\nparticular, the density scaling exponent \\beta(n) depends qualitatively on\nwhether the Coulomb disorder arises primarily from remote or background charged\nimpurities or short-range disorder, and can, in principle, be used to\ncharacterize the nature of the dominant background disorder. A specific\nimportant prediction of the theory is that for resistive scattering by remote\ncharged impurities, the exponent \\beta can reach a value as large as 2.7 for\nk_F d ~ 1, where k_F ~\\sqrt{n} is the 2D Fermi wave vector and d is the\nseparation of the remote impurities from the 2D layer.

This effect is more significant when the\ndensity at the outer boundary is higher. The properties of outflows such as\nvelocity, momentum and energy fluxes, and the ratio of outflow rate and the\naccretion rate, are calculated. We find that the efficiency of transferring the\nradiation power into the kinetic power of outflow is typically $10^{-3}$, far\nbelow the value of $\\sim 0.05$ which is assumed in some cosmological\nsimulations. The effect of the temperature of the gas at the outer boundary\n($T_0$) is investigated. When $T_0$ is high, the emitted luminosity of the\naccretion flow oscillates. This is because in this case the gas around the\nBondi radius can be more easily heated to be above the virial temperature due\nto its high internal energy. Another question we hope to address is the\nso-called \"sub-Eddington\" puzzle. Observationally, the luminosity of almost all\nAGNs are sub-Eddington, while theoretically the luminosity of an accretion flow\ncan easily be super-Eddington. We find that even when the re-radiation effect\nis included and outflow does become much stronger, the luminosity, while\nreduced, can still be super-Eddington.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Apr 2013 04:55:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 20 Jun 2013 13:29:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

This assumption can be fulfilled only in perfectly liquid\nmarkets. Since most markets are illquid, this assumption might be too\nrestrictive. Thus, taking into account the price impact in option pricing is an\nimportant issue. This issue has been dealt with, to some extent, for illiquid\nmarkets by assuming a continuous process, mainly based on the Brownian motion.\nHowever, the recent financial crisis and its effects on the global stock\nmarkets have propagated the urgent need for more realistic models where the\nstochastic process describing the price trajectories involves random jumps.\nNonetheless, works related to markets with jumps are scant compared to the\ncontinuous ones. In addition, these previous studies do not deal with illiquid\nmarkets. The contribution of this paper is to tackle the pricing problem for\noptions in illiquid markets with jumps as well as the hedging strategy within\nthis context, which is the first of its kind to the best knowledge.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Apr 2013 04:58:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-18"}

Voltage pulses arising from a BC501A organic liquid scintillation\ndetector in a mixed radiation field have been recorded with a fast digital\nsampling oscilloscope. The performances of most pulse shape discrimination\nmethods in scintillation detection systems using time-domain features of the\npulses are affected intensively by noise. However, the WTMM method using\nfrequency-domain features exhibits a strong insensitivity to noise and can be\nused to discriminate neutron and {\\gamma}-ray events based on their different\nasymptotic decay trend between the positive modulus maximum curve and the\nnegative modulus maximum curve in the scale-space plane. This technique has\nbeen verified by the corresponding mixed-field data assessed by the\ntime-of-flight (TOF) method and the frequency gradient analysis (FGA) method.\nIt is shown that the characterization of neutron and gamma achieved by the\ndiscrimination method based on WTMM is consistent with that afforded by TOF and\nbetter than FGA. Moreover, because the WTMM method is it self presented to\neliminate the noise, there is no need to make any pretreatment for the pulses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Apr 2013 08:25:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-18"}

This prediction is borne out\nby the cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of Crain et al., which reproduce\nscaling relations between the X-ray and optical properties of nearby disc\ngalaxies. Such coronae are metal poor, but observations of the X-ray emitting\ncircumgalactic medium (CGM) of local galaxies typically indicate enrichment to\nnear-solar iron abundance, potentially signalling a shortcoming in galaxy\nformation models. We show here that, while the hot CGM of galaxies formed in\nthe simulations is metal poor in a mass-weighted sense, its X-ray\nluminosity-weighted metallicity is often close to solar. This bias arises\nbecause the soft X-ray emissivity of a typical 0.1 keV corona is dominated by\ncollisionally-excited metal ions that are synthesised in stars and recycled\ninto the hot CGM. We find that these metals are ejected primarily by stars that\nform in-situ to the main progenitor of the galaxy, rather than in satellites or\nexternal galaxies. The enrichment of the hot CGM therefore proceeds in an\ninside-out fashion throughout the assembly of the galaxy: metals are\ntransported from the central galaxy by SNe-driven winds and convection over\nseveral gigayears, establishing a strong negative radial metallicity gradient.\nWhilst metal ions synthesised by stars are necessary to produce the X-ray\nemissivity that enables the hot CGM of isolated galaxies to be detected, the\nelectrons that collisionally excite them are equally important. Since our\nsimulations indicate that the electron density of hot coronae is dominated by\nthe metal-poor gas accreted from the IGM, we infer that the hot CGM observed\nvia X-ray emission is the outcome of both hierarchical accretion and stellar\nrecycling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Apr 2013 08:37:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

To overcome this\nchallenging situation, the design but also the evaluation of alternative\ndynamic routing models and their comparison with BGP shall be performed by\nmeans of simulation.

However, acetone\n(CH3)2CO, a special complex O-bearing molecule, has been shown to have a very\ndifferent distribution from other typical O-bearing molecules in the BN/KL\nregion. We searched for acetone within our IRAM Plateau de Bure Interferometer\n3 mm and 1.3 mm data sets. Twenty-two acetone lines were searched within these\ndata sets. The angular resolution ranged from 1.8 X 0.8 to 6.0 X 2.3 arcsec^2,\nand the spectral resolution ranged from 0.4 to 1.9 km s-1. Nine of the acetone\nlines appear free of contamination. Three main acetone peaks (Ace-1, 2, and 3)\nare identified in Orion BN/KL. The new acetone source Ace-3 and the extended\nemission in the north of the hot core region have been found for the first\ntime. An excitation temperature of about 150 K is determined toward Ace-1 and\nAce-2, and the acetone column density is estimated to be 2-4 X 10^16 cm-2 with\na relative abundance of 1-6 X 10^-8 toward these two peaks. Acetone is a few\ntimes less abundant toward the hot core and Ace-3 compared with Ace-1 and\nAce-2.\n  We find that the overall distribution of acetone in BN/KL is similar to that\nof N-bearing molecules, e.g., NH3 and C2H5CN, and very different from those of\nlarge O-bearing molecules, e.g., HCOOCH3 and (CH3)2O. Our findings show the\nacetone distribution is more extended than in previous studies and does not\noriginate only in those areas where both N-bearing and O-bearing species are\npresent. Moreover, because the N-bearing molecules may be associated with\nshocked gas in Orion BN/KL, this suggests that the formation and/or destruction\nof acetone may involve ammonia or large N-bearing molecules in a shocked-gas\nenvironment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Apr 2013 12:37:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

However, no known work is capable to release this kind of aggregation\nwhen the query contains unrestricted join operations. This severely limits the\napplications of existing differential privacy techniques because many data\nanalysis tasks require unrestricted joins. One example is subgraph counting on\na graph. Existing methods for differentially private subgraph counting address\nonly edge differential privacy and are subject to very simple subgraphs. Before\nthis work, whether any nontrivial graph statistics can be released with\nreasonable accuracy under node differential privacy is still an open problem.\n  In this paper, we propose a novel differentially private mechanism to release\nan approximation to a linear statistic of the result of some positive\nrelational algebra calculation over a sensitive database.

The method achieves high order of accuracy in space together with\nessentially non-oscillatory behavior using a nonlinear WENO reconstruction\noperator on unstructured triangular meshes. High order accuracy in time is\nobtained via a local Lagrangian space-time Galerkin predictor method that\nevolves the spatial reconstruction polynomials in time within each element. The\nfinal one-step finite volume scheme is derived by integration over a moving\nspace-time control volume, where the non-conservative products are treated by a\npath-conservative approach that defines the jump terms on the element\nboundaries. The entire method is formulated as an Arbitrary-Lagrangian-Eulerian\n(ALE) method, where the mesh velocity can be chosen independently of the fluid\nvelocity.\n  The new scheme is applied to the full seven-equation Baer-Nunziato model of\ncompressible multi-phase flows in two space dimensions. The use of a Lagrangian\napproach allows an excellent resolution of the solid contact and the resolution\nof jumps in the volume fraction. The high order of accuracy of the scheme in\nspace and time is confirmed via a numerical convergence study. Finally, the\nproposed method is also applied to a reduced version of the compressible\nBaer-Nunziato model for the simulation of free surface water waves in moving\ndomains. In particular, the phenomenon of sloshing is studied in a moving water\ntank and comparisons with experimental data are provided.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Apr 2013 13:27:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-18"}

Previously, it was demonstrated that when\n$u$ is less than the critical value $u_{c1}$, which does not depend on $L$, the\nphase slip centers appear simultaneously at different spots of the channel.\nHerewith, for $u>u_{c1}$ these centres arise consecutively at the same place.\nIn our work we demonstrate that there is another critical value for $u$.\nActually, if $u$ does not exceed a certain value $u_{c2}$, which depends on\n$L$, the current-voltage characteristic exhibits the step-like behaviour.\nHowever, for $u>u_{c2}$ it becomes hysteretic.

The background geomagnetic field is taken for the dayside of the\nmagnetosphere, where the magnetic field have magnetic \"holes\" (Antonova and\nShabansky 1968). The balance equation is solved numerically to obtain the\nnonlinear density distribution of ions (H$^{+}$) in the presence of heavy ions\n(He$^{+}$). It is shown that for frequencies less than the helium gyrofrequency\nat the equator the nonlinear plasma density perturbations are peaked in the\nvicinity of the equator due to the action of the ponderomotive force. A\ncomparison of the cases of the dipole and dayside magnetosphere is provided.

Several recursion formulae have been proposed during\nthe last decades, whose derivations mostly contain heuristic parts and\ntherefore remain mathematically questionable. We propose a more justifiable\napproach, including an alternative recursion formula for the expected LD. Since\nthe exact formula depends on the distribution of allele frequencies in a very\ncomplicated manner, we suggest an approximate solution and analyze its validity\nextensively in a simulation study. Compared to the widely used formula of Sved,\nthe proposed formula performs better for all parameter constellations\nconsidered. We then analyze the expected LD at equilibrium using the theory on\ndiscrete-time Markov chains based on the linear recursion formula, with\nequilibrium being defined as the steady-state of the chain, which finally leads\nto a formula for the effective population size N_e. An additional analysis\nconsiders the effect of non-exactness of a recursion formula on the\nsteady-state, demonstrating that the resulting error in expected LD can be\nsubstantial. In an application to the HapMap data of two human populations we\nillustrate the dependency of the N_e-estimate on the distribution of minor\nallele frequencies (MAFs), showing that the estimated N_e can vary by up to 30%\nwhen a uniform instead of a skewed distribution of MAFs is taken as a basis to\nselect SNPs for the analyses.

In SBRT the dose is delivered using\nopen fields (e.g., beam's-eye-view) known as \"apertures\". Mathematical methods\ncan be used for optimizing treatment planning for delivery of sufficient dose\nto the cancerous cells while keeping the dose to surrounding organs at risk\n(OARs) minimal. Two important elements of a treatment plan are quality and\ndelivery time. Quality of a plan is measured based on the target coverage and\ndose to OARs. Delivery time heavily depends on the number of beams used in the\nplan since the setup times for different beam directions constitute a large\nportion of the delivery time. Therefore the ideal plan, in which all potential\nbeams can be used simultaneously, will be associated with a long impractical\ndelivery time. We use the dose to OARs in the ideal plan to find the plan with\nthe minimum number of beams which is guaranteed to be epsilon-optimal (i.e., a\npredetermined maximum deviation from the ideal plan is guaranteed). Since the\ntreatment plan optimization is inherently a multicriteria optimization problem,\nthe planner can navigate the ideal dose distribution Pareto surface and select\na plan of desired target coverage versus OARs sparing, and then use the\nproposed technique to reduce the number of beams while guaranteeing\nepsilon-optimality. We use mixed integer programming (MIP) for optimization. To\nreduce the computation time for the resultant MIP, we use two heuristics: a\nbeam elimination scheme and a family of heuristic cuts, known as \"neighbor\ncuts\", based on the concept of \"adjacent beams\". We show the effectiveness of\nthe proposed solution technique on two clinical cases, a liver and a lung case.\nBased on our technique we propose an algorithm for fast generation of\nepsilon-optimal plans.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Apr 2013 15:38:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

This theme\ngives examples of weakly representable atom structures that are not strongly\nrepresentable. Many constructions existing in the literature are placed in a\nrigorous way in such a framework, properly defined.\n  This is the essence too of construction of Monk like-algebras, one constructs\ngraphs with finite colouring (finitely many blurs), converging to one with\ninfinitely many, so that the original algebra is also blurred at the complex\nalgebra level, and the term algebra is completey representable, yielding a\nrepresentation of its completion the complex algebra.\n  A reverse of this process exists in the literature, it builds algebras with\ninfinite blurs converging to one with finite blurs.

First, we show that the\nmetric for zero cosmological constant and the Power-Maxwell Lagrangian of the\nform of $\\sqrt{\\left\\vert F_{\\mu \\nu }F^{\\mu \\nu }\\right\\vert }$, coincides\nwith the solution given in $2+1-$% dimensional gravity coupled with a massless,\nself interacting real scalar field. With the same Lagrangian and a non-zero\ncosmological constant we obtain a non-asymptotically flat wormhole solution in\n$2+1-$dimensions. The confining motions of massive charged and chargeless\nparticles are investigated too. Secondly, another interesting solution is given\nfor zero cosmological constant together with conformal invariant condition. The\nformation of timelike naked singularity for this particular case is\ninvestigated within the framework of the quantum mechanics. Quantum fields\nobeying the Klein-Gordon and Dirac equations are used to probe the singularity\nand test the quantum mechanical status of the singularity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Apr 2013 10:36:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Dec 2013 17:42:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-31"}
