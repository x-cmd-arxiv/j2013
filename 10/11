The aim of this work is to investigate the spectral index distribution\nof the radio halo in the galaxy cluster A520, a complex system from an optical,\nradio, and X-ray point of view. We present deep Very Large Array observations\nin total intensity at 325 and 1400 MHz.

This is particularly true for\nground-based interferometric detectors, like LIGO, space-based detectors, like\nLISA and its derivatives, spacecraft doppler tracking detectors, and pulsar\ntiming arrays detectors. The description of gravitational waves, and a\ngravitational wave detector's response, to the unphysical metric perturbation\nhas lead to a proliferation of false analogies and descriptions regarding how\nthese detectors function, and true misunderstandings of the physical character\nof gravitational waves.\n  Here we provide a fully physical and gauge invariant description of the\nresponse of a wide class of gravitational wave detectors in terms of the\nRiemann curvature, the physical quantity that describes gravitational phenomena\nin general relativity. In the limit of high frequency gravitational waves, the\nRiemann curvature separates into two independent gauge invariant quantities: a\n\"background\" curvature contribution and a \"wave\" curvature contribution. In\nthis limit the gravitational wave contribution to the detector response reduces\nto an integral of the gravitational wave contribution of the curvature along\nthe unperturbed photon path between components of the detector. The description\npresented here provides an unambiguous physical description of what a\ngravitational wave detector measures and how it operates, a simple means of\ncomputing corrections to a detectors response owing to general detector motion,\na straightforward way of connecting the results of numerical relativity\nsimulations to gravitational wave detection, and a basis for a general and\nfully relativistic pulsar timing formula.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Oct 2013 16:19:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-25"}

However, current algorithms only consider\n\"normal\" evacuees and do not meet the specific requirements of diverse\nevacuees. Our algorithms make use of the flexibility of CPN which can operate\nwith different user-defined goals to customize appropriate paths for each\ncategory. The CPN algorithm is simulated in a graph based discrete-event\nsimulator and Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm is taken as reference. The\nresults show that the CPN algorithm reaches the performance of ideal\npath-finding algorithm and quality of service is improved by using specific\ngoal functions for diverse categories of evacuees. Finally, we present a future\nplan for further research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Oct 2013 17:04:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-11"}

The ratio $R^{c/n}$ of the yield of pairs of charged mesons\nto that of neutral mesons near the threshold for the heavy pair is strongly\naffected by the isospin breaking due to the isotopic mass differences and due\nto the Coulomb interaction between the charged mesons.

In 1914 Einstein wrote\nthe equations for conservation of energy-momentum for matter, and established a\nconnection between these equations and the components of the gravitational\nfield. He showed that a material point in gravitational fields moves on a\ngeodesic line in space-time, the equation of which is written in terms of the\nChristoffel symbols. By November 4, 1915, Einstein found it advantageous to use\nfor the components of the gravitational field, not the previous equation, but\nthe Christoffel symbols.

We find that the likelihood of a galaxy\nhosting a bar is anti-correlated with SSFR, regardless of stellar mass or bulge\nprominence. We find that the trends of bar likelihood and bar length with bulge\nprominence are bimodal with SSFR. We interpret these observations using\nstate-of-the-art simulations of bar evolution which include live halos and the\neffects of gas and star formation. We suggest our observed trends of bar\nlikelihood with SSFR are driven by the gas fraction of the disks; a factor\ndemonstrated to significantly retard both bar formation and evolution in\nmodels. We interpret the bimodal relationship between bulge prominence and bar\nproperties as due to the complicated effects of classical bulges and central\nmass concentrations on bar evolution, and also to the growth of disky\npseudobulges by bar evolution. These results represent empirical evidence for\nsecular evolution driven by bars in disk galaxies. This work suggests that bars\nare not stagnant structures within disk galaxies, but are a critical\nevolutionary driver of their host galaxies in the local universe ($z<1$).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Oct 2013 20:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Nov 2013 22:39:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

The gas accretion must have been at low\nmetallicity in order to reconcile the metallicities observed in the disc with\nthe predictions of chemical evolution models. But how does this gas accretion\ntake place? I review the current evidence of gas accretion into the Milky Way\nand similar galaxies through the infall of cold gas clouds and satellites. The\nconclusion from these studies is that the infalling gas at high column\ndensities observed in HI emission is a least one order of magnitude below the\nvalue required to sustain star formation, thus accretion must come from a\ndifferent channel. The likely reservoir for gas accretion is the cosmological\ncorona of virial-temperature gas in which every galaxy must be embedded. At the\ninterface between the disc and the corona the cold high-metallicity disc gas\nand the hot coronal medium must mix efficiently and this mix- ing causes the\ncooling and accretion of the lower corona. I show how this mechanism reproduces\nthe kinematics of the neutral extraplanar gas in the Milky Way and other nearby\ngalaxies and the ionised high-velocity clouds observed in HST spectra. I\nconclude with the speculation that the loss in efficiency of the disc-corona\ninteraction is the ultimate cause for the evolution of disc galaxies towards\nthe red sequence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Oct 2013 20:26:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

These methods classify initially\nunlabeled nodes by propagating label information over the structure of graph\nstarting from seed nodes. Graph-based SSL algorithms usually scale linearly\nwith the number of distinct labels (m), and require O(m) space on each node.\nUnfortunately, there exist many applications of practical significance with\nvery large m over large graphs, demanding better space and time complexity. In\nthis paper, we propose MAD-SKETCH, a novel graph-based SSL algorithm which\ncompactly stores label distribution on each node using Count-min Sketch, a\nrandomized data structure. We present theoretical analysis showing that under\nmild conditions, MAD-SKETCH can reduce space complexity at each node from O(m)\nto O(log m), and achieve similar savings in time complexity as well. We support\nour analysis through experiments on multiple real world datasets. We observe\nthat MAD-SKETCH achieves similar performance as existing state-of-the-art\ngraph- based SSL algorithms, while requiring smaller memory footprint and at\nthe same time achieving up to 10x speedup. We find that MAD-SKETCH is able to\nscale to datasets with one million labels, which is beyond the scope of\nexisting graph- based SSL algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Oct 2013 20:30:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 Feb 2014 21:19:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-03"}

Sharing taxi trips is a possible way of reducing the\nnegative impact of taxi services on cities, but this comes at the expense of\npassenger discomfort quantifiable in terms of a longer travel time. Due to\ncomputational challenges, taxi sharing has traditionally been approached on\nsmall scales, such as within airport perimeters, or with dynamical ad-hoc\nheuristics. However, a mathematical framework for the systematic understanding\nof the tradeoff between collective benefits of sharing and individual passenger\ndiscomfort is lacking. Here we introduce the notion of shareability network\nwhich allows us to model the collective benefits of sharing as a function of\npassenger inconvenience, and to efficiently compute optimal sharing strategies\non massive datasets. We apply this framework to a dataset of millions of taxi\ntrips taken in New York City, showing that with increasing but still relatively\nlow passenger discomfort, cumulative trip length can be cut by 40% or more.\nThis benefit comes with reductions in service cost, emissions, and with split\nfares, hinting towards a wide passenger acceptance of such a shared service.\nSimulation of a realistic online system demonstrates the feasibility of a\nshareable taxi service in New York City. Shareability as a function of trip\ndensity saturates fast, suggesting effectiveness of the taxi sharing system\nalso in cities with much sparser taxi fleets or when willingness to share is\nlow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Oct 2013 20:56:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Sep 2014 19:48:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-17"}

Because\nmolecular sequence data are not informative on absolute time, external data,\nmost commonly fossil age estimates, are required to calibrate estimates of\nspecies divergence dates. For Bayesian divergence-time methods, the common\npractice for calibration using fossil information involves placing arbitrarily\nchosen parametric distributions on internal nodes, often disregarding most of\nthe information in the fossil record. We introduce the 'fossilized birth-death'\n(FBD) process, a model for calibrating divergence-time estimates in a Bayesian\nframework, explicitly acknowledging that extant species and fossils are part of\nthe same macroevolutionary process. Under this model, absolute node age\nestimates are calibrated by a single diversification model and arbitrary\ncalibration densities are not necessary. Moreover, the FBD model allows for\ninclusion of all available fossils. We performed analyses of simulated data and\nshow that node-age estimation under the FBD model results in robust and\naccurate estimates of species divergence times with realistic measures of\nstatistical uncertainty, overcoming major limitations of standard divergence\ntime estimation methods. We then used this model to estimate the speciation\ntimes for a dataset composed of all living bears, indicating that the genus\nUrsus diversified in the late Miocene to mid Pliocene.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Oct 2013 22:04:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 Oct 2013 20:48:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-11"}

Here we report on a high-resolution global forecast of earthquake\nrate density as a function of location, magnitude, and focal mechanism. In\nprevious publications we reported forecasts of 0.5 degree spatial resolution,\ncovering the latitude range magnitude, and focal mechanism. In previous\npublications we reported forecasts of 0.5 degree spatial resolution, covering\nthe latitude range from -75 to +75 degrees, based on the Global Central Moment\nTensor earthquake catalog. In the new forecasts we've improved the spatial\nresolution to 0.1 degree and the latitude range from pole to pole. Our focal\nmechanism estimates require distance-weighted combinations of observed focal\nmechanisms within 1000 km of each grid point. Simultaneously we calculate an\naverage rotation angle between the forecasted mechanism and all the surrounding\nmechanisms, using the method of Kagan & Jackson proposed in 1994. This average\nangle reveals the level of tectonic complexity of a region and indicates the\naccuracy of the prediction. The procedure becomes problematical where longitude\nlines are not approximately parallel, and where earthquakes are so sparse that\nan adequate sample spans very large distances. North or south of 75 degrees,\nthe azimuths of points 1000 km away may vary by about 35 degrees. We solved\nthis problem by calculating focal mechanisms on a plane tangent to the earth's\nsurface at each forecast point, correcting for the rotation of the longitude\nlines at the locations of earthquakes included in the averaging. The\ncorrections are negligible between -30 and +30 degrees latitude, but outside\nthat band uncorrected rotations can be significantly off.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Oct 2013 22:33:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

In\nsharp contrast, particles organized into a perfect hexagonal crystal in the\nplane cannot accommodate an interstitial by a simple re-adjustment of the\nparticle spacing - the interstitial remains instead trapped between lattice\nsites and diffuses by hopping, leaving the crystal permanently defected. Here\nwe report on the behavior of interstitials in colloidal crystals on curved\nsurfaces.

A unified\nfamily of classification machines, the FLexible Assortment MachinE (FLAME) is\nproposed, within which DWD and SVM are special cases. The FLAME family helps to\nidentify the similarities and differences between SVM and DWD.

We restrict our\nanalysis to the case of thin-walled cosmic strings which occur when large\nmagnetic flux trapped inside the string. Thus the string looks like a tube of\nfixed radius, at which it is classically stable. The core of the string\ncontains magnetic flux in the true vacuum, while outside the string, separated\nby a thin wall, is the false vacuum. The string decays by tunnelling to a\nconfiguration which is represented by a bulge, where the region of true vacuum\nwithin, is ostensibly enlarged. The bulge can be described as the meeting, of a\nkink soliton anti-soliton pair, along the length of the string. It can be\ndescribed as a bulge appearing in the initial string, starting from the string\nof small, classically stable radius, expanding to a fat string of large,\nclassically unstable (to expansion) radius and then returning back to the\nstring of small radius along its length. This configuration is the bounce point\nof a corresponding O(2) symmetric instanton, which we can determine\nnumerically. Once the bulge appears it explodes in real time. The kink soliton\nanti-soliton pair recede from each other along the length of the string with a\nvelocity that quickly approaches the speed of light, leaving behind a fat tube.\nAt the same time the radius of the fat tube that is being formed, expands\n(transversely) as it is no longer classically stable, converting false vacuum\nto the true vacuum with ever diluting magnetic field within. The rate of this\nexpansion is determined by the energy difference between the true vacuum and\nthe false vacuum.

According to the Li-Paczynski kilonova\nmodel, the merger would launch sub-relativistic ejecta and a\nnear-infrared/optical transient would then occur, lasting up to days, which is\npowered by the radioactive decay of heavy elements synthesized in the ejecta.\nThe detection of a late bump using the {\\em Hubble Space Telescope} ({\\em HST})\nin the near-infrared afterglow light curve of the short-hard GRB 130603B is\nindeed consistent with such a model. However, as shown in this Letter, the\nlimited {\\em HST} near-infrared lightcurve behavior can also be interpreted as\nthe synchrotron radiation of the external shock driven by a wide mildly\nrelativistic outflow. In such a scenario, the radio emission is expected to\npeak with a flux of $\\sim 100 \\mu$Jy, which is detectable for current radio\narrays. Hence, the radio afterglow data can provide complementary evidence on\nthe nature of the bump in GRB 130603B.

Teaching in such a way as to discourage\ncreative answers and approaches may lead to higher scores on standardized tests\n(with all the sociological, marketplace, and political consequences that\nentails). Teachers claim to value creativity, but to hold negative attitudes\ntoward, and show little tolerance of, attributes associated with creativity,\nsuch as risk taking, impulsivity, and independence. When teachers do encourage\ncreativity, it is often the case that neither teacher nor students knows what\nthe expectations are.

Thus, increasing this time is a key goal in the\nfield. Dynamical decoupling has proven to be efficient in prolonging the\ncoherence times for the benefit of quantum sensing. However, dynamical\ndecoupling can only push the sensitivity up to a certain limit. In this work we\npresent a new approach to increasing the coherence time further through error\ncorrection which can improve the efficiency of quantum sensing beyond the\nfundamental limits of current state of the art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Oct 2013 03:39:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

In this work we perform a test to\nwhat is possibly the most widely accepted excitation theory for this class of\nstellar pulsators. The test is based on the study of a subset of members of\nthis class for which stringent data on the fundamental parameters are available\nthanks to interferometry. For three out of the four stars considered in this\nstudy, we find that linear, non-adiabatic models with envelope convection\nsuppressed around the magnetic poles can reproduce well the frequency region\nwhere oscillations are observed. For the fourth star in our sample no agreement\nis found, indicating that a new excitation mechanism must be considered. For\nthe three stars whose observed frequencies can be explained by the excitation\nmodels under discussion, we derive the minimum angular extent of the region\nwhere convection must be suppressed. Finally, we find that the frequency\nregions where modes are expected to be excited in these models is very\nsensitive to the stellar radius. This opens the interesting possibility of\ndetermining this quantity and related ones, such as the effective temperature\nor luminosity, from comparison between model predictions and observations, in\nother targets for which these parameters are not well determined.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Oct 2013 04:48:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

In particular, the present study aims to clarify the\nrespective contributions of the conditioning during the hot rolling and the\nvariant selection (VS) during the phase transformation to the inherited\ntexture. To this end, an alternative crystallographic reconstruction procedure,\nwhich can be directly applied to experimental electron backscatter diffraction\n(EBSD) mappings, is developed by combining the best features of the existing\nmodels: the orientation relationship (OR) refinement, the local pixel-by-pixel\nanalysis and the nuclei identification and spreading strategy. The\napplicability of this method is demonstrated on both quenching and partitioning\n(Q&P) and as-quenched lath-martensite steels. The results obtained on the C-Mn\nsteels confirm that the sample finish rolled at the lowest temperature\n(829{\\deg}C) exhibits the sharpest transformation texture. It is shown that\nthis sharp texture is exclusively due to a strong VS from parent brass\n{110}<1-12>, S {213}<-3-64> and Goss {110}<001> grains, whereas the VS from the\ncopper {112}<-1-11> grains is insensitive to the FRT. In addition, a\nstatistical VS analysis proves that the habit planes of the selected variants\ndo not systematically correspond to the predicted active slip planes using the\nTaylor model. In contrast, a correlation between the Bain group to which the\nselected variants belong and the FRT is clearly revealed, regardless of the\nparent orientation. These results are discussed in terms of polygranular\naccommodation mechanisms, especially in view of the observed development in the\nhot-rolled samples of high-angle grain boundaries with misorientation axes\nbetween <111> and <110> .\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Oct 2013 07:37:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

With the majority of the X-ray sources\nattributed to AGNs of low-to-moderate levels (L/L_Edd>~10^-4), we discuss the\ndetection rate in the context of the occupation of AGNs to halos of this mass\nscale and redshift, and compare the structural/morphological properties between\nAGN-active and non-active galaxies of different rank and location within the\ngroup halos. We see a slight tendency for AGN hosts to have either relatively\nbrighter/denser disks (or relatively fainter/diffuse bulges) than non-active\ngalaxies of similar mass. At galaxy mass scales <10^11 Msolar, central galaxies\nappear to be a factor ~4 more likely to host AGNs than satellite galaxies of\nsimilar mass. This effect, coupled with the tendency for AGNs to reside in\nmassive galaxies, explains the (weak) trend for AGNs to be preferentially found\nin the inner regions of groups, with no detectable trend with halo-centric\ndistance in the frequency of AGNs within the satellite population. Finally, our\ndata support other analyses in finding that the rate of decline with redshift\nof AGN activity in groups matches that of the global AGN population, indicating\nthat either AGNs occur preferentially in groups, or that the evolution rate is\nindependent of halo mass. These trends are of potential importance, and require\nX-ray coverage of a larger sample to be solidly confirmed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Oct 2013 08:32:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

Channel hardening refers\nto the phenomenon where the off-diagonal terms of the ${\\bf H}^H{\\bf H}$ matrix\nbecome increasingly weaker compared to the diagonal terms as the size of the\nchannel gain matrix ${\\bf H}$ increases. Specifically, we propose a message\npassing detection (MPD) algorithm which works with the real-valued matched\nfiltered received vector (whose signal term becomes ${\\bf H}^T{\\bf H}{\\bf x}$,\nwhere ${\\bf x}$ is the transmitted vector), and uses a Gaussian approximation\non the off-diagonal terms of the ${\\bf H}^T{\\bf H}$ matrix.

The proposed\nCHEMP receiver achieves very good performance in large-scale MIMO systems\n(e.g., in systems with 16 to 128 uplink users and 128 base station antennas).\nFor the considered large MIMO settings, the complexity of the proposed MPD\nalgorithm is almost the same as or less than that of the minimum mean square\nerror (MMSE) detection.

To achieve adequate reserve commitment and to promote market\nparticipation, it is necessary to provide models that can capture daily\npatterns in wind power production. This paper presents a cyclic inhomogeneous\nMarkov process, which is based on a three-dimensional state-space (wind power,\nspeed and direction). Each time-dependent transition probability is expressed\nas a Bernstein polynomial. The model parameters are estimated by solving a\nconstrained optimization problem: The objective function combines two maximum\nlikelihood estimators, one to ensure that the Markov process long-term behavior\nreproduces the data accurately and another to capture daily fluctuations. A\nconvex formulation for the overall optimization problem is presented and its\napplicability demonstrated through the analysis of a case-study. The proposed\nmodel is capable of reproducing the diurnal patterns of a three-year dataset\ncollected from a wind turbine located in a mountainous region in Portugal. In\naddition, it is shown how to compute persistence statistics directly from the\nMarkov process transition matrices. Based on the case-study, the power\nproduction persistence through the daily cycle is analysed and discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Oct 2013 10:13:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-14"}

Signatures of outflowing gas are found in up to 6\nOH doublets with different excitation requirements. At least two outflowing\ncomponents are identified, one with OH radiatively excited, and the other with\nlow excitation, presumably spatially extended. Particularly prominent, the blue\nwing of the absorption detected in the in-ladder 2Pi_{3/2} J=9/2-7/2 OH doublet\nat 65 um, with E_lower=290 K, indicates that the excited outflowing gas is\ngenerated in a compact and warm (circum)nuclear region. Because the excited,\noutflowing OH gas in Mrk 231 is associated with the warm, far-IR continuum\nsource, it is likely more compact (diameter of 200-300 pc) than that probed by\nCO and HCN.

We also\nprovide a general expression for the rank of a general class of mixing\nmatrices, which governs the number of independent colour factors arising from\nsuch webs. Finally, we use the poset language to examine a previously\nconjectured sum rule for the columns of web-mixing matrices which governs the\ncancellation of the leading subdivergences between diagrams in the web. Our\nresults, when combined with parallel developments in the evaluation of\nkinematic integrals, offer new insights into the all-order structure of\ninfrared singularities in non-Abelian gauge theories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Oct 2013 14:00:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

Many previous studies\nhave used a macroscopic force law, including a drag force which is quadratic in\nvelocity, to characterize the decelerating force on the intruder. However, the\nmicroscopic origins of the force law terms are still a subject of debate. Here,\ndrawing from previous experiments with photoelastic particles, we present a\nmodel which describes the velocity-squared force in terms of repeated\ncollisions with clusters of grains. From our high speed photoelastic data, we\ninfer that `clusters' correspond to segments of the strong force network that\nare excited by the advancing intruder. The model predicts a scaling relation\nfor the velocity-squared drag force that accounts for the intruder shape.\nAdditionally, we show that the collisional model predicts an instability to\nrotations, which depends on the intruder shape. To test this model, we perform\na comprehensive experimental study of the dynamics of two-dimensional granular\nimpacts on beds of photoelastic disks, with different profiles for the leading\nedge of the intruder. We particularly focus on a simple and useful case for\ntesting shape effects by using triangular-nosed intruders.

This walk contains O(\\sqrt{N}) steps, which represents a speedup\nover a classical search, which would require O(N) steps. The overall graph,\nstar plus G, is divided into two parts, and we find that for a quantum speedup\nto occur, the eigenvalues associated with these two parts in the N goes to\ninfinity limit must be the same. Our theory tells us how the initial state of\nthe walk should be chosen, and how many steps the walk must make in order to\nfind G.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Oct 2013 14:44:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 24 Jan 2014 14:36:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

Turbulent diffusion\nhas previously been applied to the magneto-rotational instability (MRI), but no\nquantitative comparison of growth rates at different turbulent intensities has\nbeen performed. We investigate to what extent turbulent diffusion can be used\nto model the effects of small-scale turbulence on the kinematic growth rates of\nthe MRI, and how this depends on angular velocity and magnetic field strength.\nWe use direct numerical simulations in three-dimensional shearing boxes with\nperiodic boundary conditions in the spanwise direction and additional random\nplane-wave volume forcing to drive a turbulent flow at a given length scale. We\nestimate the turbulent diffusivity using a mixing length formula and compare\nwith results obtained with the test-field method. It turns out that the concept\nof turbulent diffusion is remarkably accurate in describing the effect of\nturbulence on the growth rate of the MRI. No noticeable breakdown of turbulent\ndiffusion has been found, even when time and length scales of the turbulence\nbecome comparable with those imposed by the MRI itself. On the other hand,\nquenching of turbulent magnetic diffusivity by the magnetic field is found to\nbe absent.

We\nshow that, despite a wide-spread impression, the two theories are complementary\nrather than antagonist. Indeed, although Chirikov's 1979 review has thousands\nof citations, almost all of them refer to topics such as the resonance overlap\ncriterion, fast diffusion, the Standard or Whisker Map, and not to the\nconstructive theory providing a formula to measure diffusion along a single\nresonance. However, as will be demonstrated explicitly below, Chirikov's\nformula provides values of the diffusion coefficient which are quite well\ncomparable to the numerically computed ones, provided that it is implemented on\nthe so-called optimal normal form derived as in the analytic part of\nNekhoroshev's theorem. On the other hand, Chirikov's formula yields unrealistic\nvalues of the diffusion coefficient, in particular for very small values of the\nperturbation, when used in the original Hamiltonian instead of the optimal\nnormal form. In the present paper, we take advantage of this complementarity in\norder to obtain accurate theoretical predictions for the local value of the\ndiffusion coefficient along a resonance in a specific 3DoF nearly integrable\nHamiltonian system.

Despite its widespread use, there has been\nlittle analysis of its theoretical properties. Many of the algorithmic\ninnovations associated with the filter, which are required to make a useable\nalgorithm in practice, are derived in an ad hoc fashion. The aim of this paper\nis to initiate the development of a systematic analysis of the EnKF, in\nparticular to do so in the small ensemble size limit. The perspective is to\nview the method as a state estimator, and not as an algorithm which\napproximates the true filtering distribution. The perturbed observation version\nof the algorithm is studied, without and with variance inflation. Without\nvariance inflation well-posedness of the filter is established; with variance\ninflation accuracy of the filter, with resepct to the true signal underlying\nthe data, is established. The algorithm is considered in discrete time, and\nalso for a continuous time limit arising when observations are frequent and\nsubject to large noise. The underlying dynamical model, and assumptions about\nit, is sufficiently general to include the Lorenz '63 and '96 models, together\nwith the incompressible Navier-Stokes equation on a two-dimensional torus. The\nanalysis is limited to the case of complete observation of the signal with\nadditive white noise.

Systems are stable on\nthe MS if the planets are separated by more than ~9 Hill radii. Most systems\nsurviving the MS will remain stable until the WD phase, although planets\nscattered onto small pericentres in unstable systems can be swallowed by the\nexpanding stellar envelope when the star ascends the giant branches. Mass loss\nat the end of the asymptotic giant branch triggers delayed instability in many\nsystems, leading to instabilities typically occurring at WD cooling ages of a\nfew 100 Myr. This instability occurs both in systems that survived the star's\nprevious evolution unscathed, and in systems that previously underwent\nscattering instabilities. The outcome of such instability around WDs is\noverwhelmingly the ejection of one of the planets from the system, with several\ntimes more ejections occurring during the WD phase than during the MS.\nFurthermore, few planets are scattered close to the WD, just outside the Roche\nlimit, where they can be tidally circularised. Hence, we predict that planets\nin WD systems rarely dynamically evolve to become \"hot Jupiters\".

This\nfinding is also supported by independent static continuum-mechanics\ncalculations. In static experiments on macroscopic polymer structures\nfabricated by three-dimensional printing, we measure Poisson's ratios as low as\n-0.8 in good agreement with theory. Microscopic samples are also presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Oct 2013 09:30:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

This means that while observing the\nsolar photosphere, there has been no convenient way of calibrating the image\nscale of the telescope. Other telescopes, such as NASA's Solar Dynamics\nObservatory (SDO)utilize their larger Field of View (FOV) to use the solar disk\nas a reference in order to measure the image scale. In the past, the image\nscale of the SST has been determined by measuring the distance between the\nmoons of Jupiter in a captured SST image and comparing it to reference values,\nas well as with the Venus transit of 2004. Both of these methods have their\ndrawbacks, including needing to open the telescope at night or waiting for the\nvery rare occurrence of a solar transit, which the telescope may not even be in\na position to observe. Additionally, assessing the accuracy of these methods\ncan be difficult. The purpose of this thesis is to examine the feasibility of\nan idea proposed by the faculty of the Institute for Solar Physics at Stockholm\nUniversity, that would allow us to routinely calibrate the image scale of the\nSST when desired and with known accuracy of the measurement, without the need\nto open the telescope at night. The measurements performed so far are\nconsistent with the old value to about one third of a percent, with a total\nuncertainty of the SST/CRISP image scale of about 0.1 percent. Resulting in a\ngrid spacing of the pinhole array of 5.15 arcseconds, which can be used to\ndetermine the image scale of all the remaining science cameras of the SST.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Oct 2013 22:50:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-21"}

There exist many privacy-preserving works that\ncan deal with different attack models. In this paper, we introduce a novel\nprivacy attack model and refer it as a mutual friend attack. In this model, the\nadversary can re-identify a pair of friends by using their number of mutual\nfriends. To address this issue, we propose a new anonymity concept, called\nk-NMF anonymity, i.e., k-anonymity on the number of mutual friends, which\nensures that there exist at least k-1 other friend pairs in the graph that\nshare the same number of mutual friends. We devise algorithms to achieve the\nk-NMF anonymity while preserving the original vertex set in the sense that we\nallow the occasional addition but no deletion of vertices. Further we give an\nalgorithm to ensure the k-degree anonymity in addition to the k-NMF anonymity.\nThe experimental results on real-word datasets demonstrate that our approach\ncan preserve the privacy and utility of social networks effectively against\nmutual friend attacks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Oct 2013 03:52:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}
