It was recently proposed that the $Y(4260)$ should have a\nprominent $D_1\\bar{D}+c.c.$ molecular component that is strongly correlated\nwith the production of the charged $Z_c(3900)$. In this paper we demonstrate\nthat the nontrivial cross section line shapes of $e^+e^-\\to J/\\psi\\pi\\pi$ and\n$h_c\\pi\\pi$ can be naturally explained by the molecular scenario. As a\nconsequence we find a significantly smaller mass for the $Y(4260)$ than\nprevious studied. In the $e^+e^-\\to \\bar D D^*\\pi+c.c.$ process, with the\ninclusion of an additional $S$-wave $\\bar D^*\\pi$ contribution constrained\n  from data on the $D\\bar D^*$ invariant mass distribution, we obtain a good\nagreement with the data of the angular distributions. We also predict an\nunusual line shape of $Y(4260)$ in this channel that may serve as a smoking gun\nfor a predominantly molecular nature of $Y(4260)$. Improved measurements of\nthese observables are therefore crucial for a better understanding of the\nstructure of this famous resonance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Oct 2013 16:10:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 15 Jun 2014 09:44:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

From the 127 subdwarfs with substantial radial-velocity variations\ndiscovered in the initial survey, a number of interesting objects have been\nselected for extensive follow-up. After an initial photometry run with BUSCA\nrevealed that FBS 0117+396 is photometrically variable both on long and short\ntimescales, we chose it as an auxiliary target during a 6-night multi-color\nphotometry run with Ultracam. Spectroscopy was obtained at a number of\nobservatories in order to determine the binary period and obtain a\nradial-velocity amplitude. After establishing an orbital period of P = 0.252 d,\nand removing the signal associated with the irradiated hemisphere of the\nM-dwarf companion, we were able to detect ten pulsation periods in the Fourier\nspectrum of the light curve. Two pulsation modes are found to have short\nperiods of 337 and 379 s, and at least eight modes are found with periods\nbetween 45 minutes and 2.5 hours. This establishes that FBS 0117+396 is an\nsdB+dM reflection binary, in which the primary is a hybrid pulsator, and the\nfirst one found with this particular melange of flavours.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Oct 2013 17:59:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

Knowing the\nexpected temporal evolution of the proportion of normal tissue cells, compared\nto stem-like and non-stem like cancer cells, gives an indication about the\nprogression of the disease and indicates the expected response to interventions\nwith drugs. Such processes have been modeled using Markov processes. An\nessential step for the simulation of such models is then the determination of\nstate transition probabilities. We here consider the experimentally more\nrealistic scenario in which the measurement of cell population sizes is noisy,\nleading to a particular hidden Markov model. In this context, randomness in\nmeasurement is related to noisy measurements, which are used for the estimation\nof the transition probability matrix. Randomness in sampling, on the other\nhand, is here related to the error in estimating the state probability from\nsmall cell populations. Using aggregated data of fluorescence-activated cell\nsorting (FACS) measurement, we develop a minimum mean square error estimator\n(MMSE) and maximum likelihood (ML) estimator and formulate two problems to find\nthe minimum number of required samples and measurements to guarantee the\naccuracy of predicted population sizes using a transition probability matrix\nestimated from noisy data. We analyze the properties of two estimators for\ndifferent noise distributions and prove an optimal solution for Gaussian\ndistributions with the MMSE. Our numerical results show, that for noisy\nmeasurements the convergence mechanism of transition probabilities and steady\nstates differ widely from the real values if one uses the standard\ndeterministic approach in which measurements are assumed to be noise free.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Oct 2013 18:13:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Jan 2014 10:09:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-24"}

In a careful and homogeneous\nanalysis of the \"First stars\" sample (eighty per cent of the stars have a\nmetallicity [Fe/H]=-3.1$\\pm$0.4), it has been shown that at this metallicity\n[Eu/Ba] is constant, and therefore the Eu-rich stars (generally called\n\"r-rich\") are also Ba-rich. The very large variation of [Ba/Fe] (existence of\n\"r-poor\" and \"r-rich\" stars) induces that the early matter was not perfectly\nmixed. On the other hand, the distribution of the values of [Sr/Ba] vs. [Ba/Fe]\nappears with well defined upper and lower envelopes. No star was found with\n[Sr/Ba]<-0.5 and the scatter of [Sr/Ba] increases regularly when [Ba/Fe]\ndecreases. To explain this behavior, we suggest that an early \"additional\"\nprocess forming mainly first peak elements would affect the initial composition\nof the matter. For a same quantity of accreted matter, this additional Sr\nproduction would barely affect the r-rich matter (which already contains an\nimportant quantity of Sr) but would change significantly the composition of the\nr-poor matter. The abundances found in the CEMP-rs stars reflect the transfer\nof heavy elements from a defunct AGB companion. But the abundances of the heavy\nelements in CEMP-no stars present the same characteristics as the the\nabundances in the EMP stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Oct 2013 18:28:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

However, the contribution from z>6 galaxies to cosmic reionization\ncritically depends on the fraction of ionizing (Lyman continuum, LyC) photons\nescaping from these objects and into the intergalactic medium. At z<4, the\nescaping LyC flux can be measured directly, but the opacity of the neutral\nintergalactic medium precludes such measurements at higher redshifts. In a\nrecent paper, we argue that since the LyC escape fraction regulates the\ncontribution of nebular emission to the rest-frame optical/UV spectra of\ngalaxies, the James Webb Space Telescope should be able to indirectly assess\nthe LyC escape fraction for galaxies at z~6-9. JWST can, on the other hand, not\nconstrain the fraction of LyC photons directly absorbed by dust, and this is\nwhere SPICA comes in. The dust continuum emission from gravitationally lensed\nLyC-leakers at z=6 may in principle be detectable with SPICA, thereby\nconstraining the level of LyC extinction in these objects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Oct 2013 18:29:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-09"}

The peak mass occurs at a range of clustercentric distances, with median\nand 68th percentile range of 1.8 +2.3/-1.0 R_(vir,host) for progenitors of z=0\nsatellites. The peak circular velocity for infalling halos occurs at\nsignificantly larger distances (3.7 +3.3/-2.2 R_(vir,host) at z=0). This\ndifference arises because different physical processes set peak circular\nvelocity (typically, ~1:5 and larger mergers which cause transient circular\nvelocity spikes) and peak mass (typically, smooth accretion) for infalling\nhalos. We find that infalling halos also stop having significant mergers well\nbefore they enter the virial radius of their eventual hosts. Mergers larger\nthan a 1:40 ratio in halo mass end for infalling halos at similar\nclustercentric distances (~ 1.9 R_(vir,host)) as the end of overall mass\naccretion. However, mergers larger than 1:3 typically end for infalling halos\nat more than 4 virial radial away from their eventual hosts. This limits the\nability of mergers to affect quenching and morphology changes in clusters.

In this paper, we report the\ndiscovery of an arc-like nebula around the late M-type star IRC-10414 using the\nSuperCOSMOS H-alpha Survey. Our spectroscopic follow-up of IRC-10414 with the\nSouthern African Large Telescope (SALT) showed that it is a M7 supergiant,\nwhich supports previous claims on the RSG nature of this star based on\nobservations of its maser emission. This was reinforced by our new radio- and\n(sub)millimeter-wavelength molecular line observations made with the Atacama\nPathfinder Experiment (APEX) 12 meter telescope and the Effelsberg 100 m radio\ntelescope, respectively. The SALT spectrum of the nebula indicates that its\nemission is the result of shock excitation.

Thus,\nIRC-10414 represents the third case of a bow-shock-producing RSG and the first\none with a bow shock visible at optical wavelengths. We discuss the smooth\nappearance of the bow shocks around IRC-10414 and Betelgeuse and propose that\none of the necessary conditions for stability of bow shocks generated by RSGs\nis the ionization of the stellar wind. Possible ionisation sources of the wind\nof IRC-10414 are proposed and discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Oct 2013 20:00:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Oct 2013 12:09:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

In particular, we determine whether additional sources of\nturbulence within a dead zone are capable of suppressing gravo-magneto (GM)\ndisc outbursts that arise from a rapid transition from gravitationally produced\nto MRI produced turbulence. With viscous $\\alpha$ disc models we consider two\nmechanisms that may drive turbulence within the dead zone. First, we examine a\nconstant $\\alpha$ parameter within the dead zone. This may be applicable to\nhydrodynamical instability, such as baroclinic instability, where the\nturbulence level is independent of the MRI active surface layer properties. In\nthis case, we find that the disc will not become stable to the outbursts unless\nthe dead zone turbulent viscosity is comparable to that in the MRI active\nsurface layers. Under such conditions, the accretion rate through the dead zone\nmust be larger than that through the MRI active layers. In a second model, we\nassume that the accretion flow though the dead zone is a constant fraction\n(less than unity) of that through the active layers. This may be applicable to\nturbulence driven by hydrodynamic waves that are excited by the MRI active\nsurface layers. We find that the instability is hardly affected by the viscous\ndead zone. In both cases however, we find that the triggering of the MRI during\nthe outburst may be due to the heating from the viscosity in the dead zone,\nrather than self-gravity. Thus, neither mechanism for generating turbulence\nwithin the dead zone can significantly stabilise a disc or the resulting\noutburst behaviour.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Oct 2013 22:17:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

However, their progenitors are still uncertain. We study\nwhether the population properties of this class might be understood if the\nevents originate from a subset of sub-Chandrasekhar mass explosions. In this\npotential progenitor population, a carbon--oxygen white dwarf (CO WD)\naccumulates a helium layer from a non-degenerate helium star; ignition of that\nhelium layer then leads to ignition of the CO WD. We incorporated detailed\nbinary evolution calculations for the progenitor systems into a binary\npopulation synthesis model to obtain rates and delay times for such events. The\npredicted Galactic event rate of these explosions is ~1.5\\times10^{-3}{yr}^{-1}\naccording to our standard model, in good agreement with the measured rates of\nSNe Iax. In addition, predicted delay times are ~70Myr-800Myr, consistent with\nthe fact that most of SNe Iax have been discovered in late-type galaxies. If\nthe explosions are assumed to be double-detonations -- following current model\nexpectations -- then based on the CO WD masses at explosion we also estimate\nthe distribution of resulting SN brightness (-13 \\gtrsim M_{bol} \\gtrsim\n-19mag), which can reproduce the empirical diversity of SNe Iax. We speculate\non why binaries with non-degenerate donor stars might lead to SNe Iax if\nsimilar systems with degenerate donors do not.

Additionally,\nsatisfiability-preserving clause elimination procedures are often used. Since\nMaxSAT computation typically involves a large number of SAT calls, we are\ninterested in whether an input instance to a MaxSAT problem can be preprocessed\nup-front, i.e. prior to running the MaxSAT solver, rather than (or, in addition\nto) during each iterative SAT solver call.

We present a new way of building high performance\ninterpreters that is particularly effective for executing dynamically typed\nprogramming languages. The key idea is to combine speculative staging of\noptimized interpreter instructions with a novel technique of incrementally and\niteratively concerting them at run-time.\n  This paper introduces the concepts behind deriving optimized instructions\nfrom existing interpreter instructions---incrementally peeling off layers of\ncomplexity. When compiling the interpreter, these optimized derivatives will be\ncompiled along with the original interpreter instructions. Therefore, our\ntechnique is portable by construction since it leverages the existing\ncompiler's backend. At run-time we use instruction substitution from the\ninterpreter's original and expensive instructions to optimized instruction\nderivatives to speed up execution.\n  Our technique unites high performance with the simplicity and portability of\ninterpreters---we report that our optimization makes the CPython interpreter up\nto more than four times faster, where our interpreter closes the gap between\nand sometimes even outperforms PyPy's just-in-time compiler.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Oct 2013 22:44:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-10"}

The WISE catalog thus provides a substantial increase in\nthe quantity of IR data available for these sources: 17 are detected in the\nWISE W1 (3.4-micron) band, 16 in W2 (4.6-micron), 3 in W3 (12-micron) and 0 in\nW4 (22-micron). This is particularly important with Spitzer in its warm-mission\nphase and no faint follow-up capability at wavelengths longwards of 5 microns\nuntil the launch of JWST. WISE thus provides a useful tool for understanding\nQSOs found in forthcoming large-area optical/IR sky surveys, using PanSTARRS,\nSkyMapper, VISTA, DES and LSST. The rest-UV properties of the WISE-detected and\nthe WISE-non-detected samples differ: the detections have brighter i/z-band\nmagnitudes and redder rest-UV colors. This suggests that a more aggressive hunt\nfor very-high-redshift QSOs, by combining WISE W1 and W2 data with red observed\noptical colors could be effective at least for a subset of dusty candidate\nQSOs.

Our evaluation\nresults from implementation on different android devices in both city and\nhighway driving show that Dejavu can localize cell phones to within 8.4m median\nerror in city roads and 16.6m on highways. Moreover, compared to GPS and other\nstate-of-the-art systems, Dejavu can extend the battery lifetime by 347%,\nachieving even better localization results than GPS in the more challenging\nin-city driving conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Oct 2013 04:38:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-10"}

However, the amount of spectrum that can be used to\nsatisfy these demands remains finite. This leads to a great challenge for\nwireless users to effectively share the spectrum to achieve their QoS\nrequirements. This paper presents a game theoretic model for spectrum sharing,\nwhere users seek to satisfy their QoS demands in a distributed fashion. Our\nspectrum sharing model is quite general, because we allow different wireless\nchannels to provide different QoS, depending upon their channel conditions and\nhow many users are trying to access them. Also, users can be highly\nheterogeneous, with different QoS demands, depending upon their activities,\nhardware capabilities, and technology choices. Under such a general setting, we\nshow that it is NP hard to find a spectrum allocation which satisfies the\nmaximum number of users' QoS requirements in a centralized fashion. We also\nshow that allowing users to self-organize through distributed channel\nselections is a viable alternative to the centralized optimization, because\nbetter response updating is guaranteed to reach a pure Nash equilibria in\npolynomial time. By bounding the price of anarchy, we demonstrate that the\nworst case pure Nash equilibrium can be close to optimal, when users and\nchannels are not very heterogenous. We also extend our model by considering the\nfrequency spatial reuse, and consider the user interactions as a game upon a\ngraph where players only contend with their neighbors. We prove that better\nresponse updating is still guaranteed to reach a pure Nash equilibrium in this\nmore general spatial QoS satisfaction game.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Oct 2013 05:29:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-10"}

We find no evidence of GW signals from cosmic strings. From this result,\nwe derive new constraints on cosmic string parameters, which complement and\nimprove existing limits from previous searches for a stochastic background of\nGWs from cosmic microwave background measurements and pulsar timing data.

By the same reduction, it is easy to\nfind a minimal or maximal d-factor of a graph. However, if we require that the\nd-factor is connected, these problems become NP-hard - finding a minimal\nconnected 2-factor is just the traveling salesman problem (TSP).\n  Given a complete graph with edge weights that satisfy the triangle\ninequality, we consider the problem of finding a minimal connected $d$-factor.\nWe give a 3-approximation for all $d$ and improve this to an\n(r+1)-approximation for even d, where r is the approximation ratio of the TSP.\nThis yields a 2.5-approximation for even d. The same algorithm yields an\n(r+1)-approximation for the directed version of the problem, where r is the\napproximation ratio of the asymmetric TSP. We also show that none of these\nminimization problems can be approximated better than the corresponding TSP.\n  Finally, for the decision problem of deciding whether a given graph contains\na connected d-factor, we extend known hardness results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Oct 2013 08:23:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-10"}

We have found two distinct sequences of BSS: this is the second case,\nafter M 30, where such a feature has been observed. Indeed the BSS location,\ntheir extension in magnitude and color and their radial distribution within the\ncluster nicely resemble those observed in M 30, thus suggesting that the same\ninterpretative scenario can be applied: the red BSS sub-population is generated\nby mass transfer binaries, the blue one by collisions. The discovery of four\nnew W UMa stars, three of which lying along the red-BSS sequence, further\nsupports this scenario. We also found that the inner portion of the density\nprofile deviates from a King model and is well reproduced by either a mild\npower-law (\\alpha -0.2) or a double King profile. This feature supports the\nhypothesis that the cluster is currently undergoing the core collapse phase.\nMoreover, the BSS radial distribution shows a central peak and monotonically\ndecreases outward without any evidence of an external rising branch. This\nevidence is a further indication of the advanced dynamical age of NGC 362: in\nfact, together with M 30, NGC 362 belongs to the family of dynamically old\nclusters (Family III) in the \"dynamical clock\" classification proposed by\nFerraro et al.

Microscopic modelling can\nhelp to quantify the relationship between individual motors plus filaments to\norganisation and dynamics on molecular and supra-molecular length scales. Here\nwe present results of extensive numerical simulations of active gels where the\nmotors and filaments are confined between two infinite parallel plates. Thermal\nfluctuations and excluded-volume interactions between filaments are included. A\nsystematic variation of rates for motor motion, attachment and detachment,\nincluding a differential detachment rate from filament ends, reveals a range of\nnon-equilibrium behaviour. Strong motor binding produces structured filament\naggregates that we refer to as asters, bundles or layers, whose stability\ndepends on motor speed and differential end-detachment. The gross features of\nthe dependence of the observed structures on the motor rate and the filament\nconcentration can be captured by a simple one-filament model. Loosely bound\naggregates exhibit super-diffusive mass transport, where filament translocation\nscales with lag time with non-unique exponents that depend on motor kinetics.\nAn empirical data collapse of filament speed as a function of motor speed and\nend-detachment is found, suggesting a dimensional reduction of the relevant\nparameter space. We conclude by discussing the perspectives of microscopic\nmodelling in the field of active gels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Oct 2013 08:38:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 26 Feb 2014 18:52:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

However, existing RTMs have limitations in both\nthe restricted model expressiveness and incapability of dealing with imbalanced\nnetwork data. To expand the scope and improve the inference accuracy of RTMs,\nthis paper presents three extensions: 1) unlike the common link likelihood with\na diagonal weight matrix that allows the-same-topic interactions only, we\ngeneralize it to use a full weight matrix that captures all pairwise topic\ninteractions and is applicable to asymmetric networks; 2) instead of doing\nstandard Bayesian inference, we perform regularized Bayesian inference\n(RegBayes) with a regularization parameter to deal with the imbalanced link\nstructure issue in common real networks and improve the discriminative ability\nof learned latent representations; and 3) instead of doing variational\napproximation with strict mean-field assumptions, we present collapsed Gibbs\nsampling algorithms for the generalized relational topic models by exploring\ndata augmentation without making restricting assumptions.

Here, we report a novel approach to study how proteins\ntraffic to and from the immune synapse using NK cell receptors tagged with the\nphotoswitchable fluorescent protein tdEosFP, which can be irreversibly\nphotoswitched from a green to red fluorescent state by ultraviolet light. Thus,\nfollowing a localized switching event, the movement of the photoswitched\nmolecules can be temporally and spatially resolved by monitoring fluorescence\nin two regions of interest. By comparing images with mathematical models, we\nevaluated the diffusion coefficient of the receptor KIR2DL1 (0.23 +- 0.06\nmicron^2/s) and assessed how synapse formation affects receptor dynamics. Our\ndata conclude that the inhibitory NK cell receptor KIR2DL1 is continually\ntrafficked into the synapse and remains surprisingly stable there.

Its computation on the image grid raises\nmany issues. Due to the effects of discretization, the required properties of\nthe skeleton - thinness, homotopy to the shape, reversibility, connectivity -\nmay become incompatible. However, as regards practical use, the choice of a\nspecific skeletonization algorithm depends on the application. This allows to\nclassify the desired properties by order of importance, and tend towards the\nmost critical ones. Our goal is to make a skeleton dedicated to shape matching\nfor recognition. So, the discrete skeleton has to be thin - so that it can be\nrepresented by a graph -, robust to noise, reversible - so that the initial\nshape can be fully reconstructed - and homotopic to the shape. We propose a\nlinear-time skeletonization algorithm based on the squared Euclidean distance\nmap from which we extract the maximal balls and ridges. After a thinning and\npruning process, we obtain the skeleton.

It is\ntherefore important to determine which properties of neurons influence their\ncollective behavior in a network and to understand how. A prominent feature of\nmany cortical neurons is spike frequency adaptation, which is caused by slow\ntransmembrane currents. We investigated how these adaptation currents affect\nthe synchronization tendency of coupled model neurons. Using the efficient\nadaptive exponential integrate-and-fire (aEIF) model and a biophysically\ndetailed neuron model for validation, we found that increased adaptation\ncurrents promote synchronization of coupled excitatory neurons at lower spike\nfrequencies, as long as the conduction delays between the neurons are\nnegligible. Inhibitory neurons on the other hand synchronize in presence of\nconduction delays, with or without adaptation currents. Our results emphasize\nthe utility of the aEIF model for computational studies of neuronal network\ndynamics. We conclude that adaptation currents provide a mechanism to generate\nlow frequency oscillations in local populations of excitatory neurons, while\nfaster rhythms seem to be caused by inhibition rather than excitation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Oct 2013 11:05:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-06"}

In a viral marketing campaign, a firm initially\ntargets a small set of pioneers and hopes that they would influence a sizeable\nfraction of the population by diffusion of influence through the network. In\ngeneral, any marketing campaign might fail to go viral in the first try. As\nsuch, it would be useful to have some guide to evaluate the effectiveness of\nthe campaign and judge whether it is worthy of further resources, and in case\nthe campaign has potential, how to hit upon a good pioneer who can make the\ncampaign go viral. In this paper, we present a diffusion model developed by\nenriching the generalized random graph (a.k.a. configuration model) to provide\ninsight into these questions. We offer the intuition behind the results on this\nmodel, rigorously proved in Blaszczyszyn & Gaurav(2013), and illustrate them\nhere by taking examples of random networks having prototypical degree\ndistributions - Poisson degree distribution, which is commonly used as a kind\nof benchmark, and Power Law degree distribution, which is normally used to\napproximate the real-world networks. On these networks, the members are assumed\nto have varying attitudes towards propagating the information. We analyze three\ncases, in particular - (1) Bernoulli transmissions, when a member influences\neach of its friend with probability p; (2) Node percolation, when a member\ninfluences all its friends with probability p and none with probability 1-p;\n(3) Coupon-collector transmissions, when a member randomly selects one of his\nfriends K times with replacement. We assume that the configuration model is the\nclosest approximation of a large online social network, when the information\navailable about the network is very limited. The key insight offered by this\nstudy from a firm's perspective is regarding how to evaluate the effectiveness\nof a marketing campaign and do cost-benefit analysis by collecting relevant\nstatistical data from the pioneers it selects. The campaign evaluation\ncriterion is informed by the observation that if the parameters of the\nunderlying network and the campaign effectiveness are such that the campaign\ncan indeed reach a significant fraction of the population, then the set of good\npioneers also forms a significant fraction of the population. Therefore, in\nsuch a case, the firms can even adopt the naive strategy of repeatedly picking\nand targeting some number of pioneers at random from the population. With this\nstrategy, the probability of them picking a good pioneer will increase\ngeometrically fast with the number of tries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Oct 2013 11:43:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-10"}

In this thesis we study and\ncompare two major strategies known for their decoding procedure, the\nPeterson-Gorenstein-Zierler (PGZ) and the Berlekamp-Massey (BM) decoder, in\norder to improve existing decoding algorithms and propose faster new ones. In\nparticular we study a modified version of the PGZ decoder, which we will call\nthe fast Peterson-Gorenstein-Zierler (fPGZ) decoding algorithm. This\nimprovement was presented in 1997 by exploiting the Hankel structure of the\nsyndrome matrix. In this thesis we show that the fPGZ decoding algorithm can be\nseen as a particular case of the BM one. Indeed we prove that the intermediate\noutcomes obtained in the implementation of fPGZ are a subset of those of the BM\ndecoding algorithm. In this way, we also uncover the existing relationship\nbetween the leading principal minors of syndrome matrix and the discrepancies\ncomputed by the BM algorithm. Finally, thanks to the study done on the\nstructure of the syndrome matrix and its leading principal minors, we improve\nthe error value computation in both the decoding strategies studied\n(specifically we prove new error value formulas for the fPGZ and the BM\ndecoding algorithm) and moreover we state a new iterative formulation of the\nPGZ decoder well suited to a parallel implementation on integrated microchips.\nThus using techniques of linear algebra we obtain a parallel decoding algorithm\nfor Reed-Solomon codes with an O(e) computational time complexity, where e is\nthe number of errors which occurred, although a fairly large number of\nelementary circuit elements is needed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Oct 2013 17:49:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-10"}

The diffusion equation for\nCompton scattering is coupled to a single-temperature pair gas and an exact\n(trans-relativistic) cyclo-synchrotron photon source.

Defects often play a central role in ionic and electronic solids, not\nonly to limit reliability, but more importantly to enable the functionalities\nthat make these materials of critical importance. Examples include solid\nelectrolytes that conduct current through the motion of charged point defects,\nand complex oxide ferroelectrics that display multifunctionality through the\nmotion of domain wall defects. Therefore, it is important to understand the\nstructure of defects and their response to electrical and mechanical fields. A\ncentral hurdle, however, is that interactions in ionic solids include both\nshort-range atomic interactions as well as long-range electrostatic\ninteractions. Existing atomistic-to-continuum multi-scale methods, such as the\nQuasicontinuum method, are applicable only when the atomic interactions are\nshort-range. In addition, empirical reductions of quantum mechanics to density\nfunctional models are unable to capture key phenomena of interest in these\nmaterials. To address this open problem, we develop a multiscale atomistic\nmethod to coarse-grain the long-range electrical interactions in ionic crystals\nwith defects. In these settings, the charge density is rapidly varying, but in\nan almost-periodic manner. The key idea is to use the polarization density\nfield as a multiscale mediator that enables efficient coarse-graining by\nexploiting the almost-periodic nature of the variation. In regions far from the\ndefect, where the crystal is close-to-perfect, the polarization field serves as\na proxy that enables us to avoid accounting for the details of the charge\nvariation. We combine this approach for long-range electrostatics with the\nstandard Quasicontinuum method for short-range interactions to achieve an\nefficient multiscale atomistic-to-continuum method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Oct 2013 14:37:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-11"}

The positions of all surface particles are\ndetermined explicitly, according to the local potential minima resulting from\nthe pair-wise interactions of contiguous atoms and molecules, rather than by a\npre-defined lattice structure. The model is capable of simulating chemical\nkinetics on any arbitrary dust-grain morphology, as determined by the\nuser-defined positions of each individual dust-grain atom. A simple method is\ndevised for the determination of the most likely diffusion pathways and their\nassociated energy barriers for surface species. The model is applied to a\nsmall, idealized dust grain, adopting various gas densities and using a small\nchemical network. Hydrogen and oxygen atoms accrete onto the grain, to produce\nH2O, H2, O2 and H2O2. The off-lattice method allows the ice structure to evolve\nfreely; ice mantle porosity is found to be dependent on the gas density, which\ncontrols the accretion rate. A gas density of 2 x 10^{4} cm^{-3}, appropriate\nto dark interstellar clouds, is found to produce a fairly smooth and non-porous\nice mantle. At all densities, H2 molecules formed on the grains collect within\nthe crevices that divide nodules of ice, and within micropores (whose extreme\ninward curvature produces strong local potential minima). The larger pores\nproduced in the high-density models are not typically filled with H2. Direct\ndeposition of water molecules onto the grain indicates that amorphous ices\nformed in this way may be significantly more porous than interstellar ices that\nare formed by surface chemistry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Oct 2013 15:00:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

We derive Markovian kinetic equations for the\nensemble-averaged state of the SQD-qubit system, expressed in the coupled\ndynamics of two charge-state occupations of the SQD and two qubit isospin\nvectors, one for each SQD charge state. We find that aside from introducing\ndissipation, the detection also renormalizes the coherent evolution of the\nSQD-qubit system. Basically, if the electron on the detector has time to probe\nthe qubit, then it also has time to fluctuate and thereby renormalize the\nsystem parameters. In particular, this induces torques on the qubit isospins,\nsimilar to the spin torque generated by the spintronic exchange field in\nnoncollinear spin-valve structures. Secondly, we show that for a consistent\ndescription of the detection, one must also include the renormalization effects\nin the next-to-leading order in the electron tunneling rates, especially at the\npoint of maximal sensitivity of the detector. Although we focus on a\ncharge-qubit model, our findings are generic for qubit readout schemes that are\nbased on spin-to-charge conversion using a quantum-dot detector. Furthermore,\nour study of the stationary current through the SQD, a test measurement\nverifying that the qubit couples to the detector current, already reveals\nvarious significant effects of the isospin torques on the qubit. Our kinetic\nequations provide a starting point for further studies of the time evolution in\ncharge-based qubit readout.

It\nwas the target of an extensive observing campaign and was visited by the Deep\nImpact spacecraft (mission EPOXI). We present observations of HCN and CH3OH\nemission lines conducted with the IRAM Plateau de Bure interferometer on 22-23,\n28 October and 4, 5 November 2010 at 1.1, 1.9 and 3.4 mm wavelengths. The\nthermal emission from the dust coma and nucleus is detected simultaneously.\nInterferometric images with unprecedented spatial resolution are obtained. A\nsine-wave variation of the thermal continuum is observed in the 23 October\ndata, that we associate with the nucleus thermal light curve. The nucleus\ncontributes up to 30-55 % of the observed continuum. The large dust-to-gas\nratio (in the range 2-6) can be explained by the unusual activity of the comet\nfor its size, which allows decimeter size particles and large boulders to be\nentrained by the gas. The rotational temperature of CH3OH is measured. We\nattribute the increase from 35 to 46 K with increasing beam size (from 150 to\n1500 km) to radiative processes. The HCN production rate displays strong\nrotation-induced variations. The HCN production curve, as well as those of CO2\nand H2O measured by EPOXI, are interpreted with a geometric model which takes\ninto account the rotation and the shape of the comet. The HCN and H2O\nproduction curves are in phase, showing common sources. The 1.7h delay, in\naverage, of HCN and H2O with respect to the CO2 production curve suggests that\nHCN and H2O are mainly produced by subliming icy grains. The scale length of\nproduction of HCN is determined to be on the order of 500-1000 km, implying a\nmean velocity of 100-200 m/s for the icy grains producing HCN. The modulation\nof the CO2 prouction and of the velocity offset of the HCN lines are\ninterpreted in terms of localized sources of gas on the nucleus surface.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Oct 2013 14:12:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

Since by deciding the best supplier, companies can save material\ncosts and increase competitive advantage.However this decision becomes\ncompilcated in case of multiple suppliers, multiple conflicting criteria, and\nimprecise parameters. In addition the uncertainty and vagueness of the experts'\nopinion is the prominent characteristic of the problem. therefore an\nextensively used multi criteria decision making tool Fuzzy AHP can be utilized\nas an approach for supplier selection problem. This paper reveals the\napplication of Fuzzy AHP in a gear motor company determining the best supplier\nwith respect to selected criteria. the contribution of this study is not only\nthe application of the Fuzzy AHP methodology for supplier selection problem,\nbut also releasing a comprehensive literature review of multi criteria decision\nmaking problems. In addition by stating the steps of Fuzzy AHP clearly and\nnumerically, this study can be a guide of the methodology to be implemented to\nother multiple criteria decision making problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Oct 2013 08:50:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-13"}
