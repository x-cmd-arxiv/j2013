We describe the various methods\nused to assign distances extracted from the literature, and solve the distance\nambiguities towards ~200 sources located within the Solar circle using archival\nHI data. These distances are used to calculate bolometric luminosities and\nestimate the survey completeness (~2x10^4 lsun). In total, we calculate the\ndistance and luminosity of ~1650 sources, one third of which are above the\nsurvey's completeness threshold. Examination of the sample's longitude,\nlatitude, radial velocities and mid-infrared images has identified ~120 small\ngroups of sources, many of which are associated with well known star formation\ncomplexes, such as W43, W49 and W51.\n  We compare the positional distribution of the sample with the expected\nlocations of the spiral arms, assuming a model of the Galaxy consisting of four\ngaseous arms. The distribution of young massive stars in the Milky Way is\nspatially correlated with the spiral arms, with strong peaks in the source\nposition and luminosity distributions at the arms' Galactocentric radii. The\noverall source and luminosity surface densities are both well correlated with\nthe surface density of the molecular gas, which suggests that the massive star\nformation rate per unit molecular mass is approximately constant across the\nGalaxy.\n  We estimate the total luminosity of the embedded massive star population to\nbe ~0.76x10^8 lsun, 30% of which is associated with the ten most active star\nforming complexes. We measure the scale height as a function of Galactocentric\ndistance and find that it increases only modestly from ~20-30 pc between 4 and\n8 kpc, but much more rapidly at larger distances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Oct 2013 16:04:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

EVE\nobserves both high temperature Fe emission lines (Fe XV-Fe XXIV) and continuum\nemission from thermal bremsstrahlung that is proportional to the abundance of\nH. By comparing the relative intensities of line and continuum emission it is\npossible to determine the enrichment of the flare plasma relative to the\ncomposition of the photosphere. This is the first ionization potential or FIP\nbias ($f$). Since thermal bremsstrahlung at EUV wavelengths is relatively\ninsensitive to the electron temperature, it is important to account for the\ndistribution of electron temperatures in the emitting plasma. We accomplish\nthis by using the observed spectra to infer the differential emission measure\ndistribution and FIP bias simultaneously. In each of the 21 flares that we\nanalyze we find that the observed composition is close to photospheric. The\nmean FIP bias in our sample is $f=1.27\\pm0.23$.

The\nkey point is that the locus of emission of Hawking radiation is not the\nglobally defined event horizon. Rather the emission domain lies just outside a\ntimelike Marginal Outer Trapped Surface that is locally defined. The emission\ndomain is mainly located inside the event horizon. A spacelike singularity\nforms behind the event horizon, and most of the Hawking radiation ends up at\nthis singularity rather than at infinity. Whether any Hawking radiation reaches\ninfinity depends on the relation between the emission domain and the event\nhorizon. From the outside view, even if radiation is seen as always being\nemitted, the black hole never evaporates away, rather its mass and entropy\nasymptote to finite non-zero limits, and the event horizon always acts as a\nsink for matter and information. From an inside view, the matter and\ninformation disappear into the singularity, which is the boundary of spacetime.\nThe argument is based on the nature of the processes at work plus a careful\ndelineation of the relevant causal domains; in order to confirm this model and\ndetermine details of the outcome, detailed calculations of the expectation\nvalue of the stress-energy-momentum tensor are needed to determine back\nreaction effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Oct 2013 16:56:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 20 Oct 2013 06:05:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-22"}

For each\nserving file to users, a cellular base station determines either to broadcast\nor unicast the file based on user demand prediction examining the file's\ncontent specific characteristics such as: file size, delay tolerance, price\nsensitivity. In a network operator's revenue maximization perspective while not\ninflicting any user payoff degradation, we jointly optimize resource\nallocation, pricing, and file scheduling. In accordance with the state of the\nart LTE specifications, the proposed network demonstrates up to 32% increase in\nrevenue for a single cell and more than a 7-fold increase for a 7 cell\ncoordinated LTE broadcast network, compared to the conventional unicast\ncellular networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Oct 2013 17:15:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Jan 2014 15:55:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-21"}

The steady states are built by connecting\nhomogeneously two infinite halves of the system thermalized at different\ntemperatures $T_l$, $T_r$, and waiting for a long time. We evaluate the current\n$J(T_l,T_r)$ using the exact QFT density matrix describing these\nnon-equilibrium steady states and using Al.B.

We verify our formula in particular by showing that the conformal field\ntheory (CFT) result is obtained in the high-temperature limit. We analyze\nnumerically our non-equilibrium steady-state TBA equations for three models:\nthe sinh-Gordon model, the roaming trajectories model, and the sine-Gordon\nmodel at a particular reflectionless point.

All of these effects\nare expected to have a significant dependence on the size of the nuclear target\nand the impact parameter of the collision, also known as the collision\ncentrality. In this article, we detail a method for determining centrality\nclasses in p(d)+A collisions via cuts on the multiplicity at backward rapidity\n(i.e., the nucleus-going direction) and for determining systematic\nuncertainties in this procedure. For d+Au collisions at sqrt(s_NN) = 200 GeV we\nfind that the connection to geometry is confirmed by measuring the fraction of\nevents in which a neutron from the deuteron does not interact with the nucleus.\nAs an application, we consider the nuclear modification factors R_{p(d)+A}, for\nwhich there is a potential bias in the measured centrality dependent yields due\nto auto-correlations between the process of interest and the backward rapidity\nmultiplicity. We determine the bias correction factor within this framework.\nThis method is further tested using the HIJING Monte Carlo generator. We find\nthat for d+Au collisions at sqrt(s_NN)=200 GeV, these bias corrections are\nsmall and vary by less than 5% (10%) up to p_T = 10 (20) GeV. In contrast, for\np+Pb collisions at sqrt(s_NN) = 5.02 TeV we find these bias factors are an\norder of magnitude larger and strongly p_T dependent, likely due to the larger\neffect of multi-parton interactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Oct 2013 18:43:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-13"}

In most of the models, the bounce has been studied using\nnumerical simulations involving states which are sharply peaked and which\nbounce at volumes much larger than the Planck volume. An important issue is to\nconfirm the existence of the bounce for states which have a wide spread, or\nwhich bounce closer to the Planck volume. Numerical simulations with such\nstates demand large computational domains, making them very expensive and\npractically infeasible with the techniques which have been implemented so far.\nTo overcome these difficulties, we present an efficient hybrid numerical scheme\nusing the property that at the small spacetime curvature, the quantum\nHamiltonian constraint in LQC, which is a difference equation with uniform\ndiscretization in volume, can be approximated by a Wheeler-DeWitt differential\nequation. By carefully choosing a hybrid spatial grid allowing the use of\npartial differential equations at large volumes, and with a simple change of\ngeometrical coordinate, we obtain a surprising reduction in the computational\ncost. This scheme enables us to explore regimes which were so far unachievable\nfor the isotropic model in LQC. Our approach also promises to significantly\nreduce the computational cost for numerical simulations in anisotropic LQC\nusing high performance computing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Oct 2013 18:46:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Nov 2013 18:51:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-20"}

We decompose the wave field in propagating and evanescent transverse\nelectric and magnetic modes with random amplitudes that encode the cumulative\nscattering effects. They satisfy a coupled system of stochastic differential\nequations driven by the random fluctuations of the electric permittivity.

The result is a detailed characterization of the transport of energy\nin the waveguide, the loss of coherence of the modes and the depolarization of\nthe waves due to cumulative scattering.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Oct 2013 02:52:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-21"}

An\nexperiment simulating a starlight suppression system is currently developed at\nNASA Ames Research Center, and includes a LOWFS controlling tip/tilt modes in\nreal-time at 500 Hz.

The\ngrain motion and the fluid pressure influence each other: It is well\nestablished that when the fluid pressure rises, the shear resistance of\nfluid-filled granular systems decreases, and as a result catastrophic events\nsuch as soil liquefaction, earthquakes, and accelerating landslides may be\ntriggered. Alternatively, when the pore pressure drops, the shear resistance of\nthese systems increases. Despite the great importance of the coupled mechanics\nof grains-fluid systems, the basic physics that controls this coupling is far\nfrom understood. We developed a new multi-scaled model based on the discrete\nelement method, coupled with a continuum model of fluid pressure, to explore\nthis dynamical system. The model was shown recently to capture essential\nfeedbacks between porosity changes arising from rearrangement of grains, and\nlocal pressure variations due to changing pore configurations. We report here\nnew results from numerical experiments of a continuously shearing layer of\ncircular two-dimensional grains, trapped between two parallel rough boundaries.\nThe experiments use a fixed confining stress on the boundary walls, and a\nconstant velocity applied to one of the boundaries, as if this system was the\ninterior of a sliding geological fault filled with 'fault gouge'. In addition,\nwe control the layer permeability and the drainage boundary conditions. This\npaper presents modeling results showing that the localization of shear (into a\nnarrow shear band within the shearing layer) is strongly affected by the\npresence of fluids. While in dry granular layers there is no preferred position\nfor the onset of localization, drained systems tend to localize shear on their\nboundary. We propose a scaling argument to describe the pressure deviations in\na shear band, and use that to predict the allowable positions of shear\nlocalizations as a function of the fault and gouge properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Oct 2013 04:30:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-21"}

As a working example the Lattice Limit Cycle (LLC) model is used. Its\ncorresponding abstract network is constructed and the transition matrix\nelements are computed via Kinetic (Dynamic) Monte Carlo simulations. For this\nmodel it is shown that the degree distribution follows a power law with\nexponent -1, while the average clustering coefficient $c(N)$ scales with the\nnetwork size (number of nodes) $N$ as $c(N)\\sim N^{-\\nu}, \\nu \\simeq 1.46$. The\ncomputed exponents classify the LLC abstract reactive network into the\nscale-free networks. This conclusion corroborates earlier investigations\ndemonstrating the formation of fractal spatial patterns in LLC reactive\ndynamics due to stochasticity and to the clustering of homologous species. The\npresent construction of abstract networks (based on the partition of the phase\nspace) is generic and can be implemented with appropriate adjustments in many\ndynamical systems and in time series analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Oct 2013 07:00:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

This framework allows more accurate analysis of\nperformance of online scheduling algorithms, even in worst-case arrival and\nerror scenarios. We design an online algorithm for scheduling packets of\narbitrary lengths, achieving optimal relative throughput in the range (1/3,1/2]\n(the exact value depends on packet lengths). In other words, for any arrival\nand jamming patterns, our solution gives throughput which is no more than c\ntimes worse than the best possible scheduling for these patters, where c in [2;\n3) is the inverse of relative throughput. Another algorithm we design makes use\nof additional resources in order to achieve relative throughput 1, that is, it\nachieves at least as high throughput as the best schedule without such\nresources, for any arrival and jamming patterns.

In order to prevent falls\nwhile walking, one should rely on relevant early indicators of impaired dynamic\nbalance. The local dynamic stability (LDS) represents the sensitivity of gait\nto small perturbations: divergence exponents (maximal Lyapunov exponents)\nassess how fast a dynamical system diverges from neighbor points. Although\nnumerous findings attest the validity of LDS as a fall risk index, reliability\nresults are still sparse. The present study explores the intrasession and\nintersession repeatability of gait LDS using intraclass correlation\ncoefficients (ICC) and standard error of measurement (SEM). Ninety-five healthy\nindividuals performed 5min. treadmill walking in two sessions separated by 9\ndays. Trunk acceleration was measured with a 3D accelerometer. Three time\nscales were used to estimate LDS: over 4 to 10 strides ({\\lambda}4-10), over\none stride ({\\lambda}1) and over one step ({\\lambda}0.5). The intrasession\nrepeatability was assessed from three repetitions of either 35 strides or 70\nstrides taken within the 5min tests. The intersession repeatability compared\nthe two sessions, which totalized 210 strides. The intrasession ICCs\n(70-strides estimates/35-strides estimates) were 0.52/0.18 for {\\lambda}4-10\nand 0.84/0.77 for {\\lambda}1 and {\\lambda}0.5. The intersession ICCs were\naround 0.60. The SEM results revealed that {\\lambda}0.5 measured in\nmedio-lateral direction exhibited the best reliability, sufficient to detect\nmoderate changes at individual level (20%). However, due to the low\nintersession repeatability, one should average several measurements taken on\ndifferent days in order to better approximate the true LDS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Oct 2013 08:39:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-17"}

The\nmass-metallicity relation at $z\\sim1.6$ is steeper than the relation observed\nin the local Universe. The steeper MZ relation at $z\\sim1.6$ is mainly due to\nevolution in the stellar mass where the MZ relation begins to turnover and\nflatten. This turnover mass is 1.2 dex larger at $z\\sim1.6$.

Indeed, time-dependent magnetized models of radiatively inefficient\naccretion flows (RIAFs), which are commonly used to explain the millimeter,\nnear-infrared, and X-ray emission of Sgr A*, often also produce jet-like\noutflows. However, the emission from these models has so far failed to\nreproduce the flat radio spectrum. Aims: We investigate whether current\naccretion simulations can produce the compact flat spectrum emission by simply\nusing a different prescription for the heating of the radiating particles in\nthe jet. Methods: We studied the radiative properties of accretion flows onto a\nblack hole produced in time-dependent general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic\n(GRMHD) simulations. A crucial free parameter in these models has always been\nthe electron temperature, and here we allowed for variations in the\nproton-to-electron temperature ratios in the jet and disk. Results: We found\nthat the flat spectrum is readily reproduced by a standard GRMHD model if one\nhas an almost isothermal jet coupled to a two-temperature accretion flow. The\nlow-frequency radio mission comes from the outflowing sheath of matter\nsurrounding the strongly magnetized nearly empty jet. The model is consistent\nwith the radio sizes and spectrum of Sgr A*. Conclusions: Hence, GRMHD models\nof accreting black holes can in principle naturally reproduce jets that match\nobserved characteristics. For Sgr A* the model fit to the spectrum predicts\nhigher mass-accretion rates when a jet is included than without a jet. Hence,\nthe impact of the recently discovered G2 cloud that is expected to be accreted\nonto Sgr A* might be less severe than currently thought.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Oct 2013 08:54:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

Although it is a simple model,\ncompression methods become necessary because datasets are increasingly larger\nand various scalability issues arise around their organization and storage.\nThis requirement is more restrictive in RDF stores because efficient SPARQL\nresolution on the compressed RDF datasets is also required.\n  This article introduces a novel RDF indexing technique (called k2-triples)\nsupporting efficient SPARQL resolution in compressed space. k2-triples, uses\nthe predicate to vertically partition the dataset into disjoint subsets of\npairs (subject, object), one per predicate. These subsets are represented as\nbinary matrices in which 1-bits mean that the corresponding triple exists in\nthe dataset. This model results in very sparse matrices, which are efficiently\ncompressed using k2-trees. We enhance this model with two compact indexes\nlisting the predicates related to each different subject and object, in order\nto address the specific weaknesses of vertically partitioned representations.\nThe resulting technique not only achieves by far the most compressed\nrepresentations, but also the best overall performance for RDF retrieval in our\nexperiments. Our approach uses up to 10 times less space than a state of the\nart baseline, and outperforms its performance by several order of magnitude on\nthe most basic query patterns. In addition, we optimize traditional join\nalgorithms on k2-triples and define a novel one leveraging its specific\nfeatures.

The role of the axial U(1) breaking Kobayashi-Maskawa-'t Hooft\ninteraction on the low-lying thermal excitations is examined. At low\ntemperatures, only mesonic correlations, mainly due to low mass mesonic\ncollective excitations, pions and kaons, dominate the pressure while thermal\nexcitations of quarks are suppressed by the Polyakov loop. As temperature\nincreases, kaons and pions melt into the continuum of quark and anti-quark\nexcitations successively so that hadronic phase changes continuously to the\nquark phase where quark excitations dominate pressure together with gluon\npressure coming from the effective potential for the Polyakov loop. Since we\nintroduce mesons as not elementary fields but auxiliary fields made from\nquarks, we can describe the phase transition between hadronic phase and quark\nphase in a unified fashion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Oct 2013 09:25:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-01"}

The local moments carried by Mn impurities doped into\nBa(Fe1-xCox)2As2(Co-122) and BaFe(As1-xPx)2(P-122) at optimal doping induce a\nspin polarization in the vicinity of the impurity. The amplitude, shape and\nextension of this polarisation is given by the real part of the susceptibility\nchi'(r) of FeAs layers, and is consequently related to the nature and strength\nof the electronic correlations present in the system. We study this\npolarisation using 75As NMR in Co-122 and both 75As and 31P NMR in P-122. The\nNMR spectra of Mn-doped materials is made of two essential features. First is a\nsatellite line associated with nuclei located as nearest neighbor of Mn\nimpurities. The analysis of the temperature dependence of the shift of this\nsatellite line shows that Mn local moments behave as isolated Curie moments.\nThe second feature is a temperature dependent broadening of the central line.\nWe show that the broadening of the central line follows the susceptibility of\nMn local moments, as expected from typical RKKY-like interactions. This\ndemonstrates that the susceptibility chi'(r) of FeAs layers does not make\nsignificant contribution to the temperature dependent broadening of the central\nline. chi'(r) is consequently only weakly temperature dependent in optimally\ndoped Co-122 and P-122. This behaviour is in contrast with that of strongly\ncorrelated materials such as underdoped cuprate high-Tc superconductors where\nthe central line broadens faster than the impurity susceptibility grows,\nbecause of the development of strong magnetic correlations when T is lowered.\nMoreover, the FeAs layer susceptibility is found quantitatively similar in both\nheterovalent doped and isolvalent doped BaFe2As2.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Oct 2013 10:58:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Oct 2013 13:00:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-24"}

The entire system, comprising\nnetworks of different nature, can be represented as a multi-layer network. In\nthis context, lexical innovations diffusion occurs in a peculiar fashion.

The combination of a high mass and a\nsmall radius, such as in white dwarfs, can lead to an enormous energy release\nin the BL, provided the WD rotates slowly.

In most of the cases, there are\nmultiple blocks of variables. However, the traditional alternating direction\nmethod (ADM) and its linearized version (LADM, obtained by linearizing the\nquadratic penalty term) are for the two-block case and cannot be naively\ngeneralized to solve the multi-block case. So there is great demand on\nextending the ADM based methods for the multi-block case. In this paper, we\npropose LADM with parallel splitting and adaptive penalty (LADMPSAP) to solve\nmulti-block separable convex programs efficiently. When all the component\nobjective functions have bounded subgradients, we obtain convergence results\nthat are stronger than those of ADM and LADM, e.g., allowing the penalty\nparameter to be unbounded and proving the sufficient and necessary conditions}\nfor global convergence. We further propose a simple optimality measure and\nreveal the convergence rate of LADMPSAP in an ergodic sense. For programs with\nextra convex set constraints, with refined parameter estimation we devise a\npractical version of LADMPSAP for faster convergence. Finally, we generalize\nLADMPSAP to handle programs with more difficult objective functions by\nlinearizing part of the objective function as well. LADMPSAP is particularly\nsuitable for sparse representation and low-rank recovery problems because its\nsubproblems have closed form solutions and the sparsity and low-rankness of the\niterates can be preserved during the iteration. It is also highly\nparallelizable and hence fits for parallel or distributed computing.

Recent measurements using the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect have\nshown that many (~ 50%) of these planets are misaligned; furthermore, some (~\n15%) are even retrograde with respect to the stellar spin axis. Motivated by\nthese observations, we explore the possibility of forming retrograde orbits in\nhierarchical triple configurations consisting of a star-planet inner pair with\nanother giant planet, or brown dwarf, in a much wider orbit. Recently Naoz et\nal. (2011) showed that in such a system, the inner planet's orbit can flip back\nand forth from prograde to retrograde, and can also reach extremely high\neccentricities. Here we map a significant part of the parameter space of\ndynamical outcomes for these systems. We derive strong constraints on the\norbital configurations for the outer perturber that could lead to the formation\nof hot Jupiters with misaligned or retrograde orbits. We focus only on the\nsecular evolution, neglecting other dynamical effects such as mean-motion\nresonances, as well as all dissipative forces. For example, with an inner\nJupiter-like planet initially on a nearly circular orbit at 5 AU, we show that\na misaligned hot Jupiter is likely to be formed in the presence of a more\nmassive planetary companion (> 2 MJ) within 140 AU of the inner system, with\nmutual inclination 50 degrees and eccentricity above 0.25. This is in striking\ncontrast to the test-particle approximation, where an almost perpendicular\nconfiguration can still cause large eccentricity excitations, but flips of an\ninner Jupiter-like planet are much less likely to occur. The constraints we\nderive can be used to guide future observations, and, in particular, searches\nfor more distant companions in systems containing a hot Jupiter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Oct 2013 15:03:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 30 Nov 2013 16:59:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}
