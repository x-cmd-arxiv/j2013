The labels\nof an edge indicate the discrete moments in time at which the edge is\navailable. We also consider temporal paths in a temporal graph, i.e. paths\nwhose edges are assigned a strictly increasing sequence of labels. Furthermore,\nwe assume the uniform case (UNI-CASE), in which every edge of a graph is\nassigned exactly one time label from a set of integers and the time labels\nassigned to the edges of the graph are chosen randomly and independently, with\nthe selection following the uniform distribution. We call uniform random\ntemporal graphs the graphs that satisfy the UNI-CASE. We begin by deriving the\nexpected number of temporal paths of a given length in the uniform random\ntemporal clique. We define the term temporal distance of two vertices, which is\nthe arrival time, i.e. the time-label of the last edge, of the temporal path\nthat connects those vertices, which has the smallest arrival time amongst all\ntemporal paths that connect those vertices. We then propose and study two\nstatistical properties of temporal graphs. One is the maximum expected temporal\ndistance which is, as the term indicates, the maximum of all expected temporal\ndistances in the graph. The other one is the temporal diameter which, loosely\nspeaking, is the expectation of the maximum temporal distance in the graph. We\nderive the maximum expected temporal distance of a uniform random temporal star\ngraph as well as an upper bound on both the maximum expected temporal distance\nand the temporal diameter of the normalized version of the uniform random\ntemporal clique, in which the largest time-label available equals the number of\nvertices. Finally, we provide an algorithm that solves an optimization problem\non a specific type of temporal (multi)graphs of two vertices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Oct 2013 17:58:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-30"}

This problem is a consequence of an oversimplified modeling of the\nbinary's physics in the initial data. Since junk radiation is not\nastrophysically realistic, it contaminates the actual waveforms of interest and\nposes a numerical nuisance. The work here presents a further step towards\nmitigating and understanding the origin of this issue, by incorporating\npost-Newtonian results in the construction of constraint-satisfying binary\nblack-hole initial data. Here we focus on including realistic tidal\ndeformations of the black holes in the initial data, by building on the method\nof superposing suitably chosen black hole metrics to compute the conformal\ndata. We describe the details of our initial data for an equal-mass and\nnonspinning binary, compute the subsequent relaxation of horizon quantities in\nevolutions, and quantify the amount of junk radiation that is generated. These\nresults are contrasted with those obtained with the most common choice of\nconformally flat (CF) initial data, as well as superposed Kerr-Schild (SKS)\ninitial data. We find that when realistic tidal deformations are included, the\nearly transients in the horizon geometries are significantly reduced, along\nwith smaller deviations in the relaxed black hole masses and spins from their\nstarting values. Likewise, the junk radiation content in the $l=2$ modes is\nreduced by a factor of $\\sim$1.7 relative to CF initial data, but only by a\nfactor of $\\sim$1.2 relative to SKS initial data. More prominently, the junk\nradiation content in the $3\\leq l\\leq8$ modes is reduced by a factor of $\\sim$5\nrelative to CF initial data, and by a factor of $\\sim$2.4 relative to SKS\ninitial data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Oct 2013 18:01:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Nov 2013 09:15:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-02"}

A paper at Financial\nCryptography 2012 conference explains that it is a system which \"uses no fancy\ncryptography\", and is \"by no means perfect\". It depends on a well-known\ncryptographic standard SHA-256. In this paper we revisit the cryptographic\nprocess which allows one to make money by producing bitcoins. We reformulate\nthis problem as a Constrained Input Small Output (CISO) hashing problem and\nreduce the problem to a pure block cipher problem. We estimate the speed of\nthis process and we show that the cost of this process is less than it seems\nand it depends on a certain cryptographic constant which we estimated to be at\nmost 1.86.

In a sense,\ntwisted 5d SYM might be regarded as a \"Lagrangian\" for class S theories on\nR^{1,2} times S^1. First, we show that twisted 5d SYM gives generalized\nHitchin's equations which was proposed recently. Then, we discuss how to\nidentify chiral operators with quantities in twisted 5d SYM. Mesons, or\nholomorphic moment maps, are identified with operators at punctures which are\nrealized as 3d superconformal theories T_rho[G] coupled to twisted 5d SYM.\n\"Baryons\" are identified qualitatively through a study of 4d N=2 Higgs\nbranches.

Thanks to their large mean free path,\nX-rays are capable of preionizing and preheating the gas in the intergalactic\nmedium (IGM) and in haloes long before the reionization of the Universe is\ncomplete, and thus could have strongly affected the formation of subsequent\ngenerations of stars as well as reionization. We have carried out zoomed\nhydrodynamical cosmological simulations of minihaloes, accounting for the\nformation of Pop III stars and their collapse into BHs and HMXBs, and the\nassociated radiation-hydrodynamic feedback from UV and X-ray photons. We find\nno strong net feedback from HMXBs on the simulated star formation history. On\nthe other hand, the preheating of the IGM by HMXBs leads to a strong\nsuppression of small-scale structures and significantly lowers the\nrecombination rate in the IGM, thus yielding a net positive feedback on\nreionization. We further show that X-ray feedback from HMXBs can augment the\nionizing feedback from the Pop III progenitor stars to suppress gas accretion\nonto the first BHs, limiting their growth into supermassive BHs. Finally, we\nshow that X-ray ionization by HMXBs leaves distinct signatures in the\nproperties of the high-redshift hydrogen that may be probed in upcoming\nobservations of the redshifted 21cm spin-flip line.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Oct 2013 20:00:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 12 Mar 2014 01:10:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-11"}

Models with early enrichment predict a uniform metal\ndistribution at large radii in clusters, while late-time enrichment, favored by\nsome previous studies, is expected to introduce significant spatial variations\nof the metallicity. To discriminate clearly between these competing models, it\nis essential to test for potential inhomogeneities by measuring the abundances\nout to large radii along multiple directions in clusters, which has not\nhitherto been done.

Observations of transiting systems, which\nallow us to directly measure planet masses and radii and constrain atmospheric\nproperties, are key to understanding the compositional diversity of the planets\nin this mass range. Although Kepler has discovered hundreds of transiting\nsuper-Earth candidates over the past four years, the majority of these planets\norbit stars that are too far away and too faint to allow for detailed\natmospheric characterization and reliable mass estimates. Ground-based transit\nsurveys focus on much brighter stars, but most lack the sensitivity to detect\nplanets in this size range.

From\nsuch an analysis, it is conceivable that double fertilization can drive\nangiosperm evolution by facilitating crosses between genetically diverse\nparents. A key feature of this ability is the order of cell division following\ndouble fertilization, since division of the primary endosperm nucleus prior to\nthe zygote would produce small RNA capable of identifying TEs and defining\nchromatin states in the zygote prior to its entry into S-phase of the cell\ncycle. Consequently, crosses leading to increased ploidy or between genetically\ndiverse parents would yield offspring better capable of managing a diverse\ncomplement of TEs and repetitive DNA.

However, many\nof its features are poorly understood. In particular, analytic relations to\nother key macroscopic properties of jammed matter, such as the contact network\nand its coordination number, are still lacking. Here we develop a mean-field\ntheory for this problem, based on the consideration of the contact network as a\nrandom graph where the force transmission becomes a constraint optimization\nproblem. We can thus use the cavity method developed in the last decades within\nthe statistical physics of spin glasses and hard computer science problems.\nThis method allows us to compute the force distribution $\\text P(f)$ for random\npackings of hard particles of any shape, with or without friction. We find a\nnew signature of jamming in the small force behavior $\\text P(f) \\sim\nf^{\\theta}$, whose exponent has attracted recent active interest: we find a\nfinite value for $\\text P(f=0)$, along with $\\theta=0$. Furthermore, we relate\nthe force distribution to a lower bound of the average coordination number $\\,\n{\\bar z}_{\\rm c}^{\\rm min}(\\mu)$ of jammed packings of frictional spheres with\ncoefficient $\\mu$. This bridges the gap between the two known isostatic limits\n$\\, {\\bar z}_{\\rm c}(\\mu=0)=2D$ (in dimension $D$) and $\\, {\\bar z}_{\\rm c}(\\mu\n\\to \\infty)=D+1$ by extending the naive Maxwell's counting argument to\nfrictional spheres. The theoretical framework describes different types of\nsystems, such as non-spherical objects in arbitrary dimensions, providing a\ncommon mean-field scenario to investigate force transmission, contact networks\nand coordination numbers of jammed disordered packings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Oct 2013 21:40:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Jun 2014 18:43:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-15"}

The solution without sidewalls is a simple\ngeneralisation of that found by Robison (JFM, 648, 363), allowing us to obtain\nthe equilibrium grounding line thickness using a simple computer model and to\nget an analytic approximation.

For a long time,\nhowever, it has been difficult to realize Anderson's original vision in such\nsolvable models, according to which the ground state has an unbroken SU(2) spin\nrotational symmetry and is dominated by fluctuation of singlet bonds. The\nkagome lattice is the simplest lattice geometry for which parent Hamiltonians\nstabilizing a prototypical spin-1/2 short-ranged RVB wave function has been\nconstructed and strong evidence has been given that this state belongs to a\ntopological phase.

For example, the\nmolecular-weight distribution influences polymeric- semiconductor properties\nvia diverse microstructures; polymers of low weight-average molecular weight\n(Mw) form unconnected, extended-chain crystals, usually of a paraffinic\nstructure. Because of the non-entangled nature of the relatively short-chain\nmacromolecules, this leads to a polycrystalline, one-phase morphology. In\ncontrast, with high-Mw materials, where average chain lengths are longer than\nthe length between entanglements, two-phase morphologies, comprised of\ncrystalline moieties embedded in largely unordered (amorphous) regions, are\nobtained. We investigate charge photogeneration processes in neat regioregular\npoly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) of varying Mw by means of time-resolved\nphotoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. At 10 K, PL originating from recombination\nof long-lived charge pairs decays over microsecond timescales. Both the\namplitude and decay rate distribution depend strongly on Mw. In films with\ndominant one-phase chain-extended microstructures, the delayed PL is suppressed\nas a result of a diminished yield of photoinduced charges, and its decay is\nsignificantly faster than in two-phase microstructures. However, independent of\nMw, charge recombination regenerates singlet excitons in torsionally disordered\nchains forming more strongly coupled photophysical aggregates than those in the\nsteady-state ensemble, with delayed PL lineshape reminiscent of that in\nparaffinic morphologies at steady state.

In recent years it has become clear that quiescent\nprominences support small-amplitude transverse oscillations, however, sample\nsizes are usually too small for general conclusions to be drawn. We remedy this\nby providing a statistical study of transverse oscillations in vertical\nprominence threads. Over a three-hour period of observations it was possible to\nmeasure the properties of 3436 waves, finding periods from 50 to 6000 s with\ntypical velocity amplitudes ranging between 0.2 to 23 km s$^{-1}$. The large\nnumber of observed waves allows the determination of the frequency dependence\nof the wave properties and derivation of the velocity power spectrum for the\ntransverse waves. For frequencies less than 7 mHz, the frequency-dependence of\nthe velocity power is consistent with the velocity power spectra generated from\nobservations of the horizontal motions of magnetic elements in the photosphere,\nsuggesting that the prominence transverse waves are driven by photospheric\nmotions. However, at higher frequencies the two distributions significantly\ndiverge, with relatively more power found at higher frequencies in the\nprominence oscillations. These results highlight that waves over a large\nfrequency range are ubiquitous in prominences, and that a significant amount of\nthe wave energy is found at higher frequency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Oct 2013 03:17:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

Five water maser sources were detected, and\nthey are excited by HH 1-2 VLA 3, HH 1-2 VLA 1, L1641N MM1/3, NGC 2071 IRS 1/3,\nand an object in the OMC 3 region. The water masers showed significant\nvariability in intensity and velocity with time scales of a month or shorter.\nFour methanol emission sources were detected, and those in the OMC 2 FIR 3/4\nand L1641N MM1/3 regions are probably masers. The methanol emission from the\nother two sources in the NGC 2071 IRS 1-3 and V380 Ori NE regions are probably\nthermal. For the water masers, the number of detections per protostar in the\nsurvey region is about 2%, which suggests that the water masers of low-mass\nprotostars are rarely detectable. The methanol class I maser of low-mass\nprotostars is an even rarer phenomenon, with a detection rate much smaller than\n1%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Oct 2013 05:31:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

By combining the results of this survey with Very Large Array\nobservations at higher frequencies from the literature, spectra were derived\nand a free-free absorption model was fitted of 20 known sources in NGC 253.

A star formation rate of SFR(M>5\nM_solar)<4.9 M_solar per yr was also estimated using the standard relation\nbetween supernova and star-formation rates.

We focus on a spatially closed brane that bounds the\ninterior four-ball of the bulk space. The background cosmological evolution on\nthe brane is now described by the normal branch, and the boundary conditions in\nthe bulk become the regularity conditions for the metric everywhere inside the\nfour-ball. In this approach, there is no spatial infinity or any other boundary\nin the bulk space since the spatial section is compact, hence, we term this\nsetup as a no-boundary proposal. Assuming that the bulk cosmological constant\nis absent and employing the Mukohyama master variable, we argue that the\neffects of nonlocality on brane perturbations may be ignored if the brane is\nmarginally closed. In this case, there arises a relation that closes the system\nof equations for perturbations on the brane. Perturbations of pressureless\nmatter and dark radiation can now be described by a system of coupled\nsecond-order differential equations. Remarkably, this system can be exactly\nsolved in the matter-dominated and de Sitter regimes. In this case, apart from\nthe usual growing and decaying modes, we find two additional modes that behave\nmonotonically on super-Hubble spatial scales and exhibit rapid oscillations\nwith decaying amplitude on sub-Hubble spatial scales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Oct 2013 07:23:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-23"}

For graphene with Anderson\ndisorder, localization lengths of quasi-one-dimensional systems with various\ndisorder strengths, edge symmetries, and boundary conditions are calculated\nusing the real-space Kubo-Greenwood formalism, showing excellent agreement with\nindependent transfer matrix calculations and superior computational efficiency.\nUsing these data, we demonstrate the applicability of the one-parameter scaling\ntheory of localization length and propose an analytical expression for the\nscaling function, which provides a reliable method of computing the\ntwo-dimensional localization length. This method is found to be consistent with\nanother widely used method which relates the two-dimensional localization\nlength to the elastic mean free path and the semiclassical conductivity.\nAbnormal behavior at the charge neutrality point is identified and interpreted\nto be caused by finite-size effects when the system width is comparable to or\nsmaller than the elastic mean free path. We also demonstrate the finite-size\neffect when calculating the two-dimensional conductivity in the localized\nregime and show that a renormalization group beta function consistent with the\none-parameter scaling theory can be extracted numerically. For graphene with\nvacancy disorder, we show that the proposed scaling function of localization\nlength also applies. Lastly, we discuss some ambiguities in calculating the\nsemiclassical conductivity around the charge neutrality point due to the\npresence of resonant states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Oct 2013 09:01:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Apr 2014 13:40:03 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 30 Jun 2014 11:18:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-01"}

We detected submillimeter rotational transitions of 12CO, 13CO, HCN, CN\nand HCO+ from the T Cha disk. The 12CO line appears to display a double-peaked\nline profile indicative of Keplerian rotation.

In this\npaper, we address this question through an analysis of the particular case of\nNGC 6809. While previous studies have performed dynamical modeling of this\nglobular cluster using a small number of available kinematic data, they did not\nperform appropriate statistical inference tests for the choice of best model\ndescription; such statistical inference for model selection is important since,\nin general, different models can result in significantly different inferred\nquantities. With the latest kinematic data, we use Bayesian inference tests for\nmodel selection and thus obtain the best fitting models, as well as mass and\ndynamic mass-to-light ratio estimates. For this, we introduce a new likelihood\nfunction that provides more constrained distributions for the defining\nparameters of dynamical models. Initially we consider models with a known\ndistribution function, and then model the cluster using solutions of the\nspherically symmetric Jeans equation; this latter approach depends upon the\nmass density profile and anisotropy $\\beta$ parameter. In order to find the\nbest description for the cluster we compare these models by calculating their\nBayesian evidence.

These\njets are believed to be important for the coronal heating and the acceleration\nof the fast solar wind. We studied the dynamics of two jets seen in a polar\ncoronal hole with a combination of imaging from EIS and XRT onboard Hinode. We\nobserved drift motions related to the evolution and formation of these\nsmall-scale jets, which we tried to model as well. We found observational\nevidence that supports the idea that polar jets are very likely produced by\nmultiple small-scale reconnections occurring at different times in different\nlocations. These eject plasma blobs that flow up and down with a motion very\nsimilar to a simple ballistic motion. The associated drift speed of the first\njet is estimated to be $\\approx$ 27 km s$^{-1}$. The average outward speed of\nthe first jet is $\\approx 171$ km s$^{-1}$, well below the escape speed, hence\nif simple ballistic motion is considered, the plasma will not escape the Sun.\nThe second jet was observed in the south polar coronal hole with three XRT\nfilters, namely, C$_{-}$poly, Al$_{-}$poly, and Al$_{-}$mesh filters. We\nobserved that the second jet drifted at all altitudes along the jet with the\nsame drift speed of $\\simeq$ 7 km s$^{-1}$. The enhancement in the light curves\nof low-temperature EIS lines in the later phase of the jet lifetime and the\nshape of the jet's stack plots suggests that the jet material is falls back,\nand most likely cools down. To support this conclusion, the observed drifts\nwere interpreted within a scenario where reconnection progressively shifts\nalong a magnetic structure, leading to the sequential appearance of jets of\nabout the same size and physical characteristics. On this basis, we also\npropose a simple qualitative model that mimics the observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Oct 2013 11:26:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-31"}

It was\nfirst observed in computer simulations of the causal dynamical triangulation\n(CDT) approach to quantum gravity and refers to the reduction of the spectral\ndimension from 4 at classical scales to 2 at short distances. Thereafter\nseveral authors confirmed a similar result from different approaches to quantum\ngravity. Despite the contribution from different approaches, no analytical\nmodel was proposed to explain the numerical results as the continuum limit of\nCDT. In this thesis we introduce graph ensembles as toy models of CDT and show\nthat both the continuum limit and a scale dependent spectral dimension can be\ndefined rigorously. First we focus on a simple graph ensemble, the random comb.\nIt does not have any dynamics from the gravity point of view, but serves as an\ninstructive toy model to introduce the characteristic scale of the graph, study\nthe continuum limit and define the scale dependent spectral dimension. Having\ndefined the continuum limit, we study the reduction of the spectral dimension\non more realistic toy models, the multigraph ensembles, which serve as a radial\napproximation of CDT. We focus on the (recurrent) multigraph approximation of\nthe two-dimensional CDT whose ensemble measure is analytically controlled. The\nlatter comes from the critical Galton-Watson process conditioned on\nnon-extinction. Next we turn our attention to transient multigraph ensembles,\ncorresponding to higher-dimensional CDT. Firstly we study their fractal\nproperties and secondly calculate the scale dependent spectral dimension and\ncompare it to computer simulations. We comment further on the relation between\nHorava-Lifshitz gravity, asymptotic safety, multifractional spacetimes and\nCDT-like models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Oct 2013 11:54:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-31"}

We seek for a\nquantitative and systematic connection between the impossibility to converge\nself-consistent calculations of nuclei and the occurrence of finite-size\ninstabilities in SNM for the example of scalar-isovector (S=0, T=1)\ninstabilities of the standard Skyrme EDF.

Tuning the coupling constant $C^{\\rho\n\\Delta\\rho}_{1}$ of the gradient term that triggers scalar-isovector\ninstabilities of the standard Skyrme EDF, we find that the occurrence of\ninstabilities in finite nuclei depends strongly on the numerical scheme used to\nsolve the self-consistent mean-field equations.

This paper provides new results along this\nresearch line and presents new algorithms for performing minimal model finding\nand checking over positive propositional CNFs and model minimization over\npropositional CNFs. An algorithmic schema, called the Generalized Elimination\nAlgorithm (GEA) is presented, that computes a minimal model of any positive\nCNF. The schema generalizes the Elimination Algorithm (EA) [BP97], which\ncomputes a minimal model of positive head-cycle-free (HCF) CNF theories. While\nthe EA always runs in polynomial time in the size of the input HCF CNF, the\ncomplexity of the GEA depends on the complexity of the specific eliminating\noperator invoked therein, which may in general turn out to be exponential.\nTherefore, a specific eliminating operator is defined by which the GEA\ncomputes, in polynomial time, a minimal model for a class of CNF that strictly\nincludes head-elementary-set-free (HEF) CNF theories [GLL06], which form, in\ntheir turn, a strict superset of HCF theories. Furthermore, in order to deal\nwith the high complexity associated with recognizing HEF theories, an\n\"incomplete\" variant of the GEA (called IGEA) is proposed: the resulting\nschema, once instantiated with an appropriate elimination operator, always\nconstructs a model of the input CNF, which is guaranteed to be minimal if the\ninput theory is HEF.

Data modelling is\ntypically restricted to either the analysis of monotonic trends in individual\nwells, or independent fitting of spatial concentration distributions (e.g.\nKriging) to separate monitoring time periods. Neither of these techniques\nsatisfactorily elucidate the interaction between spatial and temporal\ncomponents of the data. Potential negative consequences include an incomplete\nunderstanding of groundwater plume dynamics, which can lead to the selection of\ninappropriate remedial strategies. The GroundWater Spatiotemporal Data Analysis\nTool (GWSDAT) is a user friendly, open source, decision support tool that has\nbeen developed to address these issues. Uniquely, GWSDAT applies a\nspatiotemporal model for a more coherent and smooth interpretation of the\ninteraction in spatial and time-series components of groundwater solute\nconcentrations. GWSDAT has been designed to work with standard groundwater\nmonitoring data sets, and has no special data requirements. Data entry is via a\nstandardised Microsoft Excel input template.

The numerical method is based on\nan implicit large-eddy simulation approach designed to capture effects from\nnon-resolved small scales. We obtain two regimes of differential rotation, with\nequatorial zonal flows accelerated either in the direction of rotation\n(solar-like) or in the opposite direction (anti-solar). While the models with\nthe solar-like differential rotation tend to produce multiple cells of\nmeridional circulation, the models with anti-solar differential rotation result\nin only one or two meridional cells. Our simulations indicate that the rotation\nand large-scale flow patterns critically depend on the ratio between buoyancy\nand Coriolis forces. By including a subadiabatic layer at the bottom of the\ndomain, corresponding to the stratification of a radiative zone, we reproduce a\nlayer of strong radial shear similar to the solar tachocline. Similarly,\nenhanced superadiabaticity at the top results in a near-surface shear layer\nlocated mainly at lower latitudes. The models reveal a latitudinal entropy\ngradient localized at the base of the convection zone and in the stable region,\nwhich however does not propagate across the convection zone. In consequence,\nbaroclinicity effects remain small and the rotation iso-contours align in\ncylinders along the rotation axis. Our results confirm the alignment of large\nconvective cells along the rotation axis in the deep convection zone, and\nsuggest that such \"banana-cell\" pattern can be hidden beneath the\nsupergranulation layer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Oct 2013 14:50:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-10"}

With the\nmolasses loaded from thermal vapor and an averaging time of 65 h, we measure\nthe frequency of the Yb+ transition with a relative statistical uncertainty of\n$2.8\\times10^{-16}$ and a systematic uncertainty of $5.9\\times10^{-16}$. The\nfrequency was also simultaneously measured with the second fountain that uses a\nquartz-based interrogation oscillator. The unperturbed frequency of the Yb+\ntransition is realized with an uncertainty of $1.1\\times10^{-16}$ that mainly\nresults from the uncertainty of the blackbody shift at the operating\ntemperature near 300 K. The transition frequency of 688 358 979 309 307.82(36)\nHz, measured with the two fountains, is in good agreement with previous\nresults.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Oct 2013 15:11:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-21"}

The\nnewly available multifield capability of the VLBA makes it possible for us to\ninspect of order 100 sources per hour of observing time with a 6.75 sigma\ndetection sensitivity of approximately 1 mJy/beam. The results of the mJIVE-20\nsurvey are made publicly available as soon as the data are calibrated. After 18\nmonths of observing, over 20,000 FIRST sources have been inspected, with 4,336\nVLBI detections. These initial results suggest that within the range 1 - 200\nmJy, fainter sources are somewhat more likely to be dominated by a very compact\ncomponent than brighter sources. Over half of all arcsecond-scale mJy radio\nsources contain a compact component, although the fraction of sources which are\ndominated by milliarcsecond scale structure is smaller at 30-35%, increasing\ntowards lower flux densities. Significant differences are seen depending on the\noptical classification of the source. Radio sources with a stellar/point-like\ncounterpart in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) are more likely to be\ndetected overall, but this detection likelihood appears to be independent of\nthe arcsecond-scale radio flux density; the trend towards higher radio\ncompactness for fainter sources is confined to SDSS galaxies and\nnon-detections. These results are consistent with a unification model of AGN in\nwhich less luminous sources have on average slower radio jets, with lower\nDoppler suppression of compact core emission over a wider range of viewing\nangles.

Likewise, the dipole component alone provides an adequate\napproximation of the disc truncation radius.

To follow the\nquasi-static evolution of the coronal magnetic field, we reconstruct a time\nsequence of static fields using a recently developed nonlinear force-free field\nmodel constrained by the SDO/HMI vector magnetograms. A detailed analysis of\nthe fields compared with the SDO/AIA observations suggests the following\nscenario for the evolution of the region. Initially, a new bipole emerges into\nthe negative polarity of a pre-existing bipolar AR, forming a null point\ntopology between the two flux systems. A weakly twisted flux rope (FR) is then\nbuilt up slowly in the embedded core region, largely through flux-cancellation\nphotospheric reconnections, forming a bald patch separatrix surface (BPSS)\nseparating the FR from its ambient field. The FR grows gradually until its axis\nruns into a torus instability (TI) domain near the end of the third day, and\nthe BPSS also develops a fully S-shape. Unlike in the case of standard TI, the\nFR does not erupt instantly since it is still attached at the photosphere along\nthe bald patch (BP) portion of the polarity inversion line. The combined\neffects of the TI-driven expansion of the FR and the line-tying at the BP tear\nthe FR into two parts with the upper portion freely expelled and the lower\nportion remaining behind the post-flare arcades. This process dynamically\nperturbs the BPSS and results in the transient enhanced brightening of the\nsigmoid. The accelerated expansion of the upper portion of the FR strongly\npushes its envelope flux near the null point and triggers breakout reconnection\nat the null, as evidenced by a remarkable circular flare ribbon, which further\nfacilitates the eruption. We discuss the important implications of these\nresults for the formation and disruption of sigmoid region with FR.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Oct 2013 15:25:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

We plotted the distribution of energy\nin solar surface by analyzing the solar image with scalograms and\n3D-coefficient plots.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Oct 2013 10:37:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Dec 2013 16:40:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-11"}
