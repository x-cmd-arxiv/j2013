By performing Brownian dynamics simulations of glassy\nsystems consisting of mixtures of active and passive hard spheres, we show that\nthe crystallization of such hard-sphere glasses can be dramatically promoted by\ndoping the system with small amounts of active particles.

At the cut-off\nmagnitude m of on-going and planned major weak lensing surveys, the logarithmic\nslope of the cumulative number counts s = dlog[n(>m)]/dlog(m) is in the range\n0.1 < s < 0.5.

In particular, w derived from the power spectrum is less affected than w\nderived from peak counts, while the opposite is true for the best-constrained\ncombination of [sigma_8 Omega_m^gamma] (with gamma=0.62 from the power spectrum\nand gamma = 0.48 from peak counts).

For example, it can be leveraged to facilitate efficient city\nplanning and improve prevention strategies when faced with epidemics. The\nnewfound wealth of rich sources of data---including banknote flows, mobile\nphone records, and transportation data---has led to an explosion of attempts to\ncharacterize modern human mobility. Unfortunately, the dearth of comparable\nhistorical data makes it much more difficult to study human mobility patterns\nfrom the past. In this paper, we present an analysis of long-term human\nmigration, which is important for processes such as urbanization and the spread\nof ideas. We demonstrate that the data record from Korean family books (called\n\"jokbo\") can be used to estimate migration patterns via marriages from the past\n750 years. We apply two generative models of long-term human mobility to\nquantify the relevance of geographical information to human marriage records in\nthe data, and we find that the wide variety in the geographical distributions\nof the clans poses interesting challenges for the direct application of these\nmodels. Using the different geographical distributions of clans, we quantify\nthe \"ergodicity\" of clans in terms of how widely and uniformly they have spread\nacross Korea, and we compare these results to those obtained using surname data\nfrom the Czech Republic. To examine population flow in more detail, we also\nconstruct and examine a population-flow network between regions. Based on the\ncorrelation between ergodicity and migration in Korea, we identify two\ndifferent types of migration patterns: diffusive and convective. We expect the\nanalysis of diffusive versus convective effects in population flows to be\nwidely applicable to the study of mobility and migration patterns across\ndifferent cultures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Oct 2013 18:56:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 27 May 2014 10:19:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 14 Aug 2014 02:16:08 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 16 Oct 2014 16:55:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-17"}

The full Fermi surface is described by a direct sum of chiral patch\ntheories, which are decoupled from each other in the low energy limit. Each\npatch includes low energy excitations near a set of points on the Fermi surface\nwith a common tangent vector. General patch theories are classified by the\nlocal shape of the Fermi surface, the dispersion of the critical boson, and the\nsymmetry group, which form the data for distinct universality classes. We prove\nthat a large class of chiral non-Fermi liquid states exist as stable critical\nstates of matter. For this, we use a renormalization group scheme where low\nenergy excitations of the Fermi surface are interpreted as a collection of\n(1+1)-dimensional chiral fermions with a continuous flavor labelling the\nmomentum along the Fermi surface. Due to chirality, the Wilsonian effective\naction is strictly UV finite. This allows one to extract the exact scaling\nexponents although the theories flow to strongly interacting field theories at\nlow energies. In general, the low energy effective theory of the full Fermi\nsurface includes patch theories of more than one universality classes. As a\nresult, physical responses include multiple universal components at low\ntemperatures. We also point out that, in quantum field theories with extended\nFermi surface, a non-commutative structure naturally emerges between a\ncoordinate and a momentum which are orthogonal to each other. We show that the\ninvalidity of patch description for Fermi liquid states is tied with the\npresence of UV/IR mixing associated with the emergent non-commutativity.

The quark\npropagators are dressed with the same kernel that describes the interaction\nbetween different quarks. We show that these equations are charge-conjugation\ninvariant, and that in the chiral limit of vanishing bare quark mass, a\nmassless pseudoscalar bound state is produced in a Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL)\nmechanism, which is associated with the Goldstone boson of spontaneous chiral\nsymmetry breaking. In this introductory paper, we test the formalism by using a\nsimplified kernel consisting of a momentum-space delta-function with a vector\nLorentz structure, to which one adds a mixed scalar and vector confining\ninteraction. The scalar part of the confining interaction is not chirally\ninvariant by itself, but decouples from the equations in the chiral limit and\ntherefore allows the NJL mechanism to work. With this model we calculate the\nquark mass function, and we compare our Minkowski-space results to lattice QCD\ndata obtained in Euclidean space. In a companion paper, we apply this formalism\nto a calculation of the pion form factor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Oct 2013 19:27:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Oct 2013 16:16:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 8 Jan 2014 14:38:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-09"}

In this paper,\nwe apply and adapt the recently proposed definitions of multipartite\nnonlocality [Phys. Rev.

Thus, when seen\nfrom the perspective of biseparable one-way classical signaling resources,\ncertain tripartite quantum correlations do not admit a definite causal order.\nIn the four- partite scenario, we obtain a superset description of the set of\nbiseparable correlations which can be produced by allowing two groups of\nbipartite non-signaling resources. Quantum violation of the resulting Bell-like\ninequalities are investigated. As a byproduct, we obtain some new examples of\ndevice-independent witnesses for genuine four-partite entanglement, and also\ndevice-independent witnesses that allows one to infer the structure of the\nunderlying multipartite entanglement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Oct 2013 20:01:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-27"}

The genus expansion and expansion\nthrough Vassiliev invariants explicitly demonstrate this phenomenon. In the\npresent letter we claim that the superpolynomials are not functions of such a\ntype: symmetric group characters do not provide an adequate linear basis for\ntheir expansions.

Applying this trick to\nthe genus and Vassiliev expansions, we observe that the deformation is fully\nstraightforward only for the thin knots.

This can suggest that the superpolynomials do in fact contain more\ninformation about knots than the colored HOMFLY and Kauffman polynomials.\nHowever, even for the thin knots the beta-deformation is non-innocent: already\nin the simplest examples it seems inconsistent with the postivity of colored\nsuperpolynomials in non-(anti)symmetric representations, which also happens in\nI.Cherednik's (DAHA-based) approach to the torus knots.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Oct 2013 20:56:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 Sep 2014 19:07:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-25"}

The following rigorous analytic results are obtained for the three\nproposals: (i) entropy grows when the density growing mode is dominant, (ii)\nall ever-expanding hyperbolic models reach a stable terminal equilibrium\ncharacterized by an inhomogeneous entropy maximum in their late time evolution;\n(iii) regions with decaying modes and collapsing elliptic models exhibit\nunstable equilibria associated with an entropy minimum (iv) near singularities\nthe CET entropy diverges while the HB entropies converge; (v) the CET entropy\nconverges for all models in the radial asymptotic range, whereas the HB\nentropies only converge for models asymptotic to an FLRW background. The fact\nthat different independent proposals yield fairly similar conditions for\nentropy production, time evolution and radial scaling in generic LTB models\nseems to suggest that their common notion of a \"gravitational entropy\" may be a\ntheoretically robust concept applicable to more general spacetimes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Oct 2013 21:53:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 Mar 2014 04:51:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

In recent years, several studies\ninvestigated the effects of noise on Turing patterns and showed that the\nparameter regimes, for which stochastic Turing patterns are observed, can be\nlarger than the parameter regimes predicted by deterministic models, which are\nwritten in terms of partial differential equations for species concentrations.\nA common stochastic reaction-diffusion approach is written in terms of\ncompartment-based (lattice-based) models, where the domain of interest is\ndivided into artificial compartments and the number of molecules in each\ncompartment is simulated. In this paper, the dependence of stochastic Turing\npatterns on the compartment size is investigated. It has previously been shown\n(for relatively simpler systems) that a modeller should not choose compartment\nsizes which are too small or too large, and that the optimal compartment size\ndepends on the diffusion constant. Taking these results into account, we\npropose and study a compartment-based model of Turing patterns where each\nchemical species is described using a different set of compartments. It is\nshown that the parameter regions where spatial patterns form are different from\nthe regions obtained by classical deterministic PDE-based models, but they are\nalso different from the results obtained for the stochastic reaction-diffusion\nmodels which use a single set of compartments for all chemical species. In\nparticular, it is argued that some previously reported results on the effect of\nnoise on Turing patterns in biological systems need to be reinterpreted.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Oct 2013 21:56:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-30"}

In addition,\nthe average shape of the X-ray spectrum is an important input into X-ray\nbackground synthesis models.

The 15-55 keV LF measured by Swift-BAT is assumed to be the\nbest determination of the local LF, and then a spectral model is varied to\ndetermine the best fit to the 0.5-2 keV, 2-10 keV, 3-20 keV and 14-195 keV LFs.\nThe spectral model consists of a Gaussian distribution of power-laws with a\nmean photon-index <\\Gamma> and cutoff energy E_cut, as well as contributions\nfrom distant and disc reflection. The reflection strength is parameterised by\nvarying the Fe abundance relative to solar, A_Fe, and requiring a specific Fe K\nequivalent width (EW). In this way, the presence of the X-ray Baldwin effect\ncan be tested. The spectral model that best fits the four LFs has <\\Gamma> =\n1.85 \\pm 0.15, E_cut=270^{+170}_{-80} keV, A_Fe=0.3^{+0.3}_{-0.15} (90% C.L.).\nThe sub-solar A_Fe indicates the presence of strong reflection given the\nassumed Fe K EW. Indeed, parameterising the reflection strength with the R\nparameter gives R=1.7^{+1.7}_{-0.85}. There is moderate evidence for no X-ray\nBaldwin effect. A critical result of our procedure is that the shape of the\nlocal 2-10 keV LF measured by HEAO-1 and MAXI is incompatible with the LFs\nmeasured in the hard X-rays by Swift-BAT and RXTE. We therefore present a new\ndetermination of the local 2-10 keV LF that is consistent with all other energy\nbands.This new LF should be used to revise current measurements of the evolving\nAGN LF in the 2-10 keV band.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Oct 2013 22:39:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

That is, they show a shifted frequency distribution,\nwith one member of the pair peaking at a slightly lower frequency than the\nother. To illustrate the phenomenon, we analyze EEG spatio-spectral patterns\nproviding examples of dissociations in the 10Hz frequency band. Our\nobservations suggest that homologous pairs of neuromarkers have distinct\nintrinsic frequencies and only transiently coordinate their oscillations into\nsynchronous ensembles. On occasion, hemi-lateralized pairs are observed to\nblend into medial aggregates, leading to strongly coherent dynamics. We\nhypothesize that spectral dissociation plays a role in the balance of\nintegration and segregation in the brain: separation of oscillations from\nhomologous cortical areas allows them to function independently under certain\ncircumstances, while preserving a potential for stronger interactions supported\nby structural and functional symmetries.

The\nneed for real-time analysis of such large graph streams has led to progress on\nlow memory, one-pass streaming graph algorithms. These algorithms were designed\nfor simple graphs, assuming an edge is not repeated in the stream. Real graph\nstreams however, are almost always multigraphs i.e., they contain many\nduplicate edges. The assumption of no repeated edges requires an extra pass\n*storing all the edges* just for deduplication, which defeats the purpose of\nsmall memory algorithms.\n  We describe an algorithm for estimating the triangle count of a multigraph\nstream of edges. We show that all previous streaming algorithms for triangle\ncounting fail for multigraph streams, despite their impressive accuracies for\nsimple graphs. The bias created by duplicate edges is a major problem, and\nleads these algorithms astray. Our algorithm avoids these biases through\ncareful debiasing strategies and has provable theoretical guarantees and\nexcellent empirical performance. Our algorithm builds on the previously\nintroduced wedge sampling methodology.\n  Another challenge in analyzing temporal graphs is finding the right temporal\nwindow size.

The source exhibits remarkable spectral\nvariability from months to years timescales. The observed spectral variability\nis entirely due to variations of the column density of a neutral absorber\ntowards the intrinsic nuclear continuum. The column density is generally\nCompton-thin ranging from a few times 10$^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$ to a few times\n10$^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$. However, one observation reveals a Compton-thick state\nwith column density of the order of 1.5 $\\times$ 10$^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$. The\nobserved variability offers a rare opportunity to study the properties of the\nX-ray absorber(s) in an active galaxy. We identify variable X-ray absorption\nfrom two different components, namely (i) a clumpy torus whose individual\nclumps have a density of $\\leq$ 1.7 $\\times$ 10$^8$ cm$^{-3}$ and an average\ncolumn density of $\\sim$ 4 $\\times$ 10$^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$, and (ii) the broad\nline region (BLR), comprising individual clouds with density of 0.1-8 $\\times$\n10$^9$ cm$^{-3}$ and column density of 10$^{23}$-10$^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$.

Hence, the warm\nabsorbers may be tentatively identified with the warm/hot inter-cloud medium\nwhich ensures that the BLR clouds are in pressure equilibrium with their\nsurroundings. The BLR line-emitting clouds may well be the cold, dense clumps\nof this outflow, whose warm/hot phase is likely more homogeneous, as suggested\nby the lack of strong variability of the warm absorber(s) properties during our\nmonitoring.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Oct 2013 07:56:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

We analyzed the spectra, along with\nancillary data, using the photo-ionization code CLOUDY to establish the atomic\nline fluxes, and determine the properties of the radiation field, as set by the\neffective temperature of the central star. In addition, we measured the\ninfrared spectral features due to dust grains. We find that the Polycyclic\nAromatic Hydrocarbon (PAH) profile over 6-9 um in these C60-bearing carbon-rich\nPNe is of the more chemically-processed class A. The intensity ratio of 3.3 um\nto 11.3 um PAH indicates that the number of C-atoms per PAH in C60-containing\nPNe is small compared to that in non-C60 PNe. The Spitzer spectra also show\nbroad dust features around 11 and 30 um. Analysis of the 30-um feature shows\nthat it is strongly correlated with the continuum, and we propose that a single\ncarbon-based carrier is responsible for both the continuum and the feature. The\nstrength of the 11-um feature is correlated to the temperature of the dust,\nsuggesting that it is at least partially due to a solid-state carrier. The\nchemical abundances of C60-containing PNe can be explained by AGB\nnucleosynthesis models for initially 1.5-2.5 Msun stars with Z=0.004. We\nplotted the locations of C60-containing PNe on a face-on map of the Milky Way\nand we found that most of these PNe are outside the solar circle, consistent\nwith low metallicity values.

These particles could behave as warm dark matter (WDM) and\ngenerate a small-scale cutoff in the linear density power spectrum which scales\napproximately inversely with the particle mass. If this mass is of order a keV,\nthe cutoff occurs on the scale of dwarf galaxies. Thus, in WDM models the\nabundance of small galaxies, such as the satellites that orbit in the halo of\nthe Milky Way, depends on the mass of the warm particle. The abundance also\nscales with the mass of the host galactic halo. We use the \\galform\nsemi-analytic model of galaxy formation to calculate the properties of galaxies\nin universes in which the dark matter is warm. Using this method, we can\ncompare the predicted satellite luminosity functions to the observed data for\nthe Milky Way dwarf spheroidals, and determine a lower bound on the thermally\nproduced WDM particle mass. This depends strongly on the value of the Milky Way\nhalo mass and, to some extent, on the baryonic physics assumed; we examine both\nof these dependencies.

The pulsation does not\ninfluence the inner ejecta, so PDDEL and DDC models exhibit similar radiative\nproperties beyond maximum. However, at early times, PDDEL models show bluer\noptical colors and a higher luminosity, even for weak mixing.

The wave packet splits into two peaks\nwith unequal amplitudes after a certain time depending on spin-orbit coupling\nconstant.

These\nswing provided the strongest confirmation of the pulsar recycling scenario\navailable so far. During the two XMM-Newton observations that were carried out\nwhile the source was in outburst in April 2013, IGR J18245-2452 displayed a\nunique and peculiar variability of its X-ray emission. In this work, we report\non a detailed analysis of the XMM- Newton data and focus in particular on the\ntiming and spectral variability of the source. IGR J18245-2452 continuously\nswitches between lower and higher intensity states, with typical variations in\nflux up to a factor of about 500 in time scales as short as few seconds. These\nvariations in the source intensity are sometimes associated to a dramatic\nspectral hardening, during which the power-law photon index of the source\nchanges from Gamma=1.7 to Gamma=0.9. The pulse profiles extracted at different\ncount rates and energies show a complex variability. These phenomena are not\nusually observed in accreting millisecond X-ray pulsars, at least not on such a\nshort time scale. Fast variability was also found in the ATCA radio\nobservations carried out for about 6 hours during the outburst at a frequency\nof 5.5 and 9 GHz. We interpret the variability observed from IGR J18245-2452 in\nterms of a \"hiccup\" accretion phase, during which the accretion of material\nfrom the inner boundary of the Keplerian disk is reduced by the onset of\ncentrifugal inhibition of accretion, possibly causing the launch of strong\noutflows. Changes across accretion and propeller regimes have been long\npredicted and reproduced by MHD simulations of accreting millisecond X-ray\npulsars but never observed to produce an extreme variability as that shown by\nIGR J18245-2452.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Oct 2013 12:33:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 May 2014 09:37:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-05"}

A HPC cloud is such cloud computing\nenvironment. One of challenges of energy efficient resource allocation for VMs\nin HPC cloud is tradeoff between minimizing total energy consumption of\nphysical machines (PMs) and satisfying Quality of Service (e.g. performance).\nOn one hand, cloud providers want to maximize their profit by reducing the\npower cost (e.g. using the smallest number of running PMs). On the other hand,\ncloud customers (users) want highest performance for their applications. In\nthis paper, we focus on the scenario that scheduler does not know global\ninformation about user jobs and user applications in the future. Users will\nrequest shortterm resources at fixed start times and non interrupted durations.\nWe then propose a new allocation heuristic (named Energy-aware and Performance\nper watt oriented Bestfit (EPOBF)) that uses metric of performance per watt to\nchoose which most energy-efficient PM for mapping each VM (e.g. maximum of MIPS\nper Watt). Using information from Feitelson's Parallel Workload Archive to\nmodel HPC jobs, we compare the proposed EPOBF to state of the art heuristics on\nheterogeneous PMs (each PM has multicore CPU). Simulations show that the EPOBF\ncan reduce significant total energy consumption in comparison with state of the\nart allocation heuristics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Oct 2013 13:42:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Nov 2013 04:49:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 15 Sep 2014 01:54:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-16"}

A consequence is Landauer's\nerasure principle, which states that the erasure of 1 bit of information\nrequires a minimum energy cost equal to $kT\\ln(2)$ where $T$ is the temperature\nof a thermal reservoir used in the process and $k$ is Boltzmann's constant.\nJaynes, however, argued that the maximum entropy principle could be applied to\nany number of conserved quantities which would suggest that information erasure\nmay have alternative costs. Indeed we showed recently that by using a reservoir\ncomprising energy degenerate spins and subject to conservation of angular\nmomentum, the cost of information erasure is in terms of angular momentum\nrather than energy. Here we extend this analysis and derive the minimum cost of\ninformation erasure for systems where different conservation laws operate. We\nfind that, for each conserved quantity, the minimum resource needed to erase 1\nbit of memory is $\\lambda^{-1}\\ln(2)$ where $\\lambda$ is related to the average\nvalue of the conserved quantity. The costs of erasure depend, fundamentally, on\nboth the nature of the physical memory element and the reservoir with which it\nis coupled.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Oct 2013 14:47:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-19"}

In\nparticular, it is observed that increasing the number of relays for a range of\ncell sizes, although marginally increases the attainable SE, reduces the EE\nsignificantly. It is noted that the highest SE and EE are achieved, when the\nrelays are placed closer to the BS to take advantage of the resultant\nline-of-sight link. Furthermore, increasing both the number of available\nsubcarriers and the number of active user equipment (UE) increases both the EE\nand the total SE of the system as a benefit of the increased frequency and\nmulti-user diversity, respectively. Finally, it is demonstrated that as\nexpected, increasing the available power tends to improve the SE, when using\nthe SEM algorithm. By contrast, given a sufficiently high available power, the\nEEM algorithm attains the maximum achievable EE and a suboptimal SE.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Oct 2013 15:31:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-08"}
