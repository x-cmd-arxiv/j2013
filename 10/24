In Lehner et al. (2013), we recently showed that low-z\nLLSs have a bimodal metallicity distribution. Here we extend that analysis to\nsearch for differences between the high-ion and kinematic properties of the\nmetal-poor and metal-rich branches. We find that metal-rich LLSs tend to show\nhigher O VI columns and broader O VI profiles than metal-poor LLSs. The total H\nI line width (dv90 statistic) in LLSs is not correlated with metallicity,\nindicating that the H I kinematics alone cannot be used to distinguish inflow\nfrom outflow and gas recycling. Among the 17 LLSs with O VI detections, all but\ntwo show evidence of kinematic sub-structure, in the form of O VI-H I centroid\noffsets, multiple components, or both. Using various scenarios for how the\nmetallicity in the high-ion and low-ion phases of each LLS compare, we\nconstrain the ionized hydrogen column in the O VI phase to lie in the range log\nN(H II)~17.6-20. The O VI phase of LLSs is a substantial baryon reservoir, with\nM(high-ion)~10^{8.5-10.9}(r/150 kpc)^2 solar masses, similar to the mass in the\nlow-ion phase. Accounting for the O VI phase approximately doubles the\ncontribution of low-z LLSs to the cosmic baryon budget.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Oct 2013 16:04:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Nov 2013 21:12:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

In our model, we study a finite\npopulation in continuous time, where each individual is characterized by a\ntrait under selection and a completely linked neutral marker. Population\ndynamics are driven by births and deaths, mutations at birth, and competition\nbetween individuals. Trait values influence ecological processes (demographic\nevents, competition), and competition generates selection on trait variation,\nthus closing the eco-evolutionary feedback loop. The demographic effects of the\ntrait are also expected to influence the generation and maintenance of neutral\nvariation. We consider a large population limit with rare mutation, under the\nassumption that the neutral marker mutates faster than the trait under\nselection. We prove the convergence of the stochastic individual-based process\nto a new measure-valued diffusive process with jumps that we call Substitution\nFleming-Viot Process (SFVP). When restricted to the trait space this process is\nthe Trait Substitution Sequence first introduced by Metz et al. (1996). During\nthe invasion of a favorable mutation, a genetical bottleneck occurs and the\nmarker associated with this favorable mutant is hitchhiked. By rigorously\nanalysing the hitchhiking effect and how the neutral diversity is restored\nafterwards, we obtain the condition for a time-scale separation; under this\ncondition, we show that the marker distribution is approximated by a\nFleming-Viot distribution between two trait substitutions. We discuss the\nimplications of the SFVP for our understanding of the dynamics of neutral\nvariation under eco-evolutionary feedbacks and illustrate the main phenomena\nwith simulations. Our results highlight the joint importance of mutations,\necological parameters, and trait values in the restoration of neutral diversity\nafter a selective sweep.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Oct 2013 16:15:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 22 May 2014 20:17:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-15"}

Many of these processors now feature hardware virtualization\ncapabilities, such as the ARM Cortex A15, and x86 processors with Intel VT-x or\nAMD-V support. Hardware virtualization offers opportunities to partition\nphysical resources, including processor cores, memory and I/O devices amongst\nguest virtual machines. Mixed criticality systems and services can then\nco-exist on the same platform in separate virtual machines. However,\ntraditional virtual machine systems are too expensive because of the costs of\ntrapping into hypervisors to multiplex and manage machine physical resources on\nbehalf of separate guests. For example, hypervisors are needed to schedule\nseparate VMs on physical processor cores. In this paper, we discuss the design\nof the Quest-V separation kernel, that partitions services of different\ncriticalities in separate virtual machines, or sandboxes. Each sandbox\nencapsulates a subset of machine physical resources that it manages without\nrequiring intervention of a hypervisor.

Epidemiological models\nincreasingly account for reductions in infectious contact, such as\nrisk-aversion behaviour in response to pathogen outbreaks. However, market\ndynamics clearly differ from simple risk-aversion, as are driven by different\nmotivation and conditioned by trade constraints, known in economics as\nfriction, that arise because exchanges are costly. Here we develop a novel\neconomic-market model where transient and long-term market dynamics are\ndetermined by trade friction and agent adaptation, and can influence disease\ntransmission. We specify the participants, frequency, volume, and price in\ntrade transactions, and investigate, using analytical insights and simulation,\nhow trade friction affects joint market and epidemiological dynamics. The\nfriction values explored encompass estimates from French cattle and pig\nmarkets. We show that, when trade is the dominant route of transmission, market\nfriction can be a significantly stronger determinant of epidemics than\nrisk-aversion behaviour. In particular, there is a critical friction level\nabove which epidemics do not occur. For a given level of friction, open\nunregulated markets can boost epidemics compared with closed or tightly\nregulated markets. Our results are robust to model specificities and can hold\nin the presence of non-trade disease-transmission routes. In particular, we try\nto explain why outbreaks in French livestock markets appear more frequently in\ncattle than swine despite swine trade-flow being larger. To minimize contagion\nin markets, safety policies could generate incentives for larger-volume,\nless-frequent transactions, increasing trade friction without necessarily\naffecting overall trade flow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Oct 2013 18:28:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-24"}

We show that there are dual scaling\nfunctions governing the dynamic scaling, which together describe the scaling\nbehavior in the entire velocity range $v \\in [0, \\infty)$. These functions have\nasymptotics corresponding to the adiabatic and diabatic limit, and close to\nthese limits they are perturbative in $v$ and $1/v$, respectively. Away from\ntheir perturbative domains, both functions cross over into the same universal\npower-law scaling form governed by the static and dynamic critical exponents\n(as well as an exponent characterizing the quench protocol).

We interpret this disconnect between the two scaling regimes as a dynamic\nphase transition of the Wolff algorithm, caused by an effective sudden loss of\nergodicity at high velocity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Oct 2013 18:51:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 6 Feb 2014 16:22:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-25"}

Psychologists and behavioral economists also make use of\nconcepts such as loss aversion and probability weighting to model risk\naversion. Neurophysiological evidence suggests that loss aversion has its\norigins in relatively ancient neural circuitries (e.g., ventral striatum).\nCould there thus be an evolutionary origin to risk avoidance? We study this\nquestion by evolving strategies that adapt to play the equivalent mean payoff\ngamble. We hypothesize that risk aversion in the equivalent mean payoff gamble\nis beneficial as an adaptation to living in small groups, and find that a\npreference for risk averse strategies only evolves in small populations of less\nthan 1,000 individuals, while agents exhibit no such strategy preference in\nlarger populations. Further, we discover that risk aversion can also evolve in\nlarger populations, but only when the population is segmented into small groups\nof around 150 individuals. Finally, we observe that risk aversion only evolves\nwhen the gamble is a rare event that has a large impact on the individual's\nfitness. These findings align with earlier reports that humans lived in small\ngroups for a large portion of their evolutionary history. As such, we suggest\nthat rare, high-risk, high-payoff events such as mating and mate competition\ncould have driven the evolution of risk averse behavior in humans living in\nsmall groups.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Oct 2013 19:27:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-18"}

The remaining 19 SMGs have insufficient\noptical or near-infrared photometry to derive photometric redshifts, but a\nstacking analysis of IRAC and Herschel observations confirms they are not\nspurious. Assuming these sources have an absolute H-band magnitude distribution\ncomparable to that of a complete sample of z~1-2 SMGs, we demonstrate that the\nundetected SMGs lie at higher redshifts, raising the median redshift for SMGs\nto z=2.5+/-0.2. More critically we show that the proportion of galaxies\nundergoing an SMG phase at z>3 is 35+/-5% of the total population. We derive a\nmedian stellar mass for SMGs of Mstar=(8+/-1)x10^10Mo, but caution that there\nare significant systematic uncertainties in our stellar mass estimate, up to x5\nfor individual sources. We compare our sample of SMGs to a volume-limited,\nmorphologically classified sample of ellipticals in the local Universe.\nAssuming the star formation activity in SMGs has a timescale of ~100Myr we show\nthat their descendants at z~0 would have a space density and M_H distribution\nwhich are in good agreement with those of local ellipticals. In addition the\ninferred mass-weighted ages of the local ellipticals broadly agree with the\nlook-back times of the SMG events. Taken together, these results are consistent\nwith a simple model that identifies SMGs as events that form most of the stars\nseen in the majority of luminous elliptical galaxies at the present day.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Oct 2013 20:00:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Apr 2014 08:14:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

While most of these massive galaxies must have subsequently\ntransformed through on-going star formation and mergers with other galaxies, a\nsmall fraction (<0.1%) may have survived untouched till today. Searches for\nsuch relic galaxies, useful windows to explore the early Universe, have been\ninconclusive to date: galaxies with masses and sizes like those observed at\nhigh redshift (M*>10^11 Msun; Re<1.5 kpc) have been found in the local\nUniverse, but their stars are far too young for the galaxy to be a relic\ngalaxy. This paper explores the first case of a nearby galaxy, NGC1277 (in the\nPerseus cluster at a distance of 73 Mpc), which fulfills all the criteria to be\nconsidered a relic galaxy. Using deep optical spectroscopy, we derive the star\nformation history along the structure of the galaxy: the stellar populations\nare uniformly old (>10 Gyr) with no evidence for more recent star formation\nepisodes. The metallicity of their stars is super-solar ([Fe/H]=0.20+-0.04) and\nalpha enriched ([alpha/Fe]=0.4+-0.1). This suggests a very short formation time\nscale for the bulk of stars of this galaxy. This object also rotates very fast\n(Vrot~300 km/s) and has a large velocity dispersion (sigma>300 km/s).

However, deep sequencing and assembly of all of\nmillions of cells in a sample is prohibitively costly. A property that can come\nto rescue is that deep sequencing of every cell should not be necessary to\ncapture all distinct genomes, as the majority of cells are biological\nreplicates. Biologically important samples are often sparse in that sense. In\nthis paper, we propose an adaptive compressed method, also known as distilled\nsensing, to capture all distinct genomes in a sparse microbial community with\nreduced sequencing effort. As opposed to group testing in which the number of\ndistinct events is often constant and sparsity is equivalent to rarity of an\nevent, sparsity in our case means scarcity of distinct events in comparison to\nthe data size. Previously, we introduced the problem and proposed a distilled\nsensing solution based on the breadth first search strategy. We simulated the\nwhole process which constrained our ability to study the behavior of the\nalgorithm for the entire ensemble due to its computational intensity. In this\npaper, we modify our previous breadth first search strategy and introduce the\ndepth first search strategy. Instead of simulating the entire process, which is\nintractable for a large number of experiments, we provide a dynamic programming\nalgorithm to analyze the behavior of the method for the entire ensemble. The\nensemble analysis algorithm recursively calculates the probability of capturing\nevery distinct genome and also the expected total sequenced nucleotides for a\ngiven population profile. Our results suggest that the expected total sequenced\nnucleotides grows proportional to $\\log$ of the number of cells and\nproportional linearly with the number of distinct genomes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Oct 2013 21:37:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 25 Apr 2014 21:27:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-29"}

We assembled high S/N ratio composite spectra of a\nsequence of these AGN defined by the ionization level of their narrow-line\nregions (NLR), extending down to very low-ionization cases. We used a local\noptimally emitting cloud (LOC) model to fit emission-line ratios in this AGN\nsequence. These included the weak lines that can be measured only in the\nco-added spectra, providing consistency checks on strong line diagnostics.\nAfter integrating over a wide range of radii and densities our models indicate\nthat the radial extent of the NLR is the major parameter in determining the\nposition of high to moderate ionization AGN along our sequence, providing a\nphysical interpretation for their systematic variation. Higher ionization AGN\ncontain optimally emitting clouds that are more concentrated towards the\ncentral continuum source than in lower ionization AGN. Our LOC models indicate\nthat for the objects that lie on our AGN sequence, the ionizing luminosity is\nanticorrelated with the NLR ionization level, and hence anticorrelated with the\nradial concentration and physical extent of the NLR. A possible interpretation\nthat deserves further exploration is that the ionization sequence might be an\nage sequence where low ionization objects are older and have systematically\ncleared out their central regions by radiation pressure. We consider that our\nAGN sequence instead represents a mixing curve of SF and AGN spectra, but argue\nthat while many galaxies do have this type of composite spectra, our AGN\nsequence appears to be a special set of objects with negligible SF excitation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Oct 2013 21:48:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

We consider three simulations, each with a different\ncombination of physical size, rms sonic Mach number, and Jeans parameter, but\nchosen as to give the same value of the virial parameter and to conform with\nLarson's scaling relations. As in the non-magnetic case: we find no\nsimultaneously subsonic and super-Jeans structures in our MHD simulations. We\nfind that the fraction of small-scale super-Jeans structures increases when\nself gravity is turned on, and that the production of gravitationally unstable\ndense cores by turbulence alone is very low. This implies that self-gravity is\nin general necessary not only to induce the collapse of Jeans-unstable cores,\nbut also to form them. We find that denser regions tend to have more negative\nvalues of the velocity divergence, implying a net inwards flow towards the\nregions' centers.

While link scheduling answers the above question for\npoint-to-point physical layers which are designed for an interference-avoidance\nparadigm, we look for answers in cases when interference can be embraced by\nadvanced PHY layer design, as suggested by results in network information\ntheory.\n  To make progress on this challenging problem, we propose a constructive\ndistributed algorithm that achieves rates higher than link scheduling based on\ninterference avoidance, especially if each node knows more than one hop of\nnetwork state information. We compare our new aggressive algorithm to a\nconservative algorithm we have presented in [1]. Both algorithms schedule\nsub-networks such that each sub-network can employ advanced\ninterference-embracing coding schemes to achieve higher rates. Our innovation\nis in the identification, selection and scheduling of sub-networks, especially\nwhen sub-networks are larger than a single link.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Oct 2013 00:35:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-04"}

Therefore this notion has been widely used in the verification of\nHSs. A stronger condition on barrier certificates means that less expressive\nbarrier certificates can be synthesized. On the other hand, synthesizing more\nexpressive barrier certificates often means high complexity. In [9], Kong et al\nconsid- ered how to relax the condition of barrier certificates while still\nkeeping their convexity so that one can synthesize more expressive barrier\ncertificates efficiently using semi-definite programming (SDP). In this paper,\nwe first discuss how to relax the condition of barrier certificates in a\ngeneral way, while still keeping their convexity. Particularly, one can then\nutilize different weaker conditions flexibly to synthesize dif- ferent kinds of\nbarrier certificates with more expressiveness efficiently using SDP. These\nbarriers give more opportuni- ties to verify the considered system. We also\nshow how to combine two functions together to form a combined barrier\ncertificate in order to prove a safety property under consid- eration, whereas\nneither of them can be used as a barrier certificate separately, even according\nto any relaxed condi- tion. Another contribution of this paper is that we\ndiscuss how to discover certificates from the general relaxed condi- tion by\nSDP. In particular, we focus on how to avoid the unsoundness because of numeric\nerror caused by SDP with symbolic checking\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Oct 2013 04:31:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-25"}

Given the presence of arbitrary finite sets in these problems, the\nmethods used to attack these problems have primarily been combinatorial in\nnature. In recent years, however, many outstanding problems in these questions\nhave been solved by algebraic means (and more specifically, using tools from\nalgebraic geometry and/or algebraic topology), giving rise to an emerging set\nof techniques which is now known as the polynomial method.\n  While various instances of the polynomial method have been known for decades\n(e.g. Stepanov's method, the combinatorial nullstellensatz, or Baker's\ntheorem), the general theory of this method is still in the process of\nmaturing; in particular, the limitations of the polynomial method are not well\nunderstood, and there is still considerable scope to apply deeper results from\nalgebraic geometry or algebraic topology to strengthen the method further.

Our\nresults show that the temperature response of the T1u mode is clearly different\nfrom that of the T2g mode for all three pyrochlores. In this regard, two\nfeatures are of particular note for both K and Rb; (1) the T1u mode exhibits a\ndistinctly stronger softening response with decreasing temperature compared to\nthe T2g mode, and (2) the T1u mode becomes stronger and sharper with decreasing\ntemperature. These two findings suggest that the T1u mode is significantly more\nanharmonic and sensitive to the cage dynamics than the T2g mode. Examination of\nthe local potentials around the alkali-metal atoms reveals that K has the\nflattest and most anharmonic potential at all temperatures while Cs exhibits\nthe narrowest potential. The temperature dependence of the local potentials\nreveals that, for K, the potential at a higher temperature is not a simple\nextrapolation to higher energy of that at a lower temperature. Instead, we find\nsignificant reconstruction of the potential at different temperatures. Finally,\nwe explore the temperature response of the coupling between the alkali metals\nand find a complex temperature dependence which suggests that the origin of the\ncoupling may be more complex than a pure Coulomb interaction. We also find an\nunexpected increase in the static disorder of the system at low temperatures\nfor the K and Rb pyrochlores.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Oct 2013 04:47:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-25"}

The time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) theory and the\ncoupled-channels (CC) method are standard approaches to investigate this aspect\nof fusion dynamics. However, both approaches present limitations, such as a\nlack of tunnelling of the many-body wave function in the former and a need for\nexternal parameters to describe the nucleus-nucleus potential and the couplings\nin the latter. Method: A method combining both approaches is proposed to\novercome these limitations. CC calculations are performed using two types of\ninputs from Hartree-Fock (HF) theory: the nucleus-nucleus potential calculated\nwith the frozen HF method, and the properties of low-lying vibrational states\nand giant resonances computed from the TDHF linear response.

This work demonstrates\nthat the main effect of these couplings is a lowering of the barrier, in good\nagreement with the fusion thresholds predicted by TDHF calculations.\nConclusions: As the only phenomenological inputs are the choice of the internal\nstates of the nuclei and the parameters of the energy density functional used\nin the HF and TDHF calculations, the method presented in this work has a broad\nrange of possible applications, including studies of alternative couplings or\nreactions involving exotic nuclei.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Oct 2013 07:03:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 1 Dec 2013 23:43:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-09"}

This topological instability is shown to result from a local\ndeformation of the global bifurcation diagram associated with the corresponding\nelliptic problems. Such a deformation is shown to systematically occur via the\ncreation of either a multiple-point or a new fold-point on this diagram when an\nappropriate small perturbation is applied to the nonlinear term. More\nprecisely, it is shown that for a broad class of nonlinear elliptic problems,\none can always find an arbitrary small perturbation of the nonlinear term, that\ngenerates a local S on the bifurcation diagram whereas the latter is e.g.\nmonotone when no perturbation is applied; substituting thus a single solution\nby several ones. Such an increase in the local multiplicity of the solutions to\nthe elliptic problem results then into a topological instability for the\ncorresponding parabolic problem.\n  The rigorous proof of the latter instability result requires though to\nrevisit the classical concept of topological equivalence to encompass important\ncases for the applications such as semi-linear parabolic problems for which the\nsemigroup may exhibit non-global dissipative properties, allowing for the\ncoexistence of blow-up regions and local attractors in the phase space; cases\nthat arise e.g. in combustion theory. A revised framework of topological\nrobustness is thus introduced in that respect within which the main topological\ninstability result is then proved for continuous, locally Lipschitz but not\nnecessarily $C^1$ nonlinear terms, that prevent in particular the use of\nlinearization techniques, and for which the family of semigroups may exhibit\nnon-dissipative properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Oct 2013 07:36:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Oct 2013 01:15:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 18 Jan 2018 23:58:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-22"}

Important open questions\ninclude the relation between neuronal versus astrocytic energy demand, glucose\nuptake and intercellular lactate transfer, as well as their dependence on the\nlevel of activity. We have developed a large-scale, constraint-based network\nmodel of the metabolic partnership between astrocytes and glutamatergic neurons\nthat allows for a quantitative appraisal of the extent to which stoichiometry\nalone drives the energetics of the system. We find that the velocity of the\nglutamate-glutamine cycle ($V_{cyc}$) explains part of the uncoupling between\nglucose and oxygen utilization at increasing $V_{cyc}$ levels. Thus, we are\nable to characterize different activation states in terms of the tissue\noxygen-glucose index (OGI). Calculations show that glucose is taken up and\nmetabolized according to cellular energy requirements, and that partitioning of\nthe sugar between different cell types is not significantly affected by\n$V_{cyc}$. Furthermore, both the direction and magnitude of the lactate shuttle\nbetween neurons and astrocytes turn out to depend on the relative cell glucose\nuptake while being roughly independent of $V_{cyc}$. These findings suggest\nthat, in absence of ad hoc activity-related constraints on neuronal and\nastrocytic metabolism, the glutamate-glutamine cycle does not control the\nrelative energy demand of neurons and astrocytes, and hence their glucose\nuptake and lactate exchange.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Oct 2013 10:40:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-25"}

GMCs with masses close to the minimal stable mass\nagainst tidal disruption are not unusual in terms of their mass, location, or\nCO brightness, but we note that GMCs with large velocity dispersion tend to be\nmore sensitive to tidal instability.

The\nnanowires were grown by electrochemical deposition in heavy-ion-track etched\npolycarbonate templates. The nanogranular Co structure was fabricated by\nfocused electron beam induced deposition (FEBID), while the amorphous W inducer\nwas obtained by focused ion beam induced deposition (FIBID). For electrical\nresistance measurements up to three pairs of Pt voltage leads were deposited by\nFIBID at different distances beside the inner inducer electrode, thus allowing\nus to probe the proximity effect over a length of 2-12 $\\mu$m. Relative $R(T)$\ndrops of the same order of magnitude have been observed for the Co and Cu\nnanowires when sweeping the temperature below 5.2 K ($T_c$ of the\nFIBID-deposited W inducer). By contrast, relative $R(T)$ drops were found to be\nan order of magnitude smaller for the nanogranular Co nanowire structure. Our\nanalysis of the resistance data shows that the superconducting proximity length\nin crystalline Cu and Co is about 1 $\\mu$m at low temperatures, attesting to a\nlong-range proximity effect in the case of ferromagnetic Co. Moreover, this\nlong-range proximity effect has been revealed to be insusceptible to magnetic\nfields up to 11 T, which is indicative of spin-triplet pairing. At the same\ntime, in the nanogranular Co structure proximity-induced superconductivity is\nstrongly suppressed due to the dominating Cooper pair scattering caused by the\nintrinsic microstructure of the FEBID deposit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Oct 2013 13:08:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-25"}

We propose a new method to analyse pulsar nulling phenomenon, by\ninvolving two key parameters, the nulling degree, $\\chi$, which is defined as\nthe angle in a rectangular coordinates for the numbers of nulling periods and\nbursting periods, and the nulling scale, $ N $, which is defined as the\neffective length of the consecutive nulling periods and bursting periods. The\nnulling degree $\\chi$ can be calculated by $\\tan \\chi = N_{\\rm nulling} /\nN_{\\rm bursting} $ and the mean is related to the nulling fraction, while the\nnulling scale, $ N $, is also a newly defined fundamental parameter which\nindicates how often the nulling occurs. We determined the distributions of\n$\\chi$ and $ N $ for 10 pulsars by using the data in literature. We found that\nthe nulling degree $\\chi$ indicates the relative length of nulling to that of\nbursting, and the nulling scale $ N $ is found to be related to the derivative\nof rotation frequency and hence the loss rate of rotational energy of pulsars.\nTheir deviations reflect the randomness of the nulling process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Oct 2013 13:31:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-29"}

Salient regions can serve as inputs for object detectors as\nwell as inputs for region based registration algorithms. In this paper we\nconsider the problem of speeding up computationally intensive bottom-up salient\nregion detection in 3D medical volumes.The method uses the Kadir Brady\nformulation of saliency. We show that in the vicinity of a salient region,\nentropy is a monotonically increasing function of the degree of overlap of a\ncandidate window with the salient region. This allows us to initialize a sparse\nseed-point grid as the set of tentative salient region centers and iteratively\nconverge to the local entropy maxima, thereby reducing the computation\ncomplexity compared to the Kadir Brady approach of performing this computation\nat every point in the image. We propose two different approaches for achieving\nthis. The first approach involves evaluating entropy in the four quadrants\naround the seed point and iteratively moving in the direction that increases\nentropy. The second approach we propose makes use of mean shift tracking\nframework to affect entropy maximizing moves. Specifically, we propose the use\nof uniform pmf as the target distribution to seek high entropy regions.

While stationary Turing patterns are broadly\nknown, the oscillatory instability, leading to traveling waves in continuous\nmedia and also called the wave bifurcation, is rare for chemical systems. Here,\nwe extend the analysis by Turing to general networks and apply it to ecological\nmetapopulations of biological species with dispersal connections between\nhabitats. Remarkably, the oscillatory Turing instability does not lead to wave\npatterns in networks, but to spontaneous development of heterogeneous\noscillations and possible extinction of some species, even though they are\nabsent for isolated populations. Furthermore, our theoretical analysis reveals\nthat this instability is more common in ecological metapopulations than in\nchemical reactions. Indeed, we find the instabilities for all possible food\nwebs with three predator or prey species, under various assumptions about the\nmobility of individual species and nonlinear interactions between them.\nTherefore, we suggest that the oscillatory Turing instability is generic and\nmust play a fundamental role in metapopulation dynamics, providing a common\nmechanism for dispersal-induced destabilization of ecosystems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Oct 2013 10:16:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-28"}
