Shooting photon packages through the geometrically\nmuch more complex 3D Voronoi grid is only about three times slower than the\nequivalent process in an octree grid with the same number of cells, while in\nfact the total number of Voronoi grid cells may be lower for an equally good\nrepresentation of the density field.

We extend the existing theory to include the more\nrealistic possibility that the price at which the investors trade is dependent\non the traded volume. The investors in the market always buy at the ask and\nsell at the bid price. Implicit transaction costs are composed of two terms,\none is able to capture the bid-ask spread, and the second the price impact.\nMoreover, a new definition of a self-financing portfolio is obtained. The\nself-financing condition suggests that continuous trading is possible, but is\nrestricted to predictable trading strategies having c\\'adl\\'ag\n(right-continuous with left limits) and c\\'agl\\'ad (left-continuous with right\nlimits) paths of bounded quadratic variation and of finitely many jumps.

We show that a large residue in Hbar is caused by a\ntendency for the trajectories to be confined to sub-regions of configuration\nspace for some wave functions, and that this is less likely to occur for larger\nnumbers of energy states (if the initial phases are chosen randomly). Possible\ncosmological implications are briefly discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Oct 2013 19:43:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Aug 2014 20:21:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

However, the central contribution\nof this manuscript is to demonstrate how and why the policy is far more likely\nto apply to a very large fraction (i.e., the vast majority) of Jews. This claim\nis supported using a series of genealogical models that include transmissable\n\"identities\" and preferential intra-group mating. Model analysis reveals that\neven when intra-group mating is strong and even if only a small subset of a\npresent-day population retains cultural practices typically associated with\nthat of an ancestral group, it is highly likely that nearly all members of that\npopulation have direct geneaological links to that ancestral group, given\nsufficient number of generations have elapsed. The basis for this conclusion is\nthat not having a link to an ancestral group must be a property of all of an\nindividual's ancestors, the probability of which declines (nearly)\nsuperexponentially with each successive generation.

Many\npopular models of the co-evolutionary growth of galaxies and SMBHs predict that\nQSOs are also sites of substantial recent star formation, mediated by important\nprocesses, such as major mergers, which rapidly transform the nature of\ngalaxies. A detailed study of the star-forming properties of QSOs is a critical\ntest of such models. We present a far-infrared Herschel/PACS study of the mean\nstar formation rate (SFR) of a sample of spectroscopically observed QSOs to z~2\nfrom the COSMOS extragalactic survey. This is the largest sample to date of\nmoderately luminous AGNs studied using uniform, deep far-infrared photometry.\nWe study trends of the mean SFR with redshift, black hole mass, nuclear\nbolometric luminosity and specific accretion rate (Eddington ratio). To\nminimize systematics, we have undertaken a uniform determination of SMBH\nproperties, as well as an analysis of important selection effects within\nspectroscopic QSO samples that influence the interpretation of SFR trends. We\nfind that the mean SFRs of these QSOs are consistent with those of normal\nmassive star-forming galaxies with a fixed scaling between SMBH and galaxy mass\nat all redshifts. No strong enhancement in SFR is found even among the most\nrapidly accreting systems, at odds with several co-evolutionary models.\nFinally, we consider the qualitative effects on mean SFR trends from different\nassumptions about the star-forming properties of QSO hosts and redshift\nevolution of the SMBH-galaxy relationship. While limited currently by\nuncertainties, valuable constraints on AGN-galaxy co-evolution can emerge from\nour approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Oct 2013 20:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

QCMDO\nproblems are NP-hard, and no efficient classical algorithm for their solution\nis known. Included in the class of QCMDO problems are combinatorial\noptimization problems constrained by a linear partial differential equation\n(PDE) or system of linear PDEs. An essential complication commonly encountered\nin solving this type of problem is that the linear constraint may introduce\nmany intermediate continuous variables into the optimization while the\ncomputational cost grows exponentially with problem size. We resolve this\ndifficulty by developing a constructive mapping from QCMDO to quadratic\nunconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) such that the size of the QUBO problem\ndepends only on the number of discrete control variables. With a suitable\nembedding, taking into account the physical constraints of the realizable\ncoupling graph, the resulting QUBO problem can be implemented on an existing\nAQO. The mapping itself is efficient, scaling cubically with the number of\ncontinuous variables in the general case and linearly in the PDE case if an\nefficient preconditioner is available.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Oct 2013 20:05:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 20 Mar 2014 21:33:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-16"}

To generate a more realistic scenario, we use a\ngeneralized multiplex network and assume that only a fraction $q$ of the nodes\nare shared by the layers. We develop a theoretical framework for a branching\nprocess to describe the spread of an epidemic on these partially overlapped\nmultiplex networks.

Imagine we have\nobservations from the linear model y = X beta + z, then we suggest estimating\nthe regression coefficients by means of a new estimator called SLOPE, which is\nthe solution to minimize 0.5 ||y - Xb\\|_2^2 + lambda_1 |b|_(1) + lambda_2\n|b|_(2) + ... + lambda_p |b|_(p); here, lambda_1 >= \\lambda_2 >= ... >=\n\\lambda_p >= 0 and |b|_(1) >= |b|_(2) >= ... >= |b|_(p) is the order statistic\nof the magnitudes of b. The regularizer is a sorted L1 norm which penalizes the\nregression coefficients according to their rank: the higher the rank, the\nlarger the penalty. This is similar to the famous BHq procedure [Benjamini and\nHochberg, 1995], which compares the value of a test statistic taken from a\nfamily to a critical threshold that depends on its rank in the family. SLOPE is\na convex program and we demonstrate an efficient algorithm for computing the\nsolution. We prove that for orthogonal designs with p variables, taking\nlambda_i = F^{-1}(1-q_i) (F is the cdf of the errors), q_i = iq/(2p), controls\nthe false discovery rate (FDR) for variable selection. When the design matrix\nis nonorthogonal there are inherent limitations on the FDR level and the power\nwhich can be obtained with model selection methods based on L1-like penalties.\nHowever, whenever the columns of the design matrix are not strongly correlated,\nwe demonstrate empirically that it is possible to select the parameters\nlambda_i as to obtain FDR control at a reasonable level as long as the number\nof nonzero coefficients is not too large. At the same time, the procedure\nexhibits increased power over the lasso, which treats all coefficients equally.\nThe paper illustrates further estimation properties of the new selection rule\nthrough comprehensive simulation studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Oct 2013 22:31:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Oct 2013 18:36:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-30"}

In this paper,\nwe have further investigated its influence upon the electron high-harmonic\ngeneration (HHG) by treating the spacial gradient of the laser intensity as a\nponderomotive potential. Based upon perturbative QED calculations, it has been\nfound that the main effect of the intensity gradient is the broadening of the\noriginally line HHG spectra. A one-to-one relationship can be built between the\nbeam width and the corresponding line width. Hence this finding may provides us\na promising way to measure the beam width of intense lasers in experiments. In\naddition, for a laser pulse, we have also studied the different influences from\ntransverse and longitudinal intensity gradients upon HHG.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Oct 2013 02:23:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

Thus,\na certain mechanism is needed to exist in order to suppress intrinsic noise.\nHere, through a model study of elastically coupled hair bundles of bullfrog\nsacculi, we show that a low stimulus threshold and a high signal-to-noise ratio\n(SNR) can be achieved through the amplitude death phenomenon (the cessation of\nspontaneous oscillations by coupling). This phenomenon occurs only when the\ncoupled hair bundles have inhomogeneous distribution, which is likely to be the\ncase in biological systems. We show that the SNR has non-monotonic dependence\non the mass of the overlying membrane, and find out that the SNR has maximum\nvalue in the region of the amplitude death. The low threshold of stimulus\nthrough amplitude death may account for the experimentally observed high\nsensitivity of frog sacculi in detecting vibration.

We have recently shown\nthat protoplanetary disks have multiple planet traps that are characterized by\norbital radii in the disks and halt rapid type I planetary migration. By\ncoupling planet traps with the standard core accretion scenario, we showed that\none can account for the positions of planets in the mass-period diagram. In\nthis paper, we demonstrate quantitatively that most gas giants formed at planet\ntraps tend to end up around 1 AU with most of these being contributed by dead\nzones and ice lines. In addition, we show that a large fraction of super-Earths\nand hot Neptunes are formed as \"failed\" cores of gas giants - this population\nbeing constituted by comparable contributions from dead zone and heat\ntransition traps. Our results are based on the evolution of forming planets in\nan ensemble of disks where we vary only the lifetimes of disks as well as their\nmass accretion rates onto the host star. We show that a statistical treatment\nof the evolution of a large population of planetary cores initially caught in\nplanet traps accounts for the existence of three distinct exoplantary\npopulations - the hot Jupiters, the more massive planets at roughly orbital\nradii around 1 AU orbital, and the short period SuperEarths and hot Neptunes.\nThere are very few evolutionary tracks that feed into the large orbital radii\ncharacteristic of the imaged Jovian planet, which agrees with recent surveys.\nFinally, we find that low-mass planets in tight orbits become the dominant\nplanetary population for low mass stars ($M_* \\le 0.7 M_{\\odot}$).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Oct 2013 06:20:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

This quantity was\nmeasured via attosecond streaking and studied theoretically by Schultze et al.\n[Science 328, 1658 (2010)]. A substantial discrepancy was found between the\nmeasured and the calculated values of the relative time delay. Several\ntheoretical studies has been put forward to resolve this issue, e.g. by\nincluding correlation effects. In the present paper we explore the directional\ndependence of the photoelectron emission and the consequences for the inferred\ntime delay. Our quantum mechanical calculations for an electron subject to\nlaser fields and an effective single particle potential show that the time\ndelay is indeed strongly angular dependent. Compared to strict forward emission\nwe find that accounting for emission within a cone of 45 deg aperture, leads to\na substantially increase of the relative time delay.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Oct 2013 07:54:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Jul 2014 15:12:19 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 4 Jan 2016 09:18:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-15"}

We\nfind that, depending on the excitability of the network, different working\nregimes are possible. For high excitability, the dynamical attractors are\nstable, and a collective activity that replays one of the stored patterns\nemerges spontaneously, while for low excitability, no replay is induced.\nBetween these two regimes, there is a critical region in which the dynamical\nattractors are unstable, and intermittent short replays are induced by noise.\nAt the critical spiking threshold, the order parameter goes from zero to one,\nand its fluctuations are maximized, as expected for a phase transition (and as\nobserved in recent experimental results in the brain). Notably, in this\ncritical region, the avalanche size and duration distributions follow power\nlaws. Critical exponents are consistent with a scaling relationship observed\nrecently in neural avalanches measurements.

We first consider the\ncase where the edits are a mixture of insertions and deletions (indels), and\npropose an interactive synchronization algorithm with near-optimal\ncommunication rate and average computational complexity of $O(n)$ arithmetic\noperations. The algorithm uses interaction to efficiently split the source\nsequence into substrings containing exactly one deletion or insertion.

Assuming no\ncollaboration between the BSs, the interfering links between a BS and the\nselected users in neighboring cells are difficult to be acquired at the\nbelonging BS.

The basic scheme of Darwinian evolution produces\nadaptations that only represent apparent (\"as if\") goals and meaning. Here I\nuse evolutionary models to show that a slight, evolvable extension of the basic\nscheme is sufficient to produce genuine goals. The extension, targeted\nmodulation of mutation rate, is known to be generally present in biological\ncells, and gives rise to two phenomena that are absent from the non-living\nworld: intrinsic meaning and the ability to initiate goal-directed chains of\ncausation (active causation). The extended scheme accomplishes this by\nutilizing randomness modulated by a feedback loop that is itself regulated by\nevolutionary pressure. The mechanism can be extended to behavioural variability\nas well, and thus shows how freedom of behaviour is possible. A further\nextension to communication suggests that the active exchange of intrinsic\nmeaning between organisms may be the origin of consciousness, which in\ncombination with active causation can provide a physical basis for the\nphenomenon of free will.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Oct 2013 09:49:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Oct 2013 11:37:41 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 18 Feb 2014 15:10:27 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 25 May 2014 08:39:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-04"}

Our aim is twofold: firstly, analyse the relationship between\nexcess-continuum and line emission accretion diagnostics, and, secondly, to\ninvestigate the accretion properties in terms of the physical properties of the\ncentral object. The accretion luminosity (Lacc), and from it the accretion rate\n(Macc), is derived by modelling the excess emission, from the UV to the\nnear-IR, as the continuum emission of a slab of hydrogen. The flux and\nluminosity (Ll) of a large number of emission lines of H, He, CaII, etc.,\nobserved simultaneously in the range from ~330nm to 2500nm, were computed. The\nluminosity of all the lines is well correlated with Lacc. We provide empirical\nrelationships between Lacc and the luminosity of 39 emission lines, which have\na lower dispersion as compared to previous relationships in the literature. Our\nmeasurements extend the Pab and Brg relationships to Lacc values about two\norders of magnitude lower than those reported in previous studies. We confirm\nthat different methodologies to measure Lacc and Macc yield significantly\ndifferent results: Ha line profile modelling may underestimate Macc by 0.6 to\n0.8dex with respect to Macc derived from continuum-excess measures. Such\ndifferences may explain the likely spurious bi-modal relationships between Macc\nand other YSOs properties reported in the literature. We derive Macc in the\nrange 2e-12 -- 4e-8 Msun/yr and conclude that Macc is proportional to\nMstar^1.8(+/-0.2), with a dispersion lower by a factor of about 2 than in\nprevious studies.

Using numerical L1-minimisation\ntechniques established in the application of compressive sensing to radio\nastronomy, we directly solve the deconvolution equation using GPU (graphics\nprocessing unit) hardware. This approach relies on an analytic expression for\nthe contribution of a pixel in the image to the observed visibilities, and the\nwell-known expression for Dirac delta function pixels is used along with two\nnew approximations for Gaussian pixels, which allow for multi-scale\ndeconvolution. The algorithm is similar to the CLEAN algorithm in that it fits\nthe reconstructed pixels in the image to the observed visibilities while\nminimising the total flux; however, unlike CLEAN, it operates on the ungridded\nvisibilities, enforces positivity, and has guaranteed global convergence. The\npixels in the image can be arbitrarily distributed and arbitrary gains between\neach pixel and each antenna element can also be specified. Direct deconvolution\nof the observed visibilities is shown to be feasible for several deconvolution\nproblems, including a 1 megapixel wide-field image with over 400,000\nvisibilities.

Our simulations show that\nseveral terrestrial planets efficiently form outside the orbit of the HJ,\nmaking a chain of planets, and all of them gravitationally interact directly or\nindirectly with the HJ through resonance, which leads to inward migration of\nthe HJ. We call this mechanism of induced migration of the HJ as \"crowding\nout.\" The HJ is eventually lost by collision with the central star, and only\nseveral terrestrial planets remain. We also find that the efficiency of the\ncrowding-out effect depends on model parameters; for example, the heavier the\ndisk is, the more efficient the crowding out is. When planet formation occurs\nin a massive disk, the HJ can be lost to the central star and is never\nobserved. On the other hand, for a less massive disk, the HJ and terrestrial\nplanets can coexist; however, the companion planets can be below the detection\nlimit of current observations. In both cases, systems with the HJ and\nterrestrial planets have little chance for detection. Therefore, our model\nnaturally explains the lack of companion planets in HJ systems regardless of\nthe disk mass. In effect, our model provide a theoretical prediction for future\nobservations; additional planets can be discovered just outside the HJ, and\ntheir masses should generally be small.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Oct 2013 10:46:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Oct 2013 00:31:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

Until recently, these depletion forces were\nconsidered to be entropic in nature, resulting primarily from the tendency to\nincrease the space available to the cosolute. However, recent experimental\nevidence indicates the existence of additional, energetically-dominated\nmechanisms. In this review we follow the emerging characteristics of these\ndifferent mechanisms. By compiling a set of available thermodynamic data for\nprocesses ranging from protein folding to protein-protein interactions, we show\nthat excluded cosolutes can act through two distinct mechanisms that correlate\nto a large extent with their molecular properties. For many polymers at low to\nmoderate concentrations the steric interactions and molecular crowding effects\ndominate, and the mechanism is entropic. To contrast, for many small excluded\nsolutes, such as naturally occurring osmolytes, the mechanism is dominated by\nfavorable enthalpy, whereas the entropic contribution is typically unfavorable.\nWe review the available models for these thermodynamic mechanisms, and comment\non the need for new models that would be able to explain the full range of\nobserved depletion forces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Oct 2013 11:22:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Nov 2013 13:12:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-15"}

It describes how\nspecies distribute and perform in response to environmental changes. Ecological\nprocesses and structures are highly complex and adaptive. In order to quantify\nemerging ecological patterns and investigate their hidden mechanisms, we need\nto rely on the simplicity of mathematical language. This becomes especially\napparent when dealing with scaling patterns in ecology. Indeed, nearly all of\necological patterns are scale dependent. Such scale dependence hampers our\npredictive power and creates problems in our inference. This challenge calls\nfor a clear and fundamental understanding of how and why ecological patterns\nchange across scales. As Simon Levin stated in his MacArthur Award lecture, the\nproblem of relating phenomena across scales is the central problem in ecology\nand other natural sciences. It has become clear that there is currently a drive\nin ecology and complexity science to develop new quantitative approaches that\nare suitable for analysing and forecasting patterns of ecological systems. Here\nI provide a road map for future works on synthesizing the scaling patterns in\necology, aiming (i) to collect and sort a diverse array of ecological patterns,\n(ii) to present the dominant parametric forms of how these patterns change\nacross spatial and temporal scales, (iii) to detect the processes and\nmechanisms using mathematical models, and finally (iv) to probe the physical\nmeaning of these scaling patterns. This road map is divided into three parts\nand covers three main concepts of scale in ecology: heterogeneity, hierarchy\nand size. Using scale as a thread, this road map and its following works weave\nthe kaleidoscope of ecological scaling patterns into a cohesive whole.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Oct 2013 12:20:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-09"}

In\nparticular, we consider a chain of Curie-Weiss models that are coupled by\ninteractions up to a certain range. Indeed, it is well known that the pure\n(uncoupled) Curie-Weiss model undergoes a first order phase transition driven\nby the magnetic field, and furthermore, in the spinodal region such systems are\nunable to reach equilibrium in sub-exponential time if initialized in the\nmetastable state. By contrast, the spatially coupled system is, instead, able\nto reach the equilibrium even when initialized to the metastable state. The\nequilibrium phase propagates along the chain in the form of a travelling wave.\nHere we study the speed of the wave-front and the so-called `termination\ncost'--- \\textit{i.e.}, the conditions necessary for the propagation to occur.\nWe reach several interesting conclusions about optimization of the speed and\nthe cost.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Oct 2013 13:03:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-04"}

Their violation has been taken as\nevidence that quantum theory lacks a `realistic' formulation. However in\naddition to realism the derivation of the Leggett-Garg inequalities relies on\nanother, more obscure assumption of `non-invasive measurability.' The\nsignificance of this assumption and the consequences for the interpretation of\nviolations of the Leggett-Garg inequalities have been hotly debated. In this\npaper we present a pedagogical introduction to the issues, focussing on the\nsignificance of non-invasive measurability. We give a simple derivation of the\nLeggett-Garg inequalities paying particular attention to where and when the two\nassumptions are used, and we give an example of a realist but not\nnon-invasively measurable hidden variable theory which violates them.

In the low-density outskirts of halos the scalar field value can\napproach the symmetry breaking value and leads to significantly different\nvalues of {\\alpha}. If the scalar-photon coupling strength {\\beta}{\\gamma} is\nof order unity we find that the variation of {\\alpha} inside dark matter halos\ncan be of the same magnitude as the recent claims by Webb et al. of a dipole\nvariation. Importantly, our results also show that with low-redshift symmetry\nbreaking these models exhibit some dependence of {\\alpha} on lookback time (as\nopposed to a pure spatial dipole) which could in principle be detected by\nsufficiently accurate spectroscopic measurements, such as those of ALMA and the\nELT-HIRES.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Oct 2013 14:31:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-29"}

Several\nstudies have shown that the formation of protostellar discs in collapsing\nclouds is severely hampered by the braking torque exerted by the entrained\nmagnetic field on the infalling gas, as long as the field remains frozen to the\ngas. We examine the possibility that the concentration and twisting of the\nfield lines in the inner region of collapse can produce a significant reduction\nof the ionisation fraction. To check whether the CR ionisation rate (CRir) can\nfall below the critical value required to maintain good coupling, we first\nstudy the propagation of CRs in a model of a static magnetised cloud varying\nthe relative strength of the toroidal/poloidal components and the mass-to-flux\nratio. We then follow the path of CRs using realistic magnetic field\nconfigurations generated by numerical simulations of a rotating collapsing\ncore. We find that an increment of the toroidal component of the magnetic\nfield, or, in general, a more twisted configuration of the field lines, results\nin a decrease in the CR flux. This is mainly due to the magnetic mirroring\neffect that is stronger where larger variations in the field direction are\npresent. In particular, we find a decrease of the CRir below 10^-18 s-1 in the\ncentral 300-400 AU, where density is higher than about 10^9 cm-3. This very low\nvalue of the CRir is attained in the cases of intermediate and low\nmagnetisation (mass-to-flux ratio lambda=5 and 17, respectively) and for\ntoroidal fields larger than about 40% of the total field. Magnetic field\neffects can significantly reduce the ionisation fraction in collapsing clouds.\nWe provide a handy fitting formula to compute approximately the attenuation of\nthe CRir in a molecular cloud as a function of the density and the magnetic\nconfiguration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Oct 2013 14:43:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 Dec 2013 13:51:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

It is also well known that community structure (the\nexistence of relatively densely connected groups of vertices) in contact\nnetworks influences the spread of disease. We propose a set of local strategies\nfor social distancing, based on community structure, that can be employed in\nthe event of an epidemic to reduce the epidemic size. Unlike most social\ndistancing methods, ours do not require individuals to know the disease state\n(infected or susceptible, etc.) of others, and we do not make the unrealistic\nassumption that the structure of the entire contact network is known. Instead,\nthe recommended behavior change is based only on an individual's local view of\nthe network. Each individual avoids contact with a fraction of his/her\ncontacts, using knowledge of his/her local network to decide which contacts\nshould be avoided. If the behavior change occurs only when an individual\nbecomes ill or aware of the disease, these strategies can substantially reduce\nepidemic size with a relatively small cost, measured by the number of contacts\navoided.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Oct 2013 15:10:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-09"}

While it is usually agreed that single-degenerate progenitor\nsystems would be luminous supersoft X-ray sources (SSSs), it was recently\nsuggested that double-degenerate progenitors might also go through a SSS phase.\nAims: We aim to examine the possibility of double-degenerate progenitor systems\nbeing SSSs, and place stringent upper limits on the maximally possible\ndurations of any SSS phases and expected number of these systems in a galactic\npopulation. Method: We employ the binary population synthesis code SeBa to\nexamine the mass-transfer characteristics of a possible SSS phase of\ndouble-degenerate type Ia SN progenitor systems for 1) the standard SeBa\nassumptions, and 2) an optimistic best-case scenario. The latter case\nestablishes firm upper limits on the possible population of supersoft source\ndouble-degenerate type Ia SN progenitor systems. Results: Our results indicate\nthat unlike what is expected for single-degenerate progenitor systems, the vast\nmajority of the material accreted by either pure wind mass transfer or a\ncombination of wind and RLOF mass transfer is helium rather than hydrogen. Even\nwith extremely optimistic assumptions concerning the mass-transfer and\nretention efficiencies, the average mass accreted by systems that eventually\nbecome double-degenerate type Ia SNe is small. Consequently, the lengths of\ntime that these systems may be SSSs are short, even under optimal conditions,\nand the expected number of such systems in a galactic population is negligible.\nConclusions: The population of double-degenerate type Ia SN progenitors that\nare SSSs is at least an order of magnitude smaller than the population of\nsingle-degenerate progenitors expected to be SSSs, and the supersoft X-ray\nbehaviour of double-degenerate systems typically ceases long before the SN\nexplosions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Oct 2013 15:12:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-05"}

We consider\nmodulations of mass captured by the compact object from the companion star's\nstellar wind in binaries with late type giants, systems which usually have long\norbital periods. We show that a hydrodynamical interaction of the wind matter\nwithin a binary system even without eccentricity results in variability of the\nmass accretion rate with characteristic time-scales close to the orbital\nperiod. The cause of the variability is an undeveloped turbulent motion\n(perturbed motion without significant vorticity) of wind matter near the\ncompact object.

Within the context of this picture, significant\norbital obliquities characteristic of a substantial fraction of such planets\ncan be attributed to external torques that perturb the disks out of alignment\nwith the spin axes of their host stars. Therefore, the acquisition of orbital\nobliquity exhibits sensitive dependence on the physics of disk-star\ninteractions. Here, we analyze the primordial excitation of spin-orbit\nmisalignment of Sun-like stars, in light of disk-star angular momentum\ntransfer. We begin by calculating the stellar pre-main sequence rotational\nevolution, accounting for spin-up due to gravitational contraction and\naccretion as well as spin-down due to magnetic star-disk coupling. We devote\nparticular attention to angular momentum transfer by accretion, and show that\nwhile generally subdominant to gravitational contraction, this process is\nlargely controlled by the morphology of the stellar magnetic field (i.e.\nspecific angular momentum accreted by stars with octupole-dominated surface\nfields is smaller than that accreted by dipole-dominated stars by an order of\nmagnitude). Subsequently, we examine the secular spin-axis dynamics of\ndisk-bearing stars, accounting for the time-evolution of stellar and disk\nproperties and demonstrate that misalignments are preferentially excited in\nsystems where stellar rotation is not overwhelmingly rapid. Moreover, we show\nthat the excitation of spin-orbit misalignment occurs impulsively, through an\nencounter with a resonance between the stellar precession frequency and the\ndisk-torquing frequency. Cumulatively, the model developed herein opens up a\npreviously unexplored avenue towards understanding star-disk evolution and its\nconsequences in a unified manner.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Oct 2013 15:42:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

The construction we\npresent here is reminiscent of the isobar cut in the pressure-volume plane\nwhich eliminates un-physical part of the Van der Walls curves below the\ncritical temperature. Our construction also modifies the Hawking-Page phase\ntransition. Stable black holes are formed at the temperature T > T*, while pure\nradiation persists for T< T*. T* turns out to be below the standard\nHawking-Page temperature and there are no unstable black holes as in the usual\nscenario.

In order\nto improve the current clinical procedures for atrial reentry by understanding\nits mechanism, geometrical analysis is proposed on the conditions of conduction\nfailure at the PVs and is validated by various computational modeling. To\nachieve this, a new analytic approach is proposed by adapting the geometric\nrelative acceleration analysis from spacetime physics on the hypothesis that a\nlarge relative acceleration can translate to a dramatic increase in the\ncurvature of the wavefront and subsequently to conduction failure. This\nanalytic method is applied to a simplified model of the PV to reveal the strong\ndependency of the propagational direction and the magnitude of anisotropy for\nconduction failure. The unidirectionality of the PVs follows directly and is\nvalidated by computational tests in a T-shaped domain, computational\nsimulations for three-dimensional atrial reentry and previous in-silico reports\nfor atrial reentry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Oct 2013 13:50:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-10"}

Immediately\nafter patient irradiation, PET scanners can be used to measure the spatial\ndistribution of positron emitters, which can track the carbon beam to the\ntissue. In this study, we designed and evaluated an dual-plate in-room PET\nscanner to monitor patient dose in carbon ion therapy, which is based on GATE\nsimulation platform. A dual-plate PET is designed to avoid interference with\nthe carbon beam line and with patient positioning. Its performance was compared\nwith that of four-head and full-ring PET scanners. The dual-plate, four-head\nand full-ring PET scanners consisted of 30, 60, 60 detector modules,\nrespectively, with a 36 cm distance between directly opposite detector modules\nfor dose deposition measurements.

The proposed algorithm accomplishes this by computing a\nfast preview from the blocks, whose purpose is twofold. On one hand, it allows\nto enforce a set of constraints to drive the reconstruction algorithm towards a\nsmooth solution, imposing the similarity of block borders.
