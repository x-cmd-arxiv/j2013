The mesh\nmotion can be computed by choosing among three different node solvers, which\nare for the first time compared with each other in this article: the node\nvelocity may be obtained i) either as an arithmetic average among the states\nsurrounding the node, or, ii) as a solution of multiple one-dimensional\nhalf-Riemann problems around a vertex, or, iii) by solving approximately a\nmultidimensional Riemann problem around each vertex of the mesh using the\ngenuinely multidimensional HLL Riemann.

The method of generalized compensated\nderivatives is natural and powerful, and its underlying structure has a simple\nand intuitively appealing geometric interpretation. Several extensions of the\nmain theorem such as envelope relations, symmetry properties and invariance\nconditions, transformations of decision variables and parameters, degrees of\narbitrariness in the choice of comparative statics results, and rank relations\nand inequalities are developed.

After not finding many age-related\ngenes in some of the analyzed tissue types, the study was criticized for having\nlow power. It is possible that the low power is due to the presence of\nimportant unmeasured variables, and indeed we find that a latent factor model\nappears to explain substantial variability not captured by measured covariates.\nWe propose including the estimated latent factors in a multiple regression\nmodel. The key difficulty in doing so is assigning appropriate degrees of\nfreedom to the estimated factors to obtain unbiased error variance estimators\nand enable valid hypothesis testing. When the number of responses is large\nrelative to the sample size, treating the estimated factors like observed\ncovariates leads to a downward bias in the variance estimates. Many ad-hoc\nsolutions to this problem have been proposed in the literature without the\nbackup of a careful theoretical analysis. Using recent results from random\nmatrix theory, we derive a simple, easy to use expression for degrees of\nfreedom. Our estimate gives a principled alternative to ad-hoc approaches in\ncommon use.

Diachronic tasks recruited alpha as well, in\naddition to lateral mu rhythms and the newly discovered nu and kappa rhythms\nwhose functional significance is still unclear. Social coordination,\nobservation, and delayed imitation share commonality of context: in our\nexperiments, subjects exchanged information through visual perception and moved\nin similar ways. Nonetheless, there was little overlap between the neuromarkers\nrecruited for synchronic and diachronic tasks, a result that hints strongly of\ntask-specific neural mechanisms for social behaviors.

These applications\nrequire measuring and differentiating the visibility of an object (target) from\ndifferent viewpoints in a dataspace, e.g., a billboard may be seen from two\nviewpoints but is readable only from the viewpoint closer to the target. In\nthis paper, we formulate the above problem of quantifying the visibility of\n(from) a target object from (of) the surrounding area with a visibility color\nmap (VCM). A VCM is essentially defined as a surface color map of the space,\nwhere each viewpoint of the space is assigned a color value that denotes the\nvisibility measure of the target from that viewpoint. Measuring the visibility\nof a target even from a single viewpoint is an expensive operation, as we need\nto consider factors such as distance, angle, and obstacles between the\nviewpoint and the target. Hence, a straightforward approach to construct the\nVCM that requires visibility computation for every viewpoint of the surrounding\nspace of the target, is prohibitively expensive in terms of both I/Os and\ncomputation, especially for a real dataset comprising of thousands of\nobstacles. We propose an efficient approach to compute the VCM based on a key\nproperty of the human vision that eliminates the necessity of computing the\nvisibility for a large number of viewpoints of the space. To further reduce the\ncomputational overhead, we propose two approximations; namely, minimum bounding\nrectangle and tangential approaches with guaranteed error bounds. Our extensive\nexperiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our solutions to\nconstruct the VCM for real 2D and 3D datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Oct 2013 02:38:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-29"}

Two factors contribute to the speed of finding the optimal solution by\nthe MCMC detector: the probability of the optimal solution in the stationary\ndistribution, and the mixing time of the MCMC detector. Firstly, we compute the\noptimal value of the \"temperature\" parameter, in the sense that the temperature\nhas the desirable property that once the Markov chain has mixed to its\nstationary distribution, there is polynomially small probability\n($1/\\mbox{poly}(N)$, instead of exponentially small) of encountering the\noptimal solution. This temperature is shown to be at most\n$O(\\sqrt{SNR}/\\ln(N))$, where $SNR$ is the signal-to-noise ratio, and $N$ is\nthe problem dimension. Secondly, we study the mixing time of the underlying\nMarkov chain of the proposed MCMC detector. We find that, the mixing time of\nMCMC is closely related to whether there is a local minimum in the lattice\nstructures of ILS problems. For some lattices without local minima, the mixing\ntime of the Markov chain is independent of $SNR$, and grows polynomially in the\nproblem dimension; for lattices with local minima, the mixing time grows\nunboundedly as $SNR$ grows, when the temperature is set, as in conventional\nwisdom, to be the standard deviation of noises. Our results suggest that, to\nensure fast mixing for a fixed dimension $N$, the temperature for MCMC should\ninstead be set as $\\Omega(\\sqrt{SNR})$ in general. Simulation results show that\nthe optimized MCMC detector efficiently achieves approximately ML detection in\nMIMO systems having a huge number of transmit and receive dimensions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Oct 2013 03:51:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

Polysilicon\n(poly-Si) is an ideal platform because it is dopable and semi-conducting and\ncan be deposited and patterned easily on a wide range of low cost substrates.\nHowever, the lack of crystalline coherency in poly-Si poses an immense\nchallenge for high-quality epitaxial growth. In this work, we demonstrate, for\nthe first time, direct growth of micron-sized InGaAs/GaAs nanopillars on\npolysilicon. Transmission electron microscopy shows that the micron-sized\npillars are single-crystalline and single Wurzite-phase, far exceeding the\nsubstrate crystal grain size ~100nm. The high quality growth is enabled by the\nunique tapering geometry at the base of the nanostructure, which reduces the\neffective InGaAs/Si contact area to < 40 nm in diameter. The small footprint\nnot only reduces stress due to lattice mismatch but also prevents the\nnanopillar from nucleating on multiple Si crystal grains. This relaxes the\ngrain size requirement for poly-Si, potentially reducing the cost for poly-Si\ndeposition. Lasing is achieved in the as-grown pillars under optical pumping,\nattesting their excellent crystalline and optical quality.

The proposed transformation reduces a multidimensional\nintegral representation of the CRLB to an expression involving an infinite sum.\nStochastic models used in this paper assume additive noise in both the\nobservation and transmission channels. Two cases of data transmission are\nconsidered. The first case assumes a linear analog modulation of raw\nobservations prior to their transmission to a fusion center. In the second\ncase, each sensor quantizes its observation to $M$ levels, and the quantized\ndata are communicated to a fusion center. In both cases, parallel additive\nwhite Gaussian channels are assumed.

The aim of this paper is to study deuterated water in the solar-type\nprotostars NGC1333 IRAS4A and IRAS4B, to compare their HDO abundance\ndistribution with other star-forming regions, and to constrain their HDO/H2O\nratios. Methods. Using the Herschel/HIFI instrument as well as ground-based\ntelescopes, we observed several HDO lines covering a large excitation range\n(Eup/k=22-168 K) towards these protostars and an outflow position. Non-LTE\nradiative transfer codes were then used to determine the HDO abundance profiles\nin these sources. Results. The HDO fundamental line profiles show a very broad\ncomponent, tracing the molecular outflows, in addition to a narrower emission\ncomponent and a narrow absorbing component. In the protostellar envelope of\nNGC1333 IRAS4A, the HDO inner (T>100 K) and outer (T<100 K) abundances with\nrespect to H2 are estimated at 7.5x10^{-9} and 1.2x10^{-11}, respectively,\nwhereas, in NGC1333 IRAS4B, they are 1.0x10^{-8} and 1.2x10^{-10},\nrespectively. Similarly to the low-mass protostar IRAS16293-2422, an absorbing\nouter layer with an enhanced abundance of deuterated water is required to\nreproduce the absorbing components seen in the fundamental lines at 465 and 894\nGHz in both sources. This water-rich layer is probably extended enough to\nencompass the two sources as well as parts of the outflows. In the outflows\nemanating from NGC1333 IRAS4A, the HDO column density is estimated at about\n(2-4)x10^{13} cm^{-2}, leading to an abundance of about (0.7-1.9)x10^{-9}. An\nHDO/H2O ratio between 7x10^{-4} and 9x10^{-2} is derived in the outflows. In\nthe warm inner regions of these two sources, we estimate the HDO/H2O ratios at\nabout 1x10^{-4}-4x10^{-3}. This ratio seems higher (a few %) in the cold\nenvelope of IRAS4A, whose possible origin is discussed in relation to formation\nprocesses of HDO and H2O.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Oct 2013 10:29:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 8 Nov 2013 10:41:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 5 Dec 2013 11:48:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

The parton\nenergy loss, which is sensitive to the transport coefficients of the produced\nmedium, can be studied experimentally by measuring the nuclear modication\nfactor ($R_{\\rm AA}$) which accounts for the modication of the heavy-flavoured\nhadron yield in Pb-Pb collisions with respect to pp collisions.

This is induced by the dragging of the flux by the accreting\ngas. The other is the outward diffusion timescale of the magnetic flux\ntau_{dif}. We consider diffusion due to the Ohmic resistivity.

An\ninteresting question is: when is a given connected normal digraph\ndistance-regular? Motivated by this question first we give some\ncharacterizations of weakly distance-regular digraphs. Specially we show that\nwhether a given connected digraph to be weakly distance-regular only depends on\nthe equality for two invariants. Then we show that a connected normal digraph\n$\\G$ with $d+1$ distinct eigenvalues is distance-regular if and only if the\nsimple excess (the ratio of the square of mean of the numbers of shortest paths\nbetween vertices at distance $d$ to the mean of the numbers of vertices at\ndistance $d$ from every vertex, which is zero if $d$ is greater than the\ndiameter) is equal to the spectral excess (a number which can be computed from\nthe spectrum of $\\G$). In fact, this result is a new variation (a simple\nvariation) of the spectral excess theorem due to Fiol and Garigga for connected\nnormal digraphs. Using these results we derive another variation (a weighted\nvariation) of the spectral excess theorem for connected normal digraphs.\nDistance regularity of a digraph (also a graph) is in general not determined by\nits spectrum. For application of the simple variation we show that distance\nregularity of a connected normal digraph $\\G$ (with $d+1$ distinct eigenvalues)\nis determined by its spectrum and the invariant $\\delta_d$ (the mean of the\nnumbers of vertices at distance $d$ from every vertex).

The accuracy with\nwhich the location of the source on the sky can be inferred from gravitational\nwave data is a limiting factor for several potential scientific goals of\ngravitational-wave astronomy, including multi-messenger observations. Various\nmethods have been used to estimate the ability of a proposed network to\nlocalize sources. Here we compare two techniques for predicting the uncertainty\nof sky localization -- timing triangulation and the Fisher information matrix\napproximations -- with Bayesian inference on the full, coherent data set. We\nfind that timing triangulation alone tends to over-estimate the uncertainty in\nsky localization by a median factor of $4$ for a set of signals from\nnon-spinning compact object binaries ranging up to a total mass of $20\nM_\\odot$, and the over-estimation increases with the mass of the system. We\nfind that average predictions can be brought to better agreement by the\ninclusion of phase consistency information in timing-triangulation techniques.\nHowever, even after corrections, these techniques can yield significantly\ndifferent results to the full analysis on specific mock signals. Thus, while\nthe approximate techniques may be useful in providing rapid, large scale\nestimates of network localization capability, the fully coherent Bayesian\nanalysis gives more robust results for individual signals, particularly in the\npresence of detector noise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Oct 2013 15:16:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

We assume\na two-groups normal mixture model for the data and consider the asymptotic\nframework adopted in Bogdan et al.

The matching is between the quasi-distribution\ndefined by static correlation at finite nucleon momentum and the light-cone\ndistribution measurable in experiments. The result is useful for extracting the\nlatter from the former in a lattice QCD calculation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Oct 2013 15:59:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-13"}

The generation of\nthese gait patterns has been the subject of debate for a long time. We propose\na coupled oscillator model that is coupled with the physical interactions of\nthe body. The results of this study showed that the gait pattern transitions\nspontaneously to walking/trotting/pacing/bounding in manner similar to that of\nreal quadruped animals when the resonating portion of the body is changed\naccording to the speed of leg movement. We also observed that pacing is\nexpressed exclusively instead of trotting by changing the physical\ncharacteristics. In addition to leading to understanding of the principles of\nlocomotion in living things, the coupled oscillator model proposed in this\nstudy is expected to lead to the creation of a legged robot that can select an\nenergy-efficient gait and transition to it spontaneously.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Oct 2013 08:59:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-30"}
