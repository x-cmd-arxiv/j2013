The three-dimensional\n(3D) airway geometry beginning from the mouth to about 7 generations of airways\nis reconstructed from the multi-detector row computed tomography (MDCT) image\nat the total lung capacity (TLC). Along with the segmented lobe surfaces, we\ncan build an anatomically-consistent one-dimensional (1D) airway tree spanning\nover more than 20 generations down to the terminal bronchioles, which is\nspecific to the CT resolved airways and lobes (J Biomech 43(11): 2159-2163,\n2010). We then register two lung images at TLC and the functional residual\ncapacity (FRC) to specify subject-specific CFD flow boundary conditions and\ndeform the airway surface mesh for a breathing lung simulation (J Comput Phys\n244:168-192, 2013).

With the goal of\nunderstanding the physical state, origin, and evolution of the gas in young\ndebris disks, we obtained CO line observations with the Atacama Large\nMillimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). Here we report on the detection of 12CO\nand 13CO in the J=2-1 and J=3-2 transitions and C18O in the J=2-1 line. The gas\nexhibits a Keplerian velocity curve, one of the few direct measurements of\nKeplerian rotation in young debris disks. The measured CO brightness\ndistribution could be reproduced by a simple star+disk system, whose parameters\nare r_in < 26 AU, r_out = 138 +/- 20 AU, M_*=1.8 +0.5 -0.2 M_Sun, and i = 32.6\n+/- 3.1 degrees. The total CO mass, as calculated from the optically thin C18O\nline, is about (4-8) x 10^-2 M_Earth, while the CO line ratios suggest a\nradiation temperature on the order of 6-9 K. Comparing our results with those\nobtained for the dust component of the HD 21997 disk from the ALMA continuum\nobservations by Mo\\'or et al., we conclude that comparable amounts of CO gas\nand dust are present in the disk. Interestingly, the gas and dust in the HD\n21997 system are not co-located, indicating a dust-free inner gas disk within\n55 AU of the star. We explore two possible scenarios for the origin of the gas.\nA secondary origin, which involves gas production from colliding or active\nplanetesimals, would require unreasonably high gas production rates and would\nnot explain why the gas and dust are not co-located. We propose that HD 21997\nis a hybrid system where secondary debris dust and primordial gas coexist. HD\n21997, whose age exceeds both the model predictions for disk clearing and the\nages of the oldest T Tauri-like or transitional gas disks in the literature,\nmay be a key object linking the primordial and the debris phases of disk\nevolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Oct 2013 16:00:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

Geometrically, this implies allowing arbitrary signal\ndistortions in an $n$-dimensional rectangle defined by the\n$\\varepsilon$-insensitivity zone in each dimension of the selected image\nrepresentation domain. Unfortunately, not every image representation domain is\nwell-suited for such a simple, scalar-wise, approach because statistical and/or\nperceptual interactions between the coefficients may exist. These interactions\nimply that scalar approaches may induce distortions that do not follow the\nimage statistics and/or are perceptually annoying. Taking into account these\nrelations would imply using non-rectangular $\\varepsilon$-insensitivity regions\n(allowing coupled distortions in different coefficients), which is beyond the\nconventional SVM formulation.\n  In this paper, we report a condition on the suitable domain for developing\nefficient SVM image coding schemes. We analytically demonstrate that no linear\ndomain fulfills this condition because of the statistical and perceptual\ninter-coefficient relations that exist in these domains. This theoretical\nresult is experimentally confirmed by comparing SVM learning in previously\nreported linear domains and in a recently proposed non-linear perceptual domain\nthat simultaneously reduces the statistical and perceptual relations (so it is\ncloser to fulfilling the proposed condition).

In Nov 2010 an experiment\nwith a prototype of a Laser Frequency Comb (LFC) calibration system was\nperformed with the HARPS spectrograph of the 3.6m ESO telescope at La Silla\nduring which high signal-to-noise spectra of the Moon were obtained. We exploit\nthose Echelle spectra to study the optical integrated solar spectrum . The\nDAOSPEC program is used to measure solar line positions through gaussian\nfitting in an automatic way. We first apply the LFC solar spectrum to\ncharacterize the CCDs of the HARPS spectrograph. The comparison of the LFC and\nTh-Ar calibrated spectra reveals S-type distortions on each order along the\nwhole spectral range with an amplitude of +/-40 m/s. This confirms the pattern\nfound by Wilken et al. (2010) on a single order and extends the detection of\nthe distortions to the whole analyzed region revealing that the precise shape\nvaries with wavelength. A new data reduction is implemented to deal with CCD\npixel inequalities to obtain a wavelength corrected solar spectrum. By using\nthis spectrum we provide a new LFC calibrated solar atlas with 400 line\npositions in the range of 476-530, and 175 lines in the 534-585 nm range. The\nnew LFC atlas improves the accuracy of individual lines by a significant factor\nreaching a mean value of about 10 m/s. The LFC--based solar line wavelengths\nare essentially free of major instrumental effects and provide a reference for\nabsolute solar line positions. We suggest that future LFC observations could be\nused to trace small radial velocity changes of the whole solar photospheric\nspectrum in connection with the solar cycle and for direct comparison with the\npredicted line positions of 3D radiative hydrodynamical models of the solar\nphotosphere.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Oct 2013 16:42:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

This is particularly true for vector-borne infectious\ndiseases, like malaria, which is a major source of morbidity and mortality in\nhumans. Understanding the mechanistic links between environment and population\nprocesses for these diseases is key to predicting the consequences of climate\nchange on transmission and for developing effective interventions. An important\nmeasure of the intensity of disease transmission is the reproductive number\n$R_0$. However, understanding the mechanisms linking $R_0$ and temperature, an\nenvironmental factor driving disease risk, can be challenging because the data\navailable for parameterization are often poor. To address this we show how a\nBayesian approach can help identify critical uncertainties in components of\n$R_0$ and how this uncertainty is propagated into the estimate of $R_0$. Most\nnotably, we find that different parameters dominate the uncertainty at\ndifferent temperature regimes: bite rate from 15-25$^\\circ$ C; fecundity across\nall temperatures, but especially $\\sim$25-32$^\\circ$ C; mortality from\n20-30$^\\circ$ C; parasite development rate at $\\sim$15-16$^\\circ$C and again at\n$\\sim$33-35$^\\circ$C. Focusing empirical studies on these parameters and\ncorresponding temperature ranges would be the most efficient way to improve\nestimates of $R_0$.

We show that\nif an asymptotically flat 3-manifold (M,g) of nonnegative scalar curvature\ncontains a non-compact, properly embedded minimal surface which is stable and\nhas quadratic area growth, then it is isometric to the flat R^{3}. This\nimplies, for instance, that in presence of a positive ADM mass any sequence of\nsolutions to the Plateau problem with diverging boundaries can never have\nuniform height bounds, even at a single point. The proof of this theorem is\nbased on a characterization of finite index minimal surfaces, on classical\ninfinitesimal rigidity results by Fischer-Colbrie and Schoen and on the\npositive mass theorem by Schoen-Yau. More specifically, we also show that a\ncomplete minimal surface of finite index inside an asymptotically flat\n3-manifold has finitely many ends and each of these is a graph of a function\nthat has a suitable expansion at infinity, in analogy with a classical result\nby Schoen for Euclidean spaces. In addition, we prove that a non-compact stable\nMOTS in an initial data set (M,g,k) is conformally diffeomorphic to either the\nplane C or to the cylinder A and in the latter case infinitesimal rigidity\nholds. If the data have harmonic asymptotics, the former case is also proven to\nbe globally rigid in the sense that the presence of a stable MOTS forces an\nisometric embedding of (M,g,k) in the Minkowski space-time (\\mathbb{M},\\eta) as\na space-like slice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Oct 2013 18:20:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Apr 2014 02:11:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-08"}

The scalar degree of freedom is hidden in\nhigh-density environments because the effective mass of the chameleon scalar\ndepends on the trace of the stress-energy tensor. In the early Universe, when\nthe trace of the matter stress-energy tensor is nearly zero, the chameleon is\nvery light, and Hubble friction prevents it from reaching the minimum of its\neffective potential. Whenever a particle species becomes non-relativistic,\nhowever, the trace of the stress-energy tensor is temporarily nonzero, and the\nchameleon begins to roll. We show that these \"kicks\" to the chameleon field\nhave catastrophic consequences for chameleon gravity. The velocity imparted to\nthe chameleon by the kick is sufficiently large that the chameleon's mass\nchanges rapidly as it slides past its potential minimum. This nonadiabatic\nevolution shatters the chameleon field by generating extremely high-energy\nperturbations through quantum particle production. If the chameleon's coupling\nto matter is slightly stronger than gravitational, the excited modes have\ntrans-Planckian momenta. The production of modes with momenta exceeding 1e7 GeV\ncan only be avoided for small couplings and finely tuned initial conditions.\nThese quantum effects also significantly alter the background evolution of the\nchameleon field, and we develop new analytic and numerical techniques to treat\nquantum particle production in the regime of strong dissipation.

To do this, two classes of massive (M* >= 10^10.5 Msun) galaxy are\nselected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the Munich semi-analytic\nmodel of galaxy formation, L-Galaxies. The first class is selected by high\nspecific star formation rates (sSFR) and high Zg, and the second class by low\nsSFR and low Zg. These criteria roughly distinguish disc-dominant galaxies from\nmetal-poor, elliptical galaxies. In the semi-analytic model, the second class\nof galaxies obtain low sSFR and low Zg due to gradual dilution of the\ninterstellar medium by accretion of metal-poor gas via infalling clumps and\nlow-mass satellites. This occurs after a merger-induced starburst and the\nassociated supernova feedback have quenched most of the original gas reservoir.\nA number of signatures of this evolution are present in these model galaxies at\nz=0, including low gas fractions, large central black holes, elliptical\nmorphologies, old ages, and importantly, low (Zg-Z*) indicating dilution after\nstar formation. Remarkably, all of these properties are also found in low-sSFR,\nlow-Zg, massive galaxies in the SDSS-DR7. This provides strong, indirect\nevidence that some elliptical galaxies are undergoing gradual dilution after a\ngas-rich merger in the local Universe.

Several\nstudies have shown that a \"heavy\" IMF (e.g., with a Salpeter-like abundance of\nlow mass stars and thus normalisation) is preferred for massive early-type\ngalaxies, while this IMF is inconsistent with the properties of less massive,\nlater-type galaxies. These discoveries motivate the hypothesis that the IMF may\nvary (possibly very slightly) across galaxies and across components of\nindividual galaxies (e.g. bulges vs discs). In this paper we use a sample of 19\nlate-type strong gravitational lenses from the SWELLS survey to investigate the\nIMFs of the bulges and discs in late-type galaxies. We perform a joint analysis\nof the galaxies' total masses (constrained by strong gravitational lensing) and\nstellar masses (constrained by optical and near-infrared colours in the context\nof a stellar population synthesis [SPS] model, up to an IMF normalisation\nparameter). Using minimal assumptions apart from the physical constraint that\nthe total stellar mass within any aperture must be less than the total mass\nwithin the aperture, we find that the bulges of the galaxies cannot have IMFs\nheavier (i.e. implying high mass per unit luminosity) than Salpeter, while the\ndisc IMFs are not well constrained by this data set. We also discuss the\nnecessity for hierarchical modelling when combining incomplete information\nabout multiple astronomical objects. This modelling approach allows us to place\nupper limits on the size of any departures from universality. More data,\nincluding spatially resolved kinematics (as in paper V) and stellar population\ndiagnostics over a range of bulge and disc masses, are needed to robustly\nquantify how the IMF varies within galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Oct 2013 22:26:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

The exact analytical expressions for the grand\npotential and hence for several thermodynamic quantities have been obtained for\nthis purpose in both uniform and trapped cases. It is enunciated that many\ninteresting features of spin-orbit coupled systems revealed theoretically can\nbe understood in terms of coupling-induced modifications in statistical\ninterparticle potential. The temperature-dependence of the chemical potential,\nspecific heat and isothermal compressibility for a uniform Bose gas is found to\nhave signature of the incipient Bose-Einstein condensation in very weak\ncoupling regime although the system does not really go in the Bose-condensed\nphase. The transition temperature in harmonically trapped case decreases with\nincrease of coupling strength consistent with the weakening of the statistical\nattractive interaction. Anomalous behavior of some thermodynamic quantities,\npartly akin to that in dimensions less than two, appears for uniform fermions\nas soon as the Fermi level goes down the Dirac point on increasing the coupling\nstrength.

To make the most efficient\nuse of each plug-plate, several observing fields are typically stacked to\nproduce a single plate.

Understanding the\nconditions for invasion in a two-locus model can elucidate these processes. For\ninstance, selection can act differently upon the sexes, or sex-linkage can\nfacilitate the invasion of genetic variation with opposing fitness effects\nbetween the sexes. Two factors that deserve further attention are recombination\nrates and allele frequencies -- both of which can vary substantially between\nthe sexes. We find that sex-specific recombination rates in a two-locus diploid\nmodel can affect the invasion outcome of sexually antagonistic alleles and that\nthe sex-averaged recombination rate is not necessarily sufficient to predict\ninvasion. We confirm that the range of permissible recombination rates is\nsmaller in the sex benefitting from invasion and larger in the sex harmed by\ninvasion. However, within the invasion space, male recombination rate can be\ngreater than, equal to, or less than female recombination rate in order for a\nmale-benefit, female-detriment allele to invade (and similarly for a\nfemale-benefit, male-detriment allele). We further show that a novel, sexually\nantagonistic allele that is also associated with a lowered recombination rate\ncan invade more easily when present in the double heterozygote genotype.\nFinally, we find that sexual dimorphism in resident allele frequencies can\nimpact the invasion of new sexually antagonistic alleles at a second locus. Our\nresults suggest that accounting for sex-specific recombination rates and allele\nfrequencies can determine the difference between invasion and non-invasion of\nnovel sexually antagonistic alleles in a two-locus model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Oct 2013 15:09:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-22"}

The next-to-leading order (NLO) results are already available\nand provide a rather good accuracy. But this precision might be accidental,\nbecause at NLO not all the possible colour exchanges which occur at the\none-loop level are considered and they could have significant impact on the\ncross-section and its differential distributions.
