We find a critical load below which the specific energy of the\nplasma inflowing into the black hole is negative, and above which it is\npositive, and identify two types of flows with distinct properties; at\nsub-critical loads a magnetic outflow is launched from the ergosphere, owing to\nextraction of the black hole spin energy, as originally proposed by Blandford\nand Znajek. At super-critical loads the structure of the flow depends on the\ndetails of the injection process. In cases where the injected plasma is\nrelativistically hot, a pressure driven, double trans-magnetosonic flow is\nlaunched from a stagnation point located outside the ergosphere, between the\ninner and outer light cylinders. Some fraction of the energy deposited in the\nmagnetosphere is then absorbed by the black hole and the rest emerges at\ninfinity in the form of a relativistic outflow. When the injected plasma is\ncold an outflow may not form at all.

This is mainly due to the fact that the nuSnu distribution of\nthe galaxy falls very steeply with increasing frequency (a characteristic that\nis usually indicative of heavy absorption by dust) but shows a silicate feature\nin emission. Such emission features are not expected in sources with\noptical/near-infrared type 2 AGN spectral signatures. The Herschel data show\nthat there is more power emitted in the rest-frame 20-50um wavelength range\ncompared with the model presented by Efstathiou which assumes three components\nof emission: an edge-on torus, clouds (at a temperature of 610 and 200K) that\nare associated with the narrow-line region (NLR) and a highly obscured\nstarburst that dominates in the submillimetre. We present a revised version of\nthat model that assumes an additional component of emission which we associate\nwith NLR clouds at a temperature of 100K. The 100K dust component could also be\nexplained by a highly obscured hot starburst. The model suggests that the NLR\nof IRAS F10214+4724 has an unusually high covering factor (>= 17%) or more\nlikely the magnification of the emission from the NLR clouds is significantly\nhigher than that of the emission from the torus.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Oct 2013 16:12:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

In fact, a\ncomplex magnetic phase-diagram is indeed observed in the isostructural NaFeAs\ncompound.

A comparison of both approaches allows for the\nidentification and determination of the SI terms, which then can be calculated\nand removed from the mean-field results, giving the self-interaction-free\nenergies.

Wind clumping may be the main cause for\nthis discrepancy. In a previous paper, we have presented 3-D Monte-Carlo\ncalculations for the formation of scattering lines in a clumped stellar wind.\nIn the present paper we select five O-type supergiants (from O4 to O7) and test\nwhether the reported discrepancies can be resolved this way. In the first step,\nthe analyses start with simulating the observed spectra with Potsdam Wolf-Rayet\n(PoWR) non-LTE model atmospheres. The mass-loss rates are adjusted to fit best\nto the observed H{\\alpha} emission lines. For the unsaturated UV resonance\nlines (i.e. P v) we then apply our 3-D Monte-Carlo code, which can account for\nwind clumps of any optical depths, a non-void inter-clump medium, and a\nvelocity dispersion inside the clumps. The ionization stratifications and\nunderlying photospheric spectra are adopted from the PoWR models. From fitting\nthe observed resonance line profiles, the properties of the wind clumps are\nconstrained. Our results show that with the mass-loss rates that fit H{\\alpha}\n(and other Balmer and He II lines), the UV resonance lines (especially the\nunsaturated doublet of P v) can also be reproduced without problem when\nmacroclumping is taken into account. There is no need to artificially reduce\nthe mass-loss rates, nor to assume a sub-solar phosphorus abundance or an\nextremely high clumping factor, contrary to what was claimed by other authors.\nThese consistent mass-loss rates are lower by a factor of 1.3 to 2.6, compared\nto the mass-loss rate recipe from Vink et al.

It is therefore crucial to reliably predict their\nobservables. The Effective Field Theory of Large Scale Structures (EFTofLSS)\nprovides a manifestly convergent perturbation theory for the weakly non-linear\nregime of dark matter, where correlation functions are computed in an expansion\nof the wavenumber k of a mode over the wavenumber associated with the\nnon-linear scale k_nl.

One reason for this\n(mild) kinematic bias is that many low-mass subhaloes have apocentres that\nexceed the virial radius of the main host; they are thus excluded from subhalo\nsamples identified within the virial boundary, reducing the number of subhalos\non radial orbits. Two other factors contributing to the difference in orbital\nshape between dark and luminous subhaloes are their dynamical evolution after\ninfall, which affects more markedly low-mass (dark) subhaloes, and a weak\ndependence of ellipticity on the redshift of first infall.

It is hypothesized that C. album seedling recruitment\ntiming and magnitude have adapted to environmental and cropping system\npractices of a locality. Limitations in the habitat (filter 1) were reflected\nin local C. album population recruitment season length. Generally, the duration\nof seedling recruitment of both populations (local; DEN-COM) increased with\ndecreasing latitude, north-to-south. In general, compared to the local\npopulation, DEN-COM recruitment at locations north of Denmark was longer and\nsouth of Denmark was shorter, and ended sooner. Generally, the local cropping\nsystem disturbances (CSD) period increased with decreasing latitude. The total\nduration of the CSD period was over twice as long in the south as that in the\nnorth. Recruitment at each locality possessed seasonal structure (time, number)\nconsisting of 2-4 discrete seasonal cohorts. This may be an adaptive means by\nwhich C. album searches for, and exploits, recruitment opportunity just prior\nto, and after, predictable disturbances. The control of C. album seedling\nemergence is contained in the heteroblastic traits of its locally adapted\nseeds, and is stimulated by a complex interaction of light, heat, water,\nnitrate and oxygen signals inherent in the local environment.

We present results from large- (r=1545au) and small-\n(r=155au) domain, 3D smoothed particle hydrodynamic (SPH) simulations of Eta\nCar's colliding winds for 3 Eta A mass-loss rates (2.4, 4.8, and 8.5 x 10^-4\nM_sun/yr), investigating the effects on the dynamics of the binary wind-wind\ncollision (WWC). These simulations include orbital motion, optically thin\nradiative cooling, and radiative forces. We find that Eta A's mass-loss rate\ngreatly affects the time-dependent hydrodynamics at all spatial scales\ninvestigated. The simulations also show that the post-shock wind of the\ncompanion star (Eta B) switches from the adiabatic to the radiative-cooling\nregime during periastron passage. The SPH simulations together with 1D\nradiative transfer models of Eta A's spectra reveal that a factor of 2 or more\ndrop in Eta A's mass-loss rate should lead to substantial changes in numerous\nmultiwavelength observables. Recent observations are not fully consistent with\nthe model predictions, indicating that any drop in Eta A's mass-loss rate was\nlikely by a factor < 2 and occurred after 2004. We speculate that most of the\nrecent observed changes in Eta Car are due to a small increase in the WWC\nopening angle that produces significant effects because our line-of-sight to\nthe system lies close to the dense walls of the WWC zone. A modest decrease in\nEta A's mass-loss rate may be responsible, but changes in the wind/stellar\nparameters of Eta B cannot yet be fully ruled out.

At 43 GHz, the nuclear structure was imaged on a\nlinear scale under 100 Schwarzschild radii. For the first time, we have\ndiscovered the presence of the extended structure in this nucleus, which is\ndirecting from the radio core in two sides toward northwest/southeast\ndirections. The nuclear structure shows a clear spatial gradient on the radio\nspectra, which is similar to that commonly seen in more luminous AGN with\npowerful relativistic jets. Moreover, the radio core shows a\nfrequency-dependent size with an elongated shape, and the position of the core\nalso tends to be frequency dependent. A set of these new findings provide\nevidence that the central engine of the Sombrero is powering radio jets. Based\non the observed brightness ratio of jet-to-counter jet, core position shift and\nits comparison with a theoretical model, we constrained the following\nfundamental physical parameters for the M 104 jets: (1) the northern side is\nthe approaching jet, whereas the southern side is receding: (2) the inclination\nangle of the jet is relatively close to our line-of-sight, probably less than\n~25degrees: (3) the jet intrinsic velocity is highly sub-relativistic at a\nspeed less than ~0.2c.

As a\nconsequence, the gain function determining the gradient of selection can be a\npolynomial of degree $N-1$. In order to deal with the intricacy of the\nresulting evolutionary dynamics, we make use of the theory of polynomials in\nBernstein form. This theory implies a tight link between the sign pattern of\nthe gains from switching on the one hand and the number and stability\nproperties of the rest points of the replicator dynamics on the other hand.\nWhile this relationship is a general one, it is most informative if gains from\nswitching have at most two sign changes, as it is the case for most\nmulti-player matrix games considered in the literature.

Further examples illustrate how focusing on the sign pattern\nof the gains from switching obviates the need for a more involved analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Oct 2013 21:41:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-03"}

Observations of\nextragalactic proper motions can thus directly reveal the cosmic expansion.\nRelatively static structures such as galaxies or galaxy clusters can\npotentially be used to measure the Hubble constant, and test masses in large\nscale structures can measure the overdensity. Since recession velocities and\nangular separations can be precisely measured, apparent proper motions can also\nprovide geometric distance measurements to static structures. The apparent\nfractional angular compression of static objects is 15 microarcseconds per year\nin the local universe; this motion is modulated by the overdensity in dynamic\nexpansion-decoupled structures.\n  We use the Titov et al. quasar proper motion catalog to examine the pairwise\nproper motion of a sparse network of test masses.

The availability of unprecedented amounts\nof digital data has accelerated research on information diffusion in online\nsocial networks. However, the mechanism of information spreading in online\nsocial networks remains elusive due to the complexity of social interactions\nand rapid change of online social networks. Much of prior work on information\ndiffusion over online social networks has based on empirical and statistical\napproaches. The majority of dynamical models arising from information diffusion\nover online social networks involve ordinary differential equations which only\ndepend on time. In a number of recent papers, the authors propose to use\npartial differential equations(PDEs) to characterize temporal and spatial\npatterns of information diffusion over online social networks. Built on\nintuitive cyber-distances such as friendship hops in online social networks,\nthe reaction-diffusion equations take into account influences from various\nexternal out-of-network sources, such as the mainstream media, and provide a\nnew analytic framework to study the interplay of structural and topical\ninfluences on information diffusion over online social networks.

Using the\nbasic principles of classical field theory, we show that for the correct\nunderstanding of the problem, one needs to carefully distinguish situations\nwhen the material medium is modeled either as a background on which light\npropagates or as a dynamical part of the total system. In the former case, we\nprove that the (generalized) Belinfante-Rosenfeld (BR) tensor for the\nelectromagnetic field coincides with the Minkowski tensor. We derive a complete\nset of balance equations for this open system and show that the symmetries of\nthe background medium are directly related to the conservation of the Minkowski\nquantities. In particular, for isotropic media, the angular momentum of light\nis conserved despite of the fact that the Minkowski tensor is non-symmetric.\nFor the closed system of light interacting with matter, we model the material\nmedium as a relativistic non-dissipative fluid and we prove that it is always\npossible to express the total BR tensor of the closed system either in the\nAbraham or in the Minkowski separation. However, in the case of dynamical\nmedia, the balance equations have a particularly convenient form in terms of\nthe Abraham tensor. Our results generalize previous attempts and provide a\nfirst principles basis for a unified understanding of the long-standing\nAbraham-Minkowski controversy without ad hoc arguments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Oct 2013 23:15:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 22 Feb 2015 16:45:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-24"}

Solar wind plasma is a\ntypical case of stochastic spatiotemporal distribution of physical magnitudes\nsuch as force fields (B, E) and matter fields (particle and current densities\nor bulk plasma distributions). The results of this study can be understood in\nthe framework of modern theoretical concepts such as non-extensive statistical\nmechanics (Tsallis, 2009), fractal topology (Zelenyi and Milovanov, 2004),\nturbulence theory (Frisch,1996), strange dynamics (Zaslavsky, 2002),\npercolation theory (Milovanov, 1997), anomalous diffusion theory and anomalous\ntransport theory (Milovanov, 2001), fractional dynamics (Tarasov, 2007) and\nnon-equilibrium phase transition theory (Chang, 1992).

Unfortunately, the hardware used to\nimplement these Hamiltonians will be imperfect and limited in its precision.\nEven small perturbations and imprecisions can have profound effects on the\nnature of the ground state. Here we consider an imperfect implementation of\nadiabatic quantum optimization and show that, for a widely applicable random\ncontrol noise model, quantum stabilizer encodings are able to reduce the\neffective noise magnitude and thus improve the likelihood of a successful\ncomputation or simulation. This reduction builds upon two design principles:\nsummation of equivalent logical operators to increase the energy scale of the\nencoded optimization problem, and the inclusion of a penalty term comprising\nthe sum of the code stabilizer elements. We illustrate our findings with an\nIsing ladder and show that classical repetition coding drastically increases\nthe probability that the ground state of a perturbed model is decodable to that\nof the unperturbed model, while using only realistic two-body interaction.\nFinally, we note that the repetition encoding is a special case of quantum\nstabilizer encodings, and show that this in principle allows us to generalize\nour results to many types of analog quantum information processing, albeit at\nthe expense of many-body interactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Oct 2013 00:18:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-25"}

The\npossible forms (basis states) corresponding to this adaptive function\n(observable) are called eigenstates. The framework incorporates key features of\nexaptation: potentiality, contextuality, nonseparability, and emergence of new\nfeatures. However, since it requires that one enumerate all possible contexts,\nits predictive value is limited, consistent with the assertion that there\nexists no biological equivalent to \"laws of motion\" by which we can predict the\nevolution of the biosphere.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Oct 2013 03:35:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-03"}

Because of the correspondence between cut-free proof nets\nand normal natural deductions, our initial result on product free Lambek\ngrammars can be recovered.\n  We are sad to dedicate the present paper to Philippe Darondeau, with whom we\nstarted to study such questions in Rennes at the beginning of the millennium,\nand who passed away prematurely.\n  We are glad to dedicate the present paper to Jim Lambek for his 90 birthday:\nhe is the living proof that research is an eternal learning process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Oct 2013 06:06:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-03"}

The object 2012 DA14 is a near-Earth asteroid with a size of several\ntens of meters. It had approached closely the Earth on 15 February, 2013 UT,\nproviding an opportunity for precise measurements of this tiny asteroid. Aims.\nThe solar phase angle of 2012 DA14 had varied widely around its closest\napproach but was almost constant during the following night. We performed\ntime-series photometric observations on those two nights to determine the\nrotational properties and phase effect. Methods. The observations were carried\nout using the 0.55-m telescope at Saitama University, Japan. The R-band images\nwere obtained continuously over a 2 hr period at the closest approach and for\nabout 5 hr on the next night. Results. The lightcurve data from the second\nnight indicates a rotational period of 11.0 +1.8/-0.6 hr and a peak-to-peak\namplitude of 1.59 +/- 0.02 mag. The brightness variation before and after the\nclosest approach was separated into two components that are derived from the\nrotation and phase effect. We found that the phase curve slope of this asteroid\nis significantly shallower than those of other L-type asteroids. Conclusions.\nWe suggest that 2012 DA14 is coated with a coarse surface that lacks fine\nregolith particles and/or a high albedo surface.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Oct 2013 06:09:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

At constant tether speed operation, the power is related to the\ntraction force generated by the wing. First, a study of the traction force is\npresented for a general path parametrization. In particular, the sensitivity of\nthe traction force on the path parameters is analyzed. Then, the results of\nthis analysis are exploited to design an algorithm to maximize the force, hence\nthe power, in real-time.

We consider networks with finite number of\noscillators, arbitrary interconnection topology, non-uniform coupling gains and\nnon-identical natural frequencies. We show that such a network synchronizes\nprovided the underlying graph is connected and certain conditions on the\ncoupling gains are satisfied. In the analysis, we consider as states the phase\nand angular frequency differences between the oscillators, and the resulting\ndynamics possesses a continuum of equilibria. The synchronization problem\ninvolves establishing the Lyapunov stability of the fixed points and showing\nconvergence of trajectories to these points.

The basic idea is that the destination,\nsimultaneously with the source, sends a jamming signal to interfere the\neavesdropper near to or co-located with the relay. Similar as physical layer\nnetwork coding, the friendly jamming signal will prevent the eavesdropper from\ndetecting the useful information originated from the source and will not affect\nthe destination on detecting the source information with the presence of the\nknown jamming signal. However, existing investigations are confined to Gaussian\ndistributed signals, which are seldom used in real systems.

In the first system, each\ntransport channel contains a single quantum dot in contact with two electron\nreservoirs. The second system we study is constituted of a double quantum dot\ncoupled to two electrodes and probed by a quantum point contact detector.\nThermodynamic forces are applied to each transport channel that generate\nfluctuating stationary currents. The full counting statistics of the currents\nis obtained starting from a microscopic Hamiltonian describing the electron\ndynamics. We verify that the joined probability distribution of the currents in\neach channel satisfies a fluctuation theorem in the long-time limit. The issue\nof single-current fluctuation theorems for the marginal distribution of the\ncurrents in one of the two channels is also investigated. We show that in the\nlimit of large current ratio between both channels, a single-current\nfluctuation theorem is satisfied individually for the slower circuit in\nagreement with experimental observations. This theorem involves an effective\naffinity which depends on the thermodynamic forces applied to both channels and\nthe specific features of the system considered. A detailed study of the\neffective affinity is made for the two aforementioned systems.

The latter, together with Rowell's\nobservations, constituted the unequivocal demonstration of the Josephson\nsupercurrent-phase relation. Yet, the Josephson effect has further profound\nimplications going beyond electrical transport, as the interplay between the\nCooper condensate and unpaired electrons provides thermal flow through the\njunction with phase coherence as well. Here we report the first demonstration\nof quantum diffraction of a heat flux showing that a temperature-biased single\nJosephson junction is exploited as a diffractor for thermal currents.\nSpecifically, thermal diffraction manifests itself with a peculiar modulation\nof the electron temperature in a small metallic electrode nearby-contacted to\nthe junction when sweeping the magnetic flux $\\Phi$. Remarkably, the observed\ntemperature dependence exhibits $\\Phi$-symmetry and a clear reminiscence with a\nFraunhofer-like modulation pattern, as expected fingerprints for a quantum\ndiffraction phenomenon. Our results confirm a pristine prediction of quantum\nheat transport and, joined with double-junction heat interferometry\ndemonstrated in Nature 492, 401 (2012), exemplify the complementary and\nconclusive proof of the existence of phase-dependent thermal currents in\nJosephson-coupled superconductors. This approach combined with well-known\nmethods for phase-biasing superconducting circuits provides with a novel tool\nfor mastering heat fluxes at the nanoscale.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Oct 2013 09:47:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Nov 2013 15:39:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-04"}

But this argument\ndepends critically on the duration of the Population III era, and because\nPopulation III stars form from pristine gas, in turn depends on the rate of\ngalactic enrichment. We use a semi-analytic model of galaxy formation which\ntracks galactic chemical evolution, to gauge the impact of Population III stars\non reionization. Population III SNe produce distinct metal abundances, and we\nargue that the duration of the Population III era can be constrained by precise\nrelative abundance measurements in high-z damped Ly{\\alpha} absorbers (DLAs),\nwhich provide a chemical record of past star-formation. We find that a single\ngeneration of Population III stars can self-enrich galaxies above the critical\nmetallicity Zcrit=10^-4 Zsun for the Population III-to-II transition, on a very\nshort timescale of ~10^6 yr, owing to the large metal yields and short\nlifetimes of Population III stars. This subsequently terminates the Population\nIII era, hence they contribute >~ 50% of the ionizing photons only for z >~ 30,\nand at z=10 contribute <1%. The Population III contribution can be increased by\ndelaying metal mixing into the ISM. However comparing the resulting metal\nabundance pattern to existing measurements in z <~ 6 DLAs, we show that the\nfractional contribution of high-mass Population III stars to the ionization\nrate must be <~ 10% at z = 10.

A known example is that of\nfractional charges in the fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) regime, which\nis a consequence of strong Coulomb interaction among the electrons whose\nkinetic energy is quenched by the strong magnetic field. Alternatively, the\ninteger QHE (IQHE), with electrons behaving largely as independent particles in\nLandau levels (LLs), lacks such fractionalization. However, for integer LLs\nfilling v=2, 3,... electrons propagate in copropagating adjacent chiral edge\nchannels, and thus interact and modify the non-interacting LLs. For example, at\nv=2, an electron injected selectively into a single non-interacting (bare) edge\nchannel is expected to decompose into a 'fast' mode and a 'slow' mode in the\nregion of interaction; each mode carry fractional charges shared between the\ntwo bare channels. Here, we report our sensitive shot noise measurement that\naffirms the presence of such fractionalization in v=2. Injecting partitioned\ncurrent into a 'hot' edge channel led to low frequency shot noise in the\nadjacent currentless 'cold' edge channel after it had been partitioned.\nControlling the partitioning of the hot and cold channels allowed a\ndetermination of the fractional charges in both channels as well as the\nchannels' velocity difference. This approach can be easily extended to study\ninteraction in two-dimensional systems with a topology dictating edge channels\ntransport.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Oct 2013 13:00:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 30 Oct 2013 19:16:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-31"}

This gives more\ncredence to potential fossil field origin models of the magnetic fields in\nstars, galaxies and compact objects. We analyze a suite of direct numerical\nsimulations (DNS) of decaying large scale helical magnetic fields in the\npresence of non-helical turbulence to further study the physics of helical\nfield decay. We study two separate cases: (1) the initial field is large enough\nto decay resistively, is tracked until it transitions to decay fast, and the\ncritical large scale helical field at that transition is sought; (2) the case\nof Paper I, wherein there is a critical initial helical field strength below\nwhich the field undergoes fast decay right from the beginning. In case (1),\nboth DNS and solutions of the two scale model (from Paper 1), reveal that the\ntransition energy, $E_{c1}$, is independent of the scale of the turbulent\nforcing, within a small range of $\\Rm$. We also find that the kinetic alpha,\n$\\alpha_K$, is subdominant to magnetic alpha, $\\alpha_M$, in the DNS,\njustifying an assumption in the two scale model. For case (2), we show exact\nsolutions of two scale model in the limit of $\\eta \\rightarrow 0$ in fully\nhelical case, leading to the transition energy, $E_{c2} = (k_1/\\kf)^2 M_{eq}$,\nwhere $k_1$ and $\\kf$ are the large scale and small turbulent forcing scale\nrespectively and $M_{eq}$ is the equipartition magnetic energy. The DNS in this\ncase agree qualitatively with the two scale model but the $R_M$ currently\nachievable, is too small to satisfy a condition $3/R_M << (k_1/k_f)^2$,\nnecessary to robustly reveal the transition, $E_{c2}$ (Abridged).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Oct 2013 13:13:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

The research herein explores how the tensile\ndeformation of amorphous polyethylene, modelled with a united atom method\npotential, is influenced by heat and pressure dissipation. The stress-strain\ncurves for the pressure dissipation cases (uniaxial tension) are in qualitative\nagreement with experiments and show that heat dissipation has a large effect on\nthe strain hardening modulus calculated by molecular dynamics simulations. The\nevolution of the energy associated with bonded and non-bonded terms was\nquantified as a function of strain as well as the evolution of stress in both\nthe loading and non-loading directions to give insight into how the stress\nstate is altered within the elastic, yield, strain softening, and strain\nhardening regions. The stress partitioning shows a competition between\n`tensile' Van der Waal's interactions and `compressive' bond stretching forces,\nwith the characteristic yield stress peak clearly associated with the\nnon-bonded stress. The lack of heat dissipation had the largest effect on the\nstrain hardening regime, where an increase in the calculated temperature\ncorrelated with faster chain alignment in the loading direction and more rapid\nconformation changes. In part, these observations demonstrate the role that\nheat and pressure dissipation play on deformation characteristics of amorphous\npolymers, particularly for the strain hardening regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Oct 2013 15:04:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-03"}

More specifically, we consider a class of spherically\nsymmetric manifolds having two asymptotically hyperbolic ends and study the\nscattering properties of massless Dirac waves evolving on such manifolds. Using\nthe spherical symmetry of the model, the stationary scattering is encoded by a\ncountable family of one-dimensional Dirac equations.

The NuSTAR data demonstrate that X-1 has a clear cutoff above 10 keV,\nwhose presence was only marginally detectable with previous X-ray observations.\nThis cutoff rules out the interpretation of X-1 as a black hole in a standard\nlow/hard state, and it is deeper than predicted for the downturn of a broadened\niron line in a reflection-dominated regime. The cutoff differs from the\nprediction of a single-temperature Comptonization model. Further, a cold\ndisk-like black body component at ~0.3 keV is required by the data, confirming\nprevious measurements by XMM-Newton only. We observe a spectral transition in\nX-2, from a state with high luminosity and strong variability to a\nlower-luminosity state with no detectable variability, and we link this\nbehavior to a transition from a super-Eddington to a sub-Eddington regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Oct 2013 15:42:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Oct 2013 08:50:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 22 Nov 2013 18:10:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

On the logarithm scale this ratio\nbecomes one half ((1/2)). It remains an open question, due to lack of complete\ndata for various cases with restricted growth, whether this e^{1/2} ratio can\nbe stated as e^{1/2}-Law. Two established examples already published, one for\nan epidemic spreading and one for droplet production, support however this\nratio. Another example appears to be the height of humain body. For boys the\nmaximum height occurs near 23 years old while the maximum growth rate is at the\nage near 14, and there ratio is close to e^{1/2}. The main theoretical base to\nobtain this conclusion is problem independent, provided the growth process is\nrestricted, such as public intervention to control the spreading of\ncommunicable epidemics, so that an entropy is associated with the process and\nthe role of dissipation, representing the mechanism of intervention, is\nmaximized. Under this formulation the principle of maximum rate of entropy\nproduction is used to make the production process problem independent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Oct 2013 14:52:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-13"}
