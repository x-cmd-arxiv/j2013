We extend the\nexisting literature on agent-based models of political economy in the following\nmanner: (1) by introducing a new class of agents- oligarchs - that represent\nleaders of firms in a common industry who lobby for beneficial subsidies\nthrough campaign donations; and (2) by investigating the effects of ideological\npreferences of the oligarchs on legislative action. We test hypotheses from the\nliterature in political economics on the behavior of oligarchs and political\nparties as they interact, under conditions of imperfect information and bounded\nrationality. Our key results indicate that (1) oligarchs tend to donate less to\npolitical campaigns when the parties are more resistant to changing their\npolicies, or when voters are more informed; and (2) if Oligarchs donate to\nparties based on a combination of ideological and profit motivations, Oligarchs\nwill tend to donate at a lower equilibrium level, due to the influence of lost\nprofits.

The RV variations reported herein range from\nless than 4 m/s to 135 m/s, yet the stars all have amplitudes of photometric\nvariability less than 3 mmag, reflecting the preference of the RV program for\nchromospherically \"quiet\" stars.

We also find that\nspot models of the observed light curves systematically underpredict the\nobserved RV variations by factors of ~2--1000, likely because the low level\nphotometric variations in our sample are driven by processes not included in\nsimple spot models. The stars best fit by these models tend to have simpler\nlight curves, dominated by a single relatively high amplitude component of\nvariability.

An \"off-axis\" GRB burst (i.e. whose relativistic jet points away\nfrom us) is expected to have late-time radio emission even in the absence of\nsignificant prompt gamma-ray emission. From our sample, we detected only SN\n2003gk with an 8.4-GHz flux density of $2260 \\pm 130 \\,\\mu$Jy.

The reason for this are delicate cancellations, which emerge due\nto the graded symmetry in partially quenched QCD with valence, sea and ghost\nquarks. The modified Luescher equation in case of partial twisting is given.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Oct 2013 11:12:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

The\ncontent of the paper is analytical and numerical. Concerning the analytical\ncontribution, we show that an approximate description of the dynamics of the\nheavy particle can be carried out in two steps: first comes the interaction,\nthen the free evolution. In particular, all effects of the interaction can be\nembodied in the action of a collision operator that acts on the initial state\nof the heavy particle.

We further explore the process of high energy\ncollisions with the general geodesics with arbitrary angular momentum on the\nequatorial plane away from the central point. Although in this paper we deal\nwith theMajumdar-Papapetrou spacetime which serves as a toy example\nrepresenting multiple black holes, we speculate on the possibility that the\nultra-high energy collisions would also occur in the more general setting like\ncolliding black holes, when distance between the black holes is extremely\nsmall, which can in principle be verified in the numerical relativity\nsimulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Oct 2013 14:30:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 Sep 2014 09:26:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-06"}

Events with long-range\nmultiparticle correlations (LC), short-range multiparticle correlations (SC)\nand mixed type (MT) in pseudorapidity distribution of secondary particles, are\nselected by Hurst method in accordance of Hurst curve behavior.

These advantage\nratios increase with network size. The key new ingredient is the exact\nequivalence discovered between the problem of maximizing network bisection for\nlarge classes of practically interesting Cayley graphs and the problem of\nmaximizing codeword distance for linear error correcting codes. Resulting\ntranslation recipe converts existent optimal error correcting codes into\noptimal throughput networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Oct 2013 05:02:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-25"}
