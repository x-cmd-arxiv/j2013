A\nbasic challenge in the program to compute the GSF for orbits around a Kerr\nblack hole is that the standard procedure for reconstructing the perturbation\nis formulated in a class of radiation gauges, in which the particle singularity\nis non-isotropic and extends away from the particle's location. Here we present\ntwo practical schemes for calculating the GSF using a radiation-gauge\nreconstructed metric as input. The schemes are based on a detailed analysis of\nthe local structure of the particle singularity in the radiation gauges. We\nidentify 3 types of radiation gauges: two containing a radial string-like\nsingularity emanating from the particle, either in one direction (\"half-string\"\ngauges) or both directions (\"full-string\" gauges); and a third type containing\nno strings but with a jump discontinuity across a surface intersecting the\nparticle. Based on a flat-space example, we argue that the standard\nmode-by-mode reconstruction procedure yields the \"regular half\" of a\nhalf-string solution, or (equivalently) either of the regular halves of a\nno-string solution. For the half-string case, we formulate the GSF in a locally\ndeformed radiation gauge that removes the string singularity near the particle.\nWe derive a mode-sum formula for the GSF in this gauge, analogous to the\nstandard Lorenz-gauge formula but with modified regularization parameters. For\nthe no-string case, we formulate the GSF directly, without a local deformation,\nand we derive a mode-sum formula that requires no correction to the parameters\nbut involves a certain averaging procedure.

Thus, the accuracy of error estimation is\ncritical. Error estimation is problematic in small-sample classifier design\nbecause the error must be estimated using the same data from which the\nclassifier has been designed. Use of prior knowledge, in the form of a prior\ndistribution on an uncertainty class of feature-label distributions to which\nthe true, but unknown, feature-distribution belongs, can facilitate accurate\nerror estimation (in the mean-square sense) in circumstances where accurate\ncompletely model-free error estimation is impossible.

To determine the collision rate, many\nnumerical studies rely on the 'Ghost Collision Approximation' (GCA), which\nsimply records how often pairs of point particles come within a threshold\ndistance. In many applications, the suspended particles stick (or in the case\nof liquid droplets, coalesce) upon collision, and it is the frequency of first\ncontact which is of interest. If a pair of 'ghost' particles undergoes multiple\ncollisions, the GCA may overestimate the true collision rate.

Two opportunities for\nSingle-Instruction Multiple-Data (SIMD) parallelization of MCMC sampling for\nprobabilistic graphical models are presented. In exchangeable models with many\nobservations such as Bayesian Generalized Linear Models, child-node\ncontributions to the conditional posterior of each node can be calculated\nconcurrently. In undirected graphs with discrete nodes, concurrent sampling of\nconditionally-independent nodes can be transformed into a SIMD form.\nHigh-performance libraries with multi-threading and vectorization capabilities\ncan be readily applied to such SIMD opportunities to gain decent speedup, while\na series of high-level source-code and runtime modifications provide further\nperformance boost by reducing parallelization overhead and increasing data\nlocality for NUMA architectures.

Existing relational models only involve very limited\ninformation, namely the binary directional link data, embedded in a network to\nlearn hidden networking structures. There is other rich and meaningful\ninformation (e.g., various attributes of entities and more granular information\nthan binary elements such as \"like\" or \"dislike\") missed, which play a critical\nrole in forming and understanding relations in a network. In this work, we\npropose an informative relational model (InfRM) framework to adequately involve\nrich information and its granularity in a network, including metadata\ninformation about each entity and various forms of link data. Firstly, an\neffective metadata information incorporation method is employed on the prior\ninformation from relational models MMSB and LFRM. This is to encourage the\nentities with similar metadata information to have similar hidden structures.\nSecondly, we propose various solutions to cater for alternative forms of link\ndata. Substantial efforts have been made towards modelling appropriateness and\nefficiency, for example, using conjugate priors. We evaluate our framework and\nits inference algorithms in different datasets, which shows the generality and\neffectiveness of our models in capturing implicit structures in networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Oct 2013 05:47:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-08"}

Although routing strategies is an important topic in\nMANETs, other topics such as data access are also crucial since the final goal\nof using Ad-hoc networks is to provide data access to mobile nodes. One of the\nmost attractive techniques used to improve the data access performance in MANET\nenvironment is cooperative caching; which means multiple caching nodes share\nand cooperatively manage the cached contents. It is lead the research to\nimportant questions, what data should be cached, where, when, and how?

As this mechanism is size-dependent, we expect dust grains\nto be spatially segregated according to their sizes. However, because of the\ncomplex interplay between radiation pressure, collisions and dynamical\nperturbations, this spatial segregation of the particle size distribution (PSD)\nhas proven difficult to investigate with numerical models. We propose to\nexplore this issue using a new-generation code that can handle some of the\ncoupling between dynamical and collisional effects. We investigate how PSDs\nbehave in both unperturbed discs \"at rest\" and in discs pertubed by planetary\nobjects. We use the DyCoSS code of Thebault(2012) to investigate the coupled\neffect of collisions, radiation pressure and dynamical perturbations in systems\nhaving reached a steady state. We consider 2 setups: a narrow ring perturbed by\nan exterior planet, and an extended disc into which a planet is embedded. For\nboth setups we consider an additional unperturbed case with no planet. We also\ninvestigate how possible spatial size segregation affect disc images at\ndifferent wavelengths. We find that PSDs are always strongly spatially\nsegregated. The only case for which they follow a standard dn/dr = C.r**(-3.5)\nlaw is for an unperturbed narrow ring, but only within the parent body ring\nitself. For all other configurations, the PSD can strongly depart from such\npower laws and have strong spatial gradients. As an example, the geometrical\ncross section of the disc is rarely dominated by the smallest grains on bound\norbits, as it is expected to be in standard PSDs in s**q with q<-3. Although\nthe exact profiles and spatial variations of PSDs are a complex function of the\nconsidered set-up, we are however able to derive some robust results that\nshould be useful for image-or-SED-fitting models of observed discs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Oct 2013 13:48:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Oct 2013 07:30:26 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 19 Nov 2013 06:53:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

New and important results are obtained in the particular\ncase of Lie algebroids. The Lagrange mechanical $(\\rho ,\\eta)$% -systems are\nthe spaces necessary to develop a new Lagrangian formalism. We obtain the\n$(\\rho ,\\eta)$-semispray associated to a regular Lagrangian $L$ and external\nforce $F_{e}$ and we derive the equations of Euler-Lagrange type. So, a new\nsolution for the Weinstein's Problem in the general framework of generalized\nLie algebroids is presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Oct 2013 05:53:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-09"}

From observed Hubble data (OHD) set (12\npoints), we have obtained the bounds of the arbitrary parameters (A,B) of MCG\nby minimizing the \\chi^{2} test. Next due to joint analysis of BAO and CMB\nobservations, we have also obtained the best fit values and the bounds of the\nparameters (A,B) by fixing some other parameters. We have also taken type Ia\nsupernovae data set (union 2 data set with 557 data points). Next due to joint\nanalysis with SNe, we have obtained the best fit values of parameters. The\nbest-fit values and bounds of the parameters are obtained by 66%, 90% and 99%\nconfidence levels for OHD, OHD+BAO, OHD+BAO+CMB and OHD+BAO+CMB+SNe joint\nanalysis.
