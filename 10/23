Furthermore, it\nanalytically predicts the frequencies of peaks in enhanced transmission, the\nquality factor of the peaks, and explains their dependence on variation in the\nhole radius, periodicity, and the film thickness over a wide range of\ngeometries.

When both bases are orthogonal, it is known that the\nsparse representation is unique when the sparsity $K$ of the signal satisfies\n$K<1/\\mu(D)$, where $\\mu(D)$ is the mutual coherence of the dictionary.\nFurthermore, the sparse representation can be obtained in polynomial time by\nBasis Pursuit (BP), when $K<0.91/\\mu(D)$. Therefore, there is a gap between the\nunicity condition and the one required to use the polynomial-complexity BP\nformulation. For the case of general dictionaries, it is also well known that\nfinding the sparse representation under the only constraint of unicity is\nNP-hard.\n  In this paper, we introduce, for the case of Fourier and canonical bases, a\npolynomial complexity algorithm that finds all the possible $K$-sparse\nrepresentations of a signal under the weaker condition that $K<\\sqrt{2}\n/\\mu(D)$. Consequently, when $K<1/\\mu(D)$, the proposed algorithm solves the\nunique sparse representation problem for this structured dictionary in\npolynomial time. We further show that the same method can be extended to many\nother pairs of bases, one of which must have local atoms.

The uncertainty in the best-fit flux rises\nsharply as a function of nearest-neighbor distance for objects with a neighbor\nwithin 60% of the PSF size. Similarly, the uncertainty increases quickly for\nobjects blended with a neighbor more than four times brighter. For all other\nobjects the fidelity of PyGFit's results depends only on flux, and the\nuncertainty is primarily limited by sky noise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Oct 2013 20:00:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

In recent\nyears, the emergence of reduced dimensionality materials has suggested that\nthese components can be scaled down to atomic thicknesses. Although high\nperformance field-effect devices have been achieved from monolayered materials\nand their heterostructures, a p-n heterojunction diode derived from ultrathin\nmaterials is notably absent and constrains the fabrication of complex\nelectronic and optoelectronic circuits. Here, we demonstrate a gate-tunable p-n\nheterojunction diode using semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes\n(s-SWCNTs) and single-layer molybdenum disulfide (SL-MoS2) as p-type and n-type\nsemiconductors, respectively. The vertical stacking of these two direct band\ngap semiconductors forms a heterojunction with electrical characteristics that\ncan be tuned with an applied gate bias to achieve a wide range of charge\ntransport behavior ranging from insulating to rectifying with\nforward-to-reverse bias current ratios exceeding 10^4. This heterojunction\ndiode also responds strongly to optical irradiation with an external quantum\nefficiency (EQE) of 25% and fast photoresponse < 15 {\\mu}s. Since SWCNTs have a\ndiverse range of electrical properties as a function of chirality, and since an\nincreasing number of atomically thin 2D nanomaterials are being isolated, the\ngate-tunable p-n heterojunction concept presented here should be widely\ngeneralizable to realize diverse ultrathin, high-performance electronics and\noptoelectronics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Oct 2013 22:36:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-24"}

Here we demonstrate, using\na simple model, that evolution can cross wide valleys to produce \"irreducibly\ncomplex\" adaptations by making use of previously cryptic mutations. When\nrevealed by an evolutionary capacitor, previously cryptic mutants have higher\ninitial frequencies than do new mutations, bringing them closer to a\nvalley-crossing saddle in allele frequency space. Moreover, simple\ncombinatorics imply an enormous number of candidate combinations exist within\navailable cryptic genetic variation. We model the dynamics of crossing of a\nwide adaptive valley after a capacitance event using both numerical simulations\nand analytical approximations. Although individual valley crossing events\nbecome less likely as valleys widen, by taking the combinatorics of genotype\nspace into account, we see that revealing cryptic variation can cause the\nfrequent evolution of complex adaptations.

This scattering process in the superradiant regime\nw<qQ/r_+ (here w, q, Q, and r_{+-} are the conserved frequency of the wave, the\ncharge coupling constant of the field, the electric charge of the black hole,\nand the horizon radii of the black hole, respectively) results in the\nextraction of Coulomb energy and electric charge from the charged black hole.\nThe black-hole-field system can be made unstable by placing a reflecting mirror\naround the black hole which prevents the amplified field from escaping to\ninfinity. This charged black-hole-mirror system is the spherically symmetric\nanalogue of the rotating black-hole-mirror bomb of Press and Teukolsky. In the\npresent paper we study analytically the charged black-hole-mirror bomb in the\nasymptotic regime qQ>>1 and for mirror radii r_m in the near-horizon region\nx_m=(r_m-r_+)/r_+<<tau, where tau=(r_+-r_-)/r_+ is the dimensionless\ntemperature of the black hole. In particular, we derive analytic expressions\nfor the oscillation frequencies w_R and the instability growth timescales 1/w_I\nof the superradiant confined fields. Remarkably, we find a simple linear\nscaling w_I \\propto qQ/r_+ for the imaginary part of the resonances in the\nasymptotic qQ>>(tau/x_m)^2>>1 regime, which implies that the instability\ntimescale 1/w_I of the system can be made arbitrarily short in the\nqQ-->infinity limit. The short instability timescale found in the linear regime\nalong with the spherical symmetry of the system, make the charged bomb a\nconvenient toy model for future numerical studies aimed to investigate the\nnon-linear end-state of superradiant instabilities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Oct 2013 03:22:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

In this paper, using three simplest dark\nenergy models ($\\Lambda$CDM, $w$CDM, and CPL), we further explore the evolution\nof $\\beta$ and its effects on parameter estimation. In addition to the SNLS3\ndata, we also take into account the Planck distance priors data, as well as the\nlatest galaxy clustering (GC) data extracted from SDSS DR7 and BOSS.

In other words, $\\beta$ deviates from a constant\nat 6$\\sigma$ confidence levels. This conclusion is insensitive to the dark\nenergy models considered, showing the importance of considering the evolution\nof $\\beta$ in the cosmology-fits. Furthermore, it is found that varying $\\beta$\ncan significantly change the fitting results of various cosmological\nparameters: using the SNLS3 data alone, varying $\\beta$ yields a larger\n$\\Omega_m$ for the $\\Lambda$CDM model; using the SNLS3+CMB+GC data, varying\n$\\beta$ yields a larger $\\Omega_m$ and a smaller $h$ for all the models.\nMoreover, we find that these results are much closer to those given by the\nCMB+GC data, compared to the cases of treating $\\beta$ as a constant.

We also estimate the gas\nmass in the embedded clusters and its ratio to the stellar mass. S235 East1\nappears to be less evolved than S235 East2 and S235 Central. In S235 East1 the\nmolecular gas mass exceeds that in the other clusters. Also, this cluster is\nmore embedded in the parent gas cloud than the other two. Comparison with a\ntheoretical model shows that the formation of these three clusters could have\nbeen stimulated by the expansion of the Sh2-235 HII region (hereafter S235) via\na collect-and-collapse process, provided the density in the surrounding gas\nexceeds $3\\cdot10^3$ cm$^{-3}$, or via collapse of pre-existing clumps. The\nexpansion of S235 cannot be responsible for star formation in the southern S235\nA-B region. However, formation of the massive stars in this region might have\nbeen triggered by a large-scale supernova shock. Thus, triggered star formation\nin the studied region may come in three varieties, namely collect-and-collapse\nand collapse of pre-existing clumps, both initiated by expansion of the local\nHII regions, and triggering by an external large-scale shock. We argue that the\nC235 A HII region expands into a highly non-uniform medium with increasing\ndensity. It is too young to trigger star formation in its vicinity by a\ncollect-and-collapse process. There is an age spread inside the S235 A-B\nregion. Massive stars in the S235 A-B region are considerably younger than\nlower mass stars in the same area.

Particle drifts cause chargesign dependent modulation and\na 22-year cycle, adding complexity to determining the respective very LIS from\nobservations only at Earth. However, with measurements now made by the Voyager\n1 spacecraft in the vicinity of the heliopause, it is possible to determine a\nvery LIS for galactic electrons between about 5 MeV and about 120 MeV. At these\nlow energies also galactic protons observed in the outer heliosphere had been\ncompletely obscured by the so-call anomalous component which is accelerated\ninside the heliosheath. Since August 2012, these anomalous cosmic rays are\nsubstantially depleted at Voyager 1 so that also for cosmic ray ions it is now\npossible to obtain a lower limit to their very LIS. Combining numerical\nmodelling of solar modulation with the accurate measurements by the PAMELA\nmission and with Voyager observations, the lower limit of the very LIS for\nelectrons, protons and helium, and other ions, can be determined from about 5\nMeV and above. These spectra are called heliopause spectra, considered to be\nthe lowest possible very LIS. Also from an astrophysics point of view, the\ndetermination of what can be called a very LIS, not just an averaged galactic\nspectrum, is encouraging. The mentioned aspects are discussed, focussing on a\ncomparison of recent heliospheric observations and corresponding solar\nmodulation modelling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Oct 2013 07:26:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-25"}

In this article we\ncalculate the complex dynamic dipole polarizability of ground-state erbium, a\nrare-earth atom that was recently Bose-condensed. The polarizability is\ncalculated with the sum-over-state formula inherent to second-order\nperturbation theory. The summation is performed on transition energies and\ntransition dipole moments from ground-state erbium, which are computed using\nthe Racah-Slater least-square fitting procedure provided by the Cowan codes.\nThis allows us to predict 9 unobserved odd-parity energy levels of total\nangular momentum J=5, 6 and 7, in the range 25000-31000 cm-1 above the ground\nstate. Regarding the trapping potential, we find that ground-state erbium\nessentially behaves like a spherically-symmetric atom, in spite of its large\nelectronic angular momentum. We also find a mostly isotropic van der Waals\ninteraction between two ground-state erbium atoms, characterized by a\ncoefficient C_6^{iso}=1760 a.u.. On the contrary, the photon-scattering rate\nshows a pronounced anisotropy, since it strongly depends on the polarization of\nthe trapping light.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Oct 2013 08:20:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-11"}

The damping of fluctuations on scales smaller than the\nDM particle free streaming scale corresponds to a suppression of the total\nmatter power spectrum on large wave numbers k. We derive the time evolution of\nthe variance of the matter power spectrum for various cosmological models and\nparameters by numerically computing the power spectrum with a modified version\nof the Boltzmann code CAMB, for different values of the cut-off parameter kmax.\nSuitable analytical approximations of the numerical results are presented. We\nthen characterize the CMB free-free spectral distortion accounting for the\namplification effect coming from clumping factor. Indeed, the clumpiness,\nassociated to the density contrast of the intergalactic medium, increases at\ndecreasing redshift. The analysis is carried out for selected astrophysical and\nphenomenological cosmological reionization histories, for which we evaluate the\nimpact of the clumping factor on the free-free distortion and discuss the\nwavelength dependence of the predicted signal. Finally, we address a comparison\nwith other classes of unavoidable CMB spectral distortions and future\nobservational perspectives. While Comptonization from reionization is dominant\nat high frequencies, the free-free signal predicted in the considered models\ncontributes to the distortion at a level of few (few tens) per cent at\nfrequencies below about 25 GHz (10 GHz) and represents the main signature below\nabout 4 GHz.

While this type of phenomena has been a\nwell-established direction of research in condensed matter for decades, the\nvariety of today's accessible scenarios pose fundamental new challenges to\ndescribe them. A core complication is the multi-orbital nature of the\nlow-energy electronic structure of these systems, such as the multi-d orbital\nnature of electrons in iron pnictides and transition-metal oxides in general,\nbut also electronic states of matter on lattices with multiple sites per unit\ncell such as the honeycomb or kagome lattice. In this review, we propagate the\nfunctional renormalization group (FRG) as a suited approach to investigate\nmulti-orbital Fermi surface instabilities. The primary goal of the review is to\ndescribe the FRG in explicit detail and render it accessible to everyone both\nat a technical and intuitive level. Summarizing recent progress in the field of\nmulti-orbital Fermi surface instabilities, we illustrate how the unbiased\nfashion by which the FRG treats all kinds of ordering tendencies guarantees an\nadequate description of electronic phase diagrams and often allows to obtain\nparameter trends of sufficient accuracy to make qualitative predictions for\nexperiments. This review includes detailed and illustrative illustrations of\nmagnetism and, in particular, superconductivity for the iron pnictides from the\nviewpoint of FRG. Furthermore, it discusses candidate scenarios for topological\nbulk singlet superconductivity and exotic particle-hole condensates on\nhexagonal lattices such as sodium-doped cobaltates, graphene doped to van Hove\nFilling, and the kagome Hubbard model. In total, the FRG promises to be one of\nthe most versatile and revealing numerical approaches to address unconventional\nFermi surface instabilities in future fields of condensed matter research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Oct 2013 11:45:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

We aim to\ncomplement this heuristic approach with a physically motivated, quantitative\nGalactic dynamo model -- a model that moreover allows for the evolution of the\nsystem as a whole, instead of just solving the induction equation for a fixed\nstatic disc. Building on the framework of mean-field magnetohydrodynamics and\nextending it to the realm of a hybrid evolution, we perform three-dimensional\nglobal simulations of the Galactic disc. Closure coefficients embodying the\nmean-field dynamo are calibrated against resolved box simulations of\nsupernova-driven interstellar turbulence. The emerging dynamo solutions\ncomprise a mixture of the dominant axisymmetric S0 mode, with even parity, and\na subdominant A0 mode, with odd parity. Notably, such a superposition of modes\ncreates a strong localised vertical field on one side of the Galactic disc. We\nmoreover find significant radial pitch angles, which decay with radius --\nexplained by flaring of the disc. In accordance with previous work, magnetic\ninstabilities appear to be restricted to the less-stirred outer Galactic disc.\nTheir main effect is to create strong fields at large radii such that the\nradial scale length of the magnetic field increases from 4 kpc (for the case of\na mean-field dynamo alone) to about 10 kpc in the hybrid models. There remain\naspects (e.g., spiral arms, X-shaped halo fields, fluctuating fields) that are\nnot captured by the current model and that will require further development\ntowards a fully dynamical evolution. Nevertheless, the work presented\ndemonstrates that a hybrid modelling of the Galactic dynamo is feasible and can\nserve as a foundation for future efforts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Oct 2013 12:55:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

So far, there exists no bottom-up\nunderstanding of how the microscopic dynamics and interactions between the\nconstituents are related to the system's ordering instability. In this paper,\nwe study a class of models for propelled colloids allowing an explicit\ntreatment of the microscopic details of the collision process. Specifically,\nthe model equations are Newtonian equations of motion with separate force terms\nfor particles' driving, dissipation and interaction forces. Focusing on dilute\nparticle systems, we analyze the binary scattering behavior for these models,\nand determine-based on the microscopic dynamics-the corresponding\ncollision-rule, i.e., the mapping of pre-collisional velocities and impact\nparameter on post-collisional velocities.

We investigate the dominant formation mechanism of H2CO and CH3OH in\nthe Horsehead PDR and its associated dense core. Methods. We performed deep\nintegrations of several H2CO and CH3OH lines at two positions in the Horsehead,\nnamely the PDR and dense core, with the IRAM-30m telescope. In addition, we\nobserved one H2CO higher frequency line with the CSO telescope at both\npositions. We determine the H2CO and CH3OH column densities and abundances from\nthe single-dish observations complemented with IRAM-PdBI high-angular\nresolution maps (6\") of both species. We compare the observed abundances with\nPDR models including either pure gas-phase chemistry or both gas-phase and\ngrain surface chemistry. Results. We derive CH3OH abundances relative to total\nnumber of hydrogen atoms of ~1.2e-10 and ~2.3e-10 in the PDR and dense core\npositions, respectively. These abundances are similar to the inferred H2CO\nabundance in both positions (~2e-10). We find an abundance ratio H2CO/CH3OH of\n~2 in the PDR and ~1 in the dense core. Pure gas-phase models cannot reproduce\nthe observed abundances of either H2CO or CH3OH at the PDR position. Both\nspecies are therefore formed on the surface of dust grains and are subsequently\nphotodesorbed into the gas-phase at this position. At the dense core, on the\nother hand, photodesorption of ices is needed to explain the observed abundance\nof CH3OH, while a pure gas-phase model can reproduce the observed H2CO\nabundance. The high-resolution observations show that CH3OH is depleted onto\ngrains at the dense core. CH3OH is thus present in an envelope around this\nposition, while H2CO is present in both the envelope and the dense core itself.\nConclusions. Photodesorption is an efficient mechanism to release complex\nmolecules in low FUV-illuminated PDRs, where thermal desorption of ice mantles\nis ineffective.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Oct 2013 14:08:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

We provide an algorithm that takes into account important schema\ninformation to enumerate only the minimal necessary plans among all possible\nplans. Importantly, this algorithm is a strict generalization of all known\nPTIME self-join-free conjunctive queries: A query is in PTIME if and only if\nour algorithm returns one single plan. Furthermore, our approach is a\ngeneralization of a family of efficient ranking methods from graphs to\nhypergraphs.
