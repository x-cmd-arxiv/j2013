The importance of electronic correlations even in A3C60 has been\nhighlighted by the recent discovery of two expanded fulleride Cs3C60 isomeric\nphases that are Mott insulators at ambient pressure. Both phases undergo a\npressure induced first order Mott transition to SC with a (p, T) phase diagram\ndisplaying a dome shaped SC, a common situation encountered nowadays in\ncorrelated electron systems.

We focus on the downlink, which is both more demanding in terms of\ntraffic and more challenging in terms of implementation than the uplink. In\norder to enable multiuser joint precoding of the downlink signals, channel\nstate information at the transmitter side is required. We consider Time\nDivision Duplex (TDD), where the {\\em downlink} channels can be learned from\nthe user uplink pilot signals, thanks to channel reciprocity. Furthermore,\ncoherent multiuser joint precoding is possible only if the APs maintain a\nsufficiently accurate relative timing and phase synchronization. AP\nsynchronization and TDD reciprocity calibration are two key problems to be\nsolved in order to enable distributed MU-MIMO downlink.

SPH simulations of disks inside triaxial dark halos suggest that the two\nsymmetric spots at 130 arcsecs and the narrow arms may be produced by gas at\nturning points in an elliptical disk, alternatively the potential ellipticity\ncan be originated by tidally induced strong stellar bar/arms.

High-contrast direct imaging of circumstellar disks is\nlimited by quasi-static speckle noise and ADI is commonly used to suppress\nthose speckles. However, the application of ADI can result in self-subtraction\nof the disk signal due to the disk's finite spatial extent. This signal\nattenuation varies with radial separation and biases measurements of the disk's\nsurface brightness, thereby compromising inferences regarding the physical\nprocesses responsible for the dust distribution. To compensate for this\nattenuation, we forward-model the disk structure and compute the form of the\nself-subtraction function at each separation.

Whether or not these experiments\ndeliver a detection of cosmological emission, their limited sensitivity will\nprevent them from providing detailed information about the astrophysics of\nreionization. In this work, we consider what types of measurements will be\nenabled by a next-generation of larger 21 cm EoR telescopes. To calculate the\ntype of constraints that will be possible with such arrays, we use simple\nmodels for the instrument, foreground emission, and the reionization history.\nWe focus primarily on an instrument modeled after the $\\sim 0.1~\\rm{km}^2$\ncollecting area Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA) concept design, and\nparameterize the uncertainties with regard to foreground emission by\nconsidering different limits to the recently described \"wedge\" footprint in\nk-space. Uncertainties in the reionization history are accounted for using a\nseries of simulations which vary the ionizing efficiency and minimum virial\ntemperature of the galaxies responsible for reionization, as well as the mean\nfree path of ionizing photons through the IGM.

Such a feature was first detected\nduring the X-ray flaring activity associated with the giant outburst that the\nsource experienced in 1999 September. The extraordinarily large equivalent\nwidth line was then ascribed to reflection/reprocessing of fluorescent Fe\nemission within an extended optically thick outflow enshrouding the binary\nsystem as a result of a short-lived, super-Eddington accretion episode. Making\nuse of new and archival X-ray observations, we show here that a similar feature\npersists over four orders of magnitude in luminosity, down to Eddington ratios\nas low as log(L_Edd) = -4.5, where the existence of an optically thick envelope\nappears at odds with any viable accretion flow model. Possible interpretations\nfor this highly unusual X-ray spectrum include a blend of Doppler\nshifted/boosted Fe lines from unresolved X-ray jets (a la SS433), or, the first\nGalactic analog of a blazar spectrum, where the >4 keV emission would\ncorrespond to the onset of the Inverse Compton hump. Either requires a low\ninclination angle of the jet with respect to the line of sight, in agreement\nwith the estimates for the 1999 superluminal jet (i_jet<10 deg). The fast\nvariability of the feature, combined with the high orbital axis inclination (60\ndeg< i_orb<71 deg), argue for a rapidly precessing accretion flow around V4641\nSgr, possibly leading to a transient microblazar behavior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Oct 2013 20:09:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

In the latter, strong radiative cooling reduces\nconsiderably the cluster wind mechanical energy output and affects particularly\nthe cluster central regions, leading to frequent thermal instabilities that\ndiminish the pressure and inhibit the exit of the reinserted matter. Instead\nmatter accumulates there and is expected to eventually lead to gravitational\ninstabilities and to further stellar formation with the matter reinserted by\nformer massive stars. The main outcome of the calculations is that the critical\nline is almost two orders of magnitude or more, depending on the assumed value\nof the adiabatic wind terminal speed, lower than when only gas radiative\ncooling is applied.

A nice property of\nSVM is that the non-support vectors have no effect on the resulting classifier.\nMotivated by this observation, we present fast and efficient screening rules to\ndiscard non-support vectors by analyzing the dual problem of SVM via\nvariational inequalities (DVI). As a result, the number of data instances to be\nentered into the optimization can be substantially reduced. Some appealing\nfeatures of our screening method are: (1) DVI is safe in the sense that the\nvectors discarded by DVI are guaranteed to be non-support vectors; (2) the data\nset needs to be scanned only once to run the screening, whose computational\ncost is negligible compared to that of solving the SVM problem; (3) DVI is\nindependent of the solvers and can be integrated with any existing efficient\nsolvers. We also show that the DVI technique can be extended to detect\nnon-support vectors in the least absolute deviations regression (LAD). To the\nbest of our knowledge, there are currently no screening methods for LAD. We\nhave evaluated DVI on both synthetic and real data sets. Experiments indicate\nthat DVI significantly outperforms the existing state-of-the-art screening\nrules for SVM, and is very effective in discarding non-support vectors for LAD.\nThe speedup gained by DVI rules can be up to two orders of magnitude.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Oct 2013 23:01:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-29"}

(2009a, arXiv:0905.1757), we\ncollected times of superhump maxima for SU UMa-type dwarf novae mainly observed\nduring the 2012-2013 season. We found three objects (V444 Peg, CSS J203937 and\nMASTER J212624) having strongly positive period derivatives despite the long\norbital period (Porb). By using the period of growing stage (stage A)\nsuperhumps, we obtained mass ratios for six objects. We characterized nine new\nWZ Sge-type dwarf novae. We made a pilot survey of the decline rate of slowly\nfading part of SU UMa-type and WZ Sge-type outbursts. The decline time scale\nwas found to generally follow the expected Porb^(1/4) dependence and WZ\nSge-type outbursts also generally follow this trend. There are some objects\nwhich show slower decline rates, and we consider these objects good candidates\nfor period bouncers. We also studied unusual behavior in some objects,\nincluding BK Lyn which made a transition from an ER UMa-type state to the\nnovalike (standstill) state in 2013 and unusually frequent occurrence of\nsuperoutbursts in NY Ser and CR Boo. We applied least absolute shrinkage and\nselection operator (Lasso) power spectral analysis, which has been proven to be\nvery effective in analyzing the Kepler data, to ground-based photometry of BK\nLyn and detected the dramatic disappearance of the signal of negative\nsuperhumps in 2013. We suggested that the mass-transfer rates did not vary\nstrongly between the ER UMa-type state and novalike state in BK Lyn, and this\ntransition was less likely caused by a systematic variation of the\nmass-transfer rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Oct 2013 04:21:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-20"}

An economical way to address these issues is to invoke the existence of\nsterile neutrinos. We present simple extensions of the standard model with\nadditional three sterile neutrinos and discuss the corresponding PMNS like\nneutrino flavor mixing matrix. The noteworthy features of the sterile neutrino\nscenario advocated here is that the lightest one is almost degenerate with one\nof the active neutrinos, the second sterile has mass of order eV and the\nheaviest one is in the keV range.

We show that the high energy muon and\nthe tau neutrino fluxes from Gamma Ray Bursts can be depleted in IceCube by as\nmuch as 38% and 43% respectively. These substantial depletion in both muon and\ntau neutrino fluxes is due to their small but sizable mixing with the sterile\nneutrinos.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Oct 2013 06:02:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Nov 2013 22:33:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

The coupled mode\ntheory model addresses the effect of two-photon absorption and free-carrier\nabsorption on parametric gain and oscillation thresholds, and ultimately on the\noptimum design for an OPO. The model goes beyond a typical free-space cavity\nconfiguration by incorporating a full modal analysis that admits distributed\nmodes with non-uniform field distribution, relevant to photonic microcavity\nsystems on chip. This leads to a generalization of the concept of nonlinear\nfigure of merit (NFOM) to a vector of coefficients.

In particular we consider the reduction of\nLaplace equation (i.e. the wave equation) in Minkowski space and obtain the\nresults of all previous studies in a straightforward manner. We consider the\nreduction of Laplace equation in spaces which admit Lie point symmetries\ngenerated from a non gradient HV and a proper CKV and we show that the\nreduction with these vectors does not produce Type II hidden symmetries. We\napply the results to General Relativity and consider the reduction of Laplace\nequation in locally rotational symmetric space times (LRS) and in algebraically\nspecial vacuum solutions of Einstein's equations which admit a homothetic\nalgebra acting simply transitively. In each case we determine the Type II\nhidden symmetries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Oct 2013 08:51:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-09"}

The largest grains (0.5-1 micron) in the interstellar size\ndistribution are efficient in scattering near- and mid-infrared radiation.\nThese wavelengths are therefore particularly well suited to probe the still\nuncertain high-end of the size distribution. Aims. We investigate the change in\nappearance of a typical low-mass molecular core from the Ks (2.2 micron) band\nto the Spitzer IRAC 3.6 and 8 micron bands, and compare with model\ncalculations, which include variations of the grain size distribution. Methods.\nWe combine Spitzer IRAC and ground-based near-infrared observations to\ncharacterize the scattered light observed at the near- and mid-infrared\nwavelengths from the core L260. Using a spherical symmetric model core, we\nperform radiative transfer calculations to study the impact of various dust\nsize distributions on the intensity profiles across the core. Results. The\nobserved scattered light patterns in the Ks and 3.6 micron bands are found to\nbe similar. By comparison with radiative transfer models the two profiles place\nconstraints on the relative abundance of small and large (more than 0.25\nmicron) dust grains. The scattered light profiles are found to be inconsistent\nwith an interstellar silicate grain distribution extending only to 0.25 micron\nand large grains are needed to reach the observed fluxes and the flux ratios.\nThe shape of the Ks band surface brightness profile limits the largest grains\nto 1-1.5 micron.

Until recently, most\nshell-model calculations have been confined to a single oscillator shell.\nRecent interest in nuclei away from the stability line, requires however larger\nshell-model spaces. Since the derivation of microscopic effective interactions\nhas been limited to degenerate model spaces, there are both conceptual and\npractical limits to present shell-model calculations that utilize such\ninteractions. Purpose: The aim of this work is to present a novel microscopic\nmethod to calculate effective interactions for the nuclear shell model. Its\nmain difference from existing theories is that it can be applied not only to\ndegenerate model spaces but also to non-degenerate model spaces. Methods: The\nformalism is presented in the form of many-body perturbation theory based on\nthe recently developed Extended Kuo-Krenciglowa method. Our method enables us\nto microscopically construct effective interactions not only in one oscillator\nshell but also for several oscillator shells. Results: We present numerical\nresults using effective interactions within (i) a single oscillator shell like\nthe sd-shell and the pf-shell, and (ii) two major shells like the sdf7p3-shell\nand the pfg9-shell. We also present energy levels of several nuclei which have\ntwo valence nucleons on top of a given closed-shell core. Conclusions: Our\nresults show that the present method works excellently in shell-model spaces\nthat comprise several oscillator shells, as well as in a single oscillator\nshell. We show in particular that the microscopic inter-shell interactions are\nmuch more attractive than has been expected by degenerate perturbation theory.\nThe consequences for shell-model studies are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Oct 2013 12:58:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

We\nalso include a new proof of a theorem of B\\^{o}cher (which is an extension of\nthe Gauss--Lucas theorem to rational functions) using level curves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Oct 2013 15:25:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 20 Nov 2014 02:28:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 11 May 2015 17:32:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-19"}

The objective of\nthe network is not to reconstruct individual sensor readings at designated\nfusion centers but rather to reliably compute some functions thereof. Our\nparticular attention is on real-valued functions that can be represented as a\npost-processed sum of pre-processed sensor readings. Such functions are called\nnomographic functions and their special structure permits the utilization of\nthe interference property of the Gaussian multiple-access channel to reliably\ncompute many linear and nonlinear functions at significantly higher rates than\nthose achievable with standard schemes that combat interference. Motivated by\nthis observation, a computation scheme is proposed that combines a suitable\ndata pre- and post-processing strategy with a nested lattice code designed to\nprotect the sum of pre-processed sensor readings against the channel noise.\nAfter analyzing its computation rate performance, it is shown that at the cost\nof a reduced rate, the scheme can be extended to compute every continuous\nfunction of the sensor readings in a finite succession of steps, where in each\nstep a different nomographic function is computed. This demonstrates the\nfundamental role of nomographic representations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Oct 2013 15:57:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Dec 2014 13:54:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-11"}
