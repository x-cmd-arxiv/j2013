Although\nthere are plenty of methods available in the literature, we concentrate mainly\non approximating the fractional problem either by discretizing the fractional\nterm or expanding the fractional derivatives as a series involving integer\norder derivatives. The former method, as a subclass of direct methods in the\ntheory of calculus of variations, uses finite differences, Grunwald-Letnikov\ndefinition in this case, to discretize the fractional term. Any quadrature rule\nfor integration, regarding the desired accuracy, is then used to discretize the\nwhole problem including constraints. The final task in this method is to solve\na static optimization problem to reach approximated values of the unknown\nfunctions on some mesh points.\n  The latter method, however, approximates fractional problems by classical\nones in which only derivatives of integer order are present. Precisely, two\ncontinuous approximations for fractional derivatives by series involving\nordinary derivatives are introduced. Local upper bounds for truncation errors\nare provided and, through some test functions, the accuracy of the\napproximations are justified. Then we substitute the fractional term in the\noriginal problem with these series and transform the fractional problem to an\nordinary one. Hereafter, we use indirect methods of classical theory, e.g.\nEuler-Lagrange equations, to solve the approximated problem. The methods are\nmainly developed through some concrete examples which either have obvious\nsolutions or the solution is computed using the fractional Euler-Lagrange\nequation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Oct 2013 21:55:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 1 Nov 2013 01:26:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-19"}

In this paper,\nwe survey this problem introduced in previous papers by the authors, we detail\nits close relation with rearrangeable multicast networks, and we provide new\nresults for both viewpoints.\n  A bijective mapping can be computed by 2n - 1 component modifications, that\nis by a program of length 2n - 1, a result equivalent to the rearrangeability\nof the concatenation of two reversed butterfly networks. For a general\narbitrary mapping, we give two methods to build a program with maximal length\n4n-3. Equivalently, this yields rearrangeable multicast routing methods for the\nnetwork formed by four successive butterflies with alternating reversions. The\nfirst method is available for any set S and practically equivalent to a known\nmethod in network theory. The second method, a refinement of the first,\ndescribed when |S| is a power of 2, is new and allows more flexibility than the\nknown method.\n  For a linear mapping, when S is any field, or a quotient of an Euclidean\ndomain (e.g. Z/sZ for any integer s), we build a program with maximal length 2n\n- 1. In this case the assignments are also linear, thereby particularly\nefficient from the algorithmic viewpoint, and giving moreover directly a\nprogram for the inverse when it exists. This yields also a new result on matrix\ndecompositions, and a new result on the multicast properties of two successive\nreversed butterflies.

We show that this\ncoupling controls the dominant dynamics in the rattling of these atoms. We\nprovide preliminary evidence that the rattlers couple to each other primarily\nthrough the T2g mode whereas their coupling to the cage modes occurs through\nthe T1u mode. Rattler coupling through the T2g mode provides insight into the\ntrend in spectral broadening from Cs to K.

The client of such an application is a marketer who would\ntarget these influencers for marketing a given new product, say by providing\nfree samples or discounts. It is natural that before committing resources for\ntargeting an influencer the marketer would be interested in validating the\ninfluence (or network value) of influencers returned. This requires digging\ndeeper into such analytical questions as: who are their followers, on what\nactions (or products) they are influential, etc. However, the current\napproaches to identifying influencers largely work as a black box in this\nrespect. The goal of this paper is to open up the black box, address these\nquestions and provide informative and crisp explanations for validating the\nnetwork value of influencers.\n  We formulate the problem of providing explanations (called PROXI) as a\ndiscrete optimization problem of feature selection.

Recently, we have demonstrated that the quantum\ncollapse is suppressed, and the GS is restored, if repulsive interactions\nbetween particles in the quantum gas are taken into account, in the mean-field\napproximation. This setting can be realized in a gas of dipolar molecules\nattracted to the central charge, with dipole-dipole interactions taken into\nregard too. Here we analyze this problem for a binary gas. GSs supported by the\nrepulsive interactions are constructed in a numerical form, as well as by means\nof analytical approximations for both miscible and immiscible binary systems.\nIn particular, the Thomas-Fermi (TF) approximation is relevant if V is large\nenough. It is found that the GS of the miscible binary gas, both balanced and\nimbalanced, features a weak phase transition at another critical value, V =\n1/2. The transition is characterized by an analyticity-breaking change in the\nstructure of the wave functions at small r. To illustrate the generic character\nof the present phenomenology, we also consider the binary system with the\nattraction between the species (rather than repulsion), in the case when the\ncentral potential pulls a single component only.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Oct 2013 07:25:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

The apparent distribution of the longitude of\nascending node, $\\Omega$, is strongly affected by well-known seasonal effects\nin the discovery rate of NEOs. The deviation from the expected\n$\\pi$-periodicity in the apparent distribution of $\\Omega$ indicates that its\nintrinsic distribution is slightly enhanced along a mean direction,\n$\\bar\\Omega=111^\\circ$; approximately 53% of NEOs have $\\Omega$ values within\n$\\pm90^\\circ$ of $\\bar\\Omega$.

For their intrinsic\ndistributions, our analysis reveals that the Apollo asteroids have non-uniform\n$\\omega$ due to secular dynamics associated with\ninclination-eccentricity-$\\omega$ coupling, and the Amors' $\\varpi$\ndistribution is peaked towards the secularly forced eccentricity vector.

If there is\nmore students with learning disability so it is necessary that first all\nidentify the type of learning disability in group of students. Some students\nhave learning disability of mathematics; some have learning disability of other\nsubjects. By using theory of Automata it easy to analysis the level of\ndisability among all students then deal with them accordingly. For these\npurpose deterministic automata is the best practice. Teacher deals with\ndeterministic students in class and check there response. In this research\ndeterministic automata is use to facilitated the teacher which help teacher in\nidentification of students with learning disability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Oct 2013 09:25:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-22"}

Such identification may be performed\nwithout requiring line-of-sight alignment or physical contact between the RFID\ntag and the RFID reader, whilst tracking is naturally achieved due to the short\ninterrogation field of RFID readers. That is why the reduction in price of the\nRFID tags has been accompanied with an increasing attention paid to this\ntechnology. However, since tags are resource-constrained devices sending\nidentification data wirelessly, designing secure and private RFID\nidentification protocols is a challenging task. This scenario is even more\ncomplex when scalability must be met by those protocols.\n  Assuming the existence of a lightweight, secure, private and scalable RFID\nidentification protocol, there exist other concerns surrounding the RFID\ntechnology. Some of them arise from the technology itself, such as distance\nchecking, but others are related to the potential of RFID systems to gather\nhuge amount of tracking data. Publishing and mining such moving objects data is\nessential to improve efficiency of supervisory control, assets management and\nlocalisation, transportation, etc. However, obvious privacy threats arise if an\nindividual can be linked with some of those published trajectories. The present\ndissertation contributes to the design of algorithms and protocols aimed at\ndealing with the issues explained above. First, we propose a set of protocols\nand heuristics based on a distributed architecture that improve the efficiency\nof the identification process without compromising privacy or security.\nMoreover, we present a novel distance-bounding protocol based on graphs that is\nextremely low-resource consuming. Finally, we present two trajectory\nanonymisation methods aimed at preserving the individuals' privacy when their\ntrajectories are released.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Oct 2013 09:33:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-25"}

Recent radio observations indicate\nthat the jets turn off completely in the soft state, therefore multiwavelength\nmonitoring of black hole transients are essential to probe the formation of\njets. In this work we conducted a systematic study of all black hole transients\nwith near infrared and radio coverage during their outburst decays. We\ncharacterized the timescales of changes in X-ray spectral and temporal\nproperties and also in near infrared and/or in radio emission. We confirmed\nthat state transitions occur in black hole transients at a very similar\nfraction of their respective Eddington luminosities. We also found that the\nnear infrared flux increase that could be due to the formation of a compact jet\nis delayed by a time period of days with respect to the formation of a corona.\nFinally, we found a threshold disk Eddington luminosity fraction for the\ncompact jets to form. We explain these results with a model such that the\nincrease in the near infrared flux corresponds to a transition from a patchy,\nsmall scale height corona along with an optically thin out flow to a large\nscale height corona that allows for collimation of a steady compact jet. We\ndiscuss the timescale of jet formation in terms of transport of magnetic fields\nfrom the outer parts of the disk, and also consider two alternative\nexplanations for the multiwavelength emission: hot inner accretion flows and\nirradiation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Oct 2013 09:57:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

We show how a concrete system model can be\nbuilt on top of this meta-model via a set of Domain Specific Languages (DSLs),\nsupporting both formal verification and the generation of software and\ndocumentation artifacts. Finally we reason how the available semantics can be\nexposed at run-time by adding a \"semantic layer\" that can be browsed, queried,\nmonitored etc. by any OPC UA-enabled client.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Oct 2013 10:20:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-22"}

We use the fossil record\nto recover the star formation history (SFH) in spheroidal and disk dominated\ngalaxies with masses from 10$^9$ to 10$^{12}$ M$_\\odot$. We derive the half\nmass radius, and we find that galaxies are on average 15% more compact in mass\nthan in light. HMR/HLR decreases with increasing mass for disk galaxies, but is\nalmost constant in spheroidal galaxies. We find that the galaxy-averaged\nstellar population age, stellar extinction, and $\\mu$ are well represented by\ntheir values at 1 HLR. Negative radial gradients of the stellar population ages\nsupport an inside-out formation. The larger inner age gradients occur in the\nmost massive disk galaxies that have the most prominent bulges; shallower age\ngradients are obtained in spheroids of similar mass. Disk and spheroidal\ngalaxies show negative $\\mu$ gradients that steepen with stellar mass. In\nspheroidal galaxies $\\mu$ saturates at a critical value that is independent of\nthe galaxy mass. Thus, all the massive spheroidal galaxies have similar local\n$\\mu$ at the same radius (in HLR units). The SFH of the regions beyond 1 HLR\nare well correlated with their local $\\mu$, and follow the same relation as the\ngalaxy-averaged age and $\\mu$; suggesting that local stellar mass surface\ndensity preserves the SFH of disks. The SFH of bulges are, however, more\nfundamentally related to the total stellar mass, since the radial structure of\nthe stellar age changes with galaxy mass even though all the spheroid dominated\ngalaxies have similar radial structure in $\\mu$. Thus, galaxy mass is a more\nfundamental property in spheroidal systems while the local stellar mass surface\ndensity is more important in disks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Oct 2013 12:04:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-27"}

This change has unavoidable thermodynamic\nimplications. According to Boltzmann's microscopic interpretation of entropy, a\nshrinkage of the set of compatible states implies a decrease of entropy, which\neventually needs to be compensated by dissipation of heat and consequently\nrequires work. Examples are the compression of a gas and the erasure of\ninformation. On the other hand, in a spontaneous SB, the available phase space\nvolume changes without the need for work, yielding an apparent decrease of\nentropy.

The SB is\ninduced by a bistable potential created with two optical traps. The experiment\nconfirms theoretical results based on fluctuation theorems, allows us to\nreproduce the Szilard engine extracting energy from a single thermal bath, and\nshows that the signature of a SB in the energetics is measurable, providing new\nmethods to detect, for example, the coexistence of metastable states in\nmacromolecules.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Oct 2013 12:10:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

The second line\nof models is based on external drives and internal dynamics competing on\nsimilar time scales and includes the coherent noise model, which has a\nnon-critical steady state characterized by heavy-tailed distributions. The\nthird line of models proposes a non-critical self-organizing state, being\nguided by an optimization principle, such as the concept of highly optimized\ntolerance.\n  We present a comparative overview regarding distinct modeling approaches\ntogether with a discussion of their potential relevance as underlying\ngenerative models for real-world phenomena.

Using pressure ($p$)\nas a single control parameter of the C$_{60}$ balls lattice spacing, one can\nnow study the progressive evolution of the SC properties when the electronic\ncorrelations are increased towards the critical pressure $p_{c}$ of the Mott\ntransition. We have used $^{13}$C and $^{133}$Cs NMR measurements on the cubic\nphase A15-Cs$_{3}$C$_{60}$ just above $p_{c}=5.0(3)$ kbar, where the SC\ntransition temperature $T_{c}$ displays a dome shape with decreasing cell\nvolume. From the $T$ dependence below $T_{c}$ of the nuclear spin lattice\nrelaxation rate $(T_{1})^{-1}$ we determine the electronic excitations in the\nSC state, that is $2\\Delta$, the SC gap value. We find that $2\\Delta $\nincreases with decreasing $p$ towards $p_{c}$, where $T_{c}$ decreases on the\nSC dome, so that $2\\Delta /k_{B}T_{c}$ increases regularly upon approaching the\nMott transition. These results bring clear evidence that the increasing\ncorrelations near the Mott transition are not significantly detrimental to SC.\nThey rather suggest that repulsive electron interactions might even reinforce\nelecron-phonon SC, being then partly responsible for the large $T_{c}$ values,\nas proposed by theoretical models taking the electronic correlations as a key\ningredient.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Oct 2013 12:54:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Feb 2014 12:04:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 19 Feb 2014 09:28:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-20"}

As to the class of metal-poor GCs, we find the observed shape of the\nCMR (often referred to as the `blue tilt') to be very well reproduced by Bailin\n& Harris' reference self-enrichment model once 12 Gyr of GC mass loss is taken\ninto account. The influence of the IMF on this result is found to be\ninsignificant. However, we find that the observed CMR among the class of\nmetal-rich GCs (the `red tilt') can only be adequately reproduced if the IMF\nwas bottom-heavy (e.g., $-3.0 <~ \\alpha <~ -2.3$ in $dN/dM \\propto\nM^{\\alpha}$), which causes the stellar mass function at subsolar masses to\ndepend relatively strongly on GC mass.

In this mesoscopic framework, multiple attractors arise as emergent\nproperties of the nonlinear systems. The interplay between the stochasticity\nand nonlinearity leads to successive jump-like transitions among different\nbasins.

The slow-time\ndynamics of the nonlinear mesoscopic system is not deterministic, rather it is\na discrete stochastic jump process. The existence of these discrete states and\nthe Markov transitions among them are both emergent phenomena.

It is therefore important to make efficient use of\navailable computational resources, notably by minimizing the number of\ntemplates used to cover the signal parameter space of sky position and\nfrequency evolution. For searches over the sky, however, the required template\ndensity (determined by the parameter-space metric) is different at each sky\nposition, which makes it difficult in practice to achieve an efficient\ncovering. Previous work on this problem has found various choices of sky and\nfrequency coordinates that render the parameter-space metric approximately\nconstant, but which are limited to coherent integration times of either less\nthan a few days, or greater than several months. These limitations restrict the\nsensitivity achievable by hierarchical all-sky searches, and hinder the\ndevelopment of follow-up pipelines for interesting gravitational-wave pulsar\ncandidates. We present a new flat parameter-space metric approximation, and\nassociated sky and frequency coordinates, that do not suffer from these\nlimitations. Furthermore, the new metric is numerically well-conditioned, which\nfacilitates its practical use.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Oct 2013 15:09:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 2 Dec 2013 17:33:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-16"}

On one hand,\ndue to the irregular computation pattern and lack of locality, it is hard to\nexpress parallelism efficiently. On the other hand, due to the scale-free\nnature, real-world graphs are hard to partition in balance with low cut. To\naddress these challenges, several graph-parallel frameworks including Pregel\nand GraphLab (PowerGraph) have been developed recently. In this paper, we\npresent an alternative framework, Graph Runtime Engine (GRE). While retaining\nthe vertex-centric programming model, GRE proposes two new abstractions: 1) a\nScatter-Combine computation model based on active message to exploit massive\nfined-grained edge-level parallelism, and 2) a Agent-Graph data model based on\nvertex factorization to partition and represent directed graphs. GRE is\nimplemented on commercial off-the-shelf multi-core cluster. We experimentally\nevaluate GRE with three benchmark programs (PageRank, Single Source Shortest\nPath and Connected Components) on real-world and synthetic graphs of millions\nbillion of vertices. Compared to PowerGraph, GRE shows 2.5~17 times better\nperformance on 8~16 machines (192 cores). Specifically, the PageRank in GRE is\nthe fastest when comparing to counterparts of other frameworks (PowerGraph,\nSpark,Twister) reported in public literatures. Besides, GRE significantly\noptimizes memory usage so that it can process a large graph of 1 billion\nvertices and 17 billion edges on our cluster with totally 768GB memory, while\nPowerGraph can only process less than half of this graph scale.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Oct 2013 15:32:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-22"}

However, there's still a lack of comprehensive\nstudies on chunk scheduling for the smooth playout of layered streams in P2P\nnetworks. In these situations, a playout smoothing mechanism can be used to\nensure the uniform delivery of the layered stream. This can be achieved by\nreducing the quality changes that the stream undergoes when adapting to\nchanging network conditions. This paper complements previous efforts in\nthroughput maximization and delay minimization for P2P streaming by considering\nthe consequences of playout smoothing on the scheduling mechanisms for stream\nlayer acquisition. The two main problems to be considered when designing a\nplayout smoothing mechanism for P2P streaming are the fluctuation in available\nbandwidth between peers and the unreliability of user-contributed\nresources--particularly peer churn. Since the consideration of these two\nfactors in the selection and scheduling of stream layers is crucial to maintain\nsmooth stream playout, the main objective of our smoothing mechanism becomes\nthe determination of how many layers\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Oct 2013 14:21:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-20"}
