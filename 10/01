Yet, most of the photoionized gas in the Broad Line Region\n(BLR) follows Keplerian orbits, which suggests that the BLR originates from gas\nwith a large enough column for gravity to dominate.

We first review some of these\nknown results.\n  Then the main design problem addressed in this paper is the construction of\npairs of continuous inverse kinematics for arbitrary robot arms, with the\nproperty that the two inverse kinematics agree when the constrained\nconfiguration space has a single connected component, but they give distinct\nconfigurations (one in each connected component) when the configuration space\nof the constrained arm has two components. This design is made possible by a\nfundamental theoretical contribution in this paper -- a classification of\nconfiguration spaces of robot arms such that the type of path that the system\n(robot arm) takes through certain critical values of the forward kinematics\nfunction is completely determined by the class to which the configuration space\nof the arm belongs.

The Tsodyks and Markram (TM) model for STSP accurately\naccounts for a wide range of physiological responses at different types of\ncortical synapses. Here, we report for the first time a route to chaotic\nbehavior via a Shilnikov homoclinic bifurcation that dynamically organises some\nof the responses in the TM model. In particular, the presence of such a\nhomoclinic bifurcation strongly affects the shape of the trajectories in the\nphase space and induces highly irregular transient dynamics; indeed, in the\nvicinity of the Shilnikov homoclinic bifurcation, the number of population\nspikes and their precise timing are unpredictable and highly sensitive to the\ninitial conditions. Such an irregular deterministic dynamics has its\ncounterpart in stochastic/network versions of the TM model: the existence of\nthe Shilnikov homoclinic bifurcation generates complex and irregular spiking\npatterns and --acting as a sort of springboard-- facilitates transitions\nbetween the down-state and unstable periodic orbits.

It can be viewed as 3D\ngeneralization of graphene, with a unique electronic structure in which\nconduction and valence band energies touch each other only at isolated points\nin momentum space (i.e. the 3D Dirac points), and thus it cannot be classified\neither as a metal or a semiconductor. In contrast to graphene, the Dirac points\nof such a semimetal are not gapped by the spin-orbit interaction and the\ncrossing of the linear dispersions is protected by crystal symmetry. In\ncombination with broken time-reversal or inversion symmetries, 3D Dirac points\nmay result in a variety of topologically non-trivial phases with unique\nphysical properties. They have, however, escaped detection in real solids so\nfar. Here we report the direct observation of such an exotic electronic\nstructure in cadmium arsenide (Cd3As2) by means of angle-resolved photoemission\nspectroscopy (ARPES). We identify two momentum regions where electronic states\nthat strongly disperse in all directions form narrow cone-like structures, and\nthus prove the existence of the long sought 3D Dirac points. This electronic\nstructure naturally explains why Cd3As2 has one of the highest known bulk\nelectron mobilities. This realization of a 3D Dirac semimetal in Cd3As2 not\nonly opens a direct path to a wide spectrum of applications, but also offers a\nrobust platform for engineering topologically-nontrivial phases including Weyl\nsemimetals and Quantum Spin Hall systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Sep 2013 19:37:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-10"}

In this paper we\nintroduce a formal framework that can be used to determine whether or not a\nphysical system is performing a computation. We demonstrate how the abstract\ncomputational level interacts with the physical device level, drawing the\ncomparison with the use of mathematical models to represent physical objects in\nexperimental science. This powerful formulation allows a precise description of\nthe similarities between experiments, computation, simulation, and technology,\nleading to our central conclusion: physical computing is the use of a physical\nsystem to predict the outcome of an abstract evolution. We give conditions that\nmust be satisfied in order for computation to be occurring, and illustrate\nthese with a range of non-standard computing scenarios. The framework also\ncovers broader computing contexts, where there is no obvious human computer\nuser. We define the critical notion of a 'computational entity', and show the\nrole this plays in defining when computing is taking place in physical systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Sep 2013 19:37:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 7 Mar 2014 09:30:44 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 16 Jun 2014 08:40:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-21"}

Splitting\nthe star-formation budget by galaxy morphology, we find that early-type\ngalaxies (ETGs) host ~14% of the budget, while Sb/Sc galaxies host the bulk\n(~53%) of the local star formation activity. Recent work indicates that star\nformation in nearby ETGs is driven by minor mergers, implying that at least\n~14% of local star formation is triggered by this process. A more accurate\nestimate can be derived by noting that an infalling satellite likely induces a\nlarger starburst in a galaxy of 'later' morphological type, both due to higher\navailability of gas in the accreting galaxy and because a bigger bulge better\nstabilizes the disk against star formation. This enables us to use the star\nformation in ETGs to estimate a lower limit for the fraction of star formation\nin late-type galaxies (LTGs) that is minor-merger-driven. Using a subsample of\nETGs that is mass and environment-matched to the LTGs (implying a similar\ninfalling satellite population), we estimate this limit to be ~24%. Thus, a\nlower limit for the fraction of cosmic star formation that is induced by minor\nmergers is ~35% (14% [ETGs] + 0.24 x 86% [LTGs]). The observed positive\ncorrelation between black hole and galaxy mass further implies that a similar\nfraction of black hole accretion may also be triggered by minor mergers.\nDetailed studies of minor-merger remnants are therefore essential, to quantify\nthe role of this important process in driving stellar mass and black hole\ngrowth in the local Universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Sep 2013 20:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

There is also partially\nionized absorption in the non-dip (persistent) emission in both the high/soft\nstate and, very unusually, the low/hard state. However, this absorption (in\nboth states) has substantially lower ionization than that seen in other high\ninclination systems, where the material forms a homogeneous disk wind. Here\ninstead the absorption is most probably associated with clumpy, compact\nstructures associated with the dipping material, which we see uniquely in this\nsource likely because we view it at a very large inclination angle. A large\ninclination angle is also favored, together with a low black hole mass, to\nexplain the high disk temperature seen in the fairly low luminosity high/soft\nstate, as Doppler boosting enhances the disk temperature at high inclination.\nThe disk radius inferred from these data is significantly smaller than that of\nthe soft component seen in the low/hard state, supporting models where the disk\nis truncated at low luminosities.

The\ninitial conditions for the stellar disc were drawn from the results of previous\nsimulations of molecular cloud infall and disruption in the SMBH potential.

Furthermore, the distribution of orbit inclinations becomes\nsignificantly broader.

DeGroot's seminal idea is to base testing\nstatistical hypothesis on minimizing the weighted sum of type I plus type II\nerror instead of of the prevailing paradigm which is fixing type I error and\nminimizing type II error. DeGroot's result is that in simple vs simple\nhypothesis the optimal criterion is to reject, according to the likelihood\nratio as the evidence (ordering) statistics using a fixed threshold value,\ninstead of a fixed tail probability. By defining expected type I and type II\nerrors, we generalize DeGroot's approach and find that the optimal region is\ndefined by the ratio of evidences, that is, averaged likelihoods (with respect\nto a prior measure) and a threshold fixed. This approach yields an optimal\ntheory in complete generality, which the Classical Theory of Testing does not.\nThis can be seen as a Bayes-Non-Bayes compromise: the criteria (weighted sum of\ntype I and type II errors) is Frequentist, but the test criterion is the ratio\nof marginalized likelihood, which is Bayesian. We give arguments, to push the\ntheory still further, so that the weighting measures (priors)of the likelihoods\ndoes not have to be proper and highly informative, but just predictively\nmatched, that is that predictively matched priors, give rise to the same\nevidence (marginal likelihoods) using minimal (smallest) training samples. The\ntheory that emerges, similar to the theories based on Objective Bayes\napproaches, is a powerful response to criticisms of the prevailing approach of\nhypothesis testing, see for example Ioannidis (2005) and Siegfried (2010) among\nmany others.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Sep 2013 20:14:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-02"}

A\ndistributed storage system (DSS) is parameterized by three parameters (n, k,d),\nin which a file stored across n distributed nodes, can be recovered from any k\nout of n nodes. If a node fails, any d out of (n-1) nodes help in the repair of\nthe failed node. For such a (n,k,d)-DSS, two types of wiretapping scenarios are\ninvestigated: (a) Type-I (node) adversary which can wiretap the data stored on\nany l<k nodes; and a more severe (b) Type-II (repair data) adversary which can\nwiretap the contents of the repair data that is used to repair a set of l\nfailed nodes over time. The focus of this work is on the practically relevant\nsetting of exact repair regeneration in which the repair process must replace a\nfailed node by its exact replica. We make new progress on several non-trivial\ninstances of this problem which prior to this work have been open. The main\ncontribution of this paper is the optimal characterization of the secure\nstorage-vs-exact-repair-bandwidth tradeoff region of a (n,k,d)-DSS, with n<=4\nand any l<k in the presence of both Type-I and Type-II adversaries.

The key technical\ncontribution of this work is in developing novel information theoretic converse\nproofs for the Type-II adversarial scenario. From our results, we show that in\nthe presence of Type-II attacks, the only efficient point in the\nstorage-vs-exact-repair-bandwidth tradeoff is the MBR (minimum bandwidth\nregenerating) point.

Because regulations reduce profits to those possessing unfair\nadvantage, these advantaged corporations (whether individuals, companies, or\nother collective organizations) are motivated to influence regulators.\nRegulatory bodies created to protect the market are instead co-opted to advance\nthe interests of the corporations they are charged to regulate. This\nwide-spread influence, known as \"regulatory capture,\" has been recognized for\nover 100 years, and according to expectations of rational behavior, will exist\nwherever it is in the mutual self-interest of corporations and regulators. Here\nwe model the interaction between corporations and regulators using a new game\ntheory framework explicitly accounting for players' mutual influence, and\ndemonstrate the incentive for collusion. Communication between corporations and\nregulators enables them to collude and split the resulting profits. We identify\nwhen collusion is profitable for both parties. The intuitive results show that\ncapture occurs when the benefits to the corporation outweigh the costs to the\nregulator. Under these conditions, the corporation can compensate the regulator\nfor costs incurred and, further, provide a profit to both parties. In the real\nworld, benefits often far outweigh costs, providing large incentives to collude\nand making capture likely. Regulatory capture is inhibited by decreasing the\ninfluence between parties through strict separation, independent market\nknowledge and research by regulators, regulatory and market transparency,\nregulatory accountability for market failures, widely distributed regulatory\ncontrol, and anti-corruption enforcement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Sep 2013 21:13:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-02"}

However, as we\nshow in this work, despite the nonlinearity, reliable communication is still\npossible. Furthermore, this work motivates future studies on more realistic\nmodelling, analysis, and design of theoretical models and algorithms for these\nsystems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Sep 2013 21:46:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-05"}

The\nSTIS and WFC3 spectra differ significantly in absolute radius level (4.3 +/-\n1.6 pressure scale heights), implying strong optical absorption in the\natmosphere of HAT-P-1b. The optical to near-infrared difference cannot be\nexplained by stellar activity, as simulta- neous stellar activity monitoring of\nthe G0V HAT-P-1b host star and its identical companion show no significant\nactivity that could explain the result. We compare the complete STIS and WFC3\ntransmission spectrum with theoretical atmospheric mod- els which include haze,\nsodium and an extra optical absorber. We find that both an optical absorber and\na super-solar sodium to water abundance ratio might be a sce- nario explaining\nthe HAT-P-1b observations. Our results suggest that strong optical absorbers\nmay be a dominant atmospheric feature in some hot Jupiter exoplanets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Sep 2013 22:34:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

The dose\nreconstruction is performed in a spherical water phantom by modulating, based\non EPID measurements, pre-calculated Monte Carlo (MC) doselets defined on a\nspherical coordinate system. This is called the spherical doselet modulation\n(SDM) method. This technique essentially eliminates the statistical uncertainty\nof the MC dose calculations by exploiting both azimuthal symmetry in a\npatient-independent phase-space and symmetry of a virtual spherical water\nphantom. The symmetry also allows the number of doselets necessary for dose\nreconstruction to be reduced by a factor of about 250. In this work, 51\ndoselets were used.

The arm and\ninterarm regions being defined based on a spatially filtered stellar component\nmodel image, we measure the arm-to-interarm contrast for each band. The\ncontrast is lowest in the S11 image, which is interpreted as that among the\nfour AKARI MIR bands the S11 image best correlates with the spatial\ndistribution of dust grains including colder components, while the L24 image\nwith the highest contrast traces warmer dust heated by star forming activities.\nThe surface brightness ratio between the bands, i.e. color, is measured over\nthe disk of the main galaxy, M51a, at 300 pc resolution.

More often than\nnot, modern scientific findings rely on statistical analysis of\nhigh-dimensional data. At a minimum, reproducibility manifests itself in\nstability of statistical results relative to \"reasonable\" perturbations to data\nand to the model used. Jacknife, bootstrap, and cross-validation are based on\nperturbations to data, while robust statistics methods deal with perturbations\nto models. In this article, a case is made for the importance of stability in\nstatistics. Firstly, we motivate the necessity of stability for interpretable\nand reliable encoding models from brain fMRI signals. Secondly, we find strong\nevidence in the literature to demonstrate the central role of stability in\nstatistical inference, such as sensitivity analysis and effect detection.\nThirdly, a smoothing parameter selector based on estimation stability (ES),\nES-CV, is proposed for Lasso, in order to bring stability to bear on\ncross-validation (CV). ES-CV is then utilized in the encoding models to reduce\nthe number of predictors by 60% with almost no loss (1.3%) of prediction\nperformance across over 2,000 voxels. Last, a novel \"stability\" argument is\nseen to drive new results that shed light on the intriguing interactions\nbetween sample to sample variability and heavier tail error distribution (e.g.,\ndouble-exponential) in high-dimensional regression models with $p$ predictors\nand $n$ independent samples.

We show that it is not\nnecessary to assume joint incoherence, which is a standard but unintuitive and\nrestrictive condition that is imposed by previous studies. This leads to a\nsample complexity bound that is order-wise optimal with respect to the\nincoherence parameter (as well as to the rank $r$ and the matrix dimension $n$\nup to a log factor). As a consequence, we improve the sample complexity of\nrecovering a semidefinite matrix from $O(nr^{2}\\log^{2}n)$ to $O(nr\\log^{2}n)$,\nand the highest allowable rank from $\\Theta(\\sqrt{n}/\\log n)$ to\n$\\Theta(n/\\log^{2}n)$. The key step in proof is to obtain new bounds on the\n$\\ell_{\\infty,2}$-norm, defined as the maximum of the row and column norms of a\nmatrix. To illustrate the applicability of our techniques, we discuss\nextensions to SVD projection, structured matrix completion and semi-supervised\nclustering, for which we provide order-wise improvements over existing results.\nFinally, we turn to the closely-related problem of low-rank-plus-sparse matrix\ndecomposition.

The\nprominence first goes through a slow rise (SR) phase followed by a fast rise\n(FR). The slow rise phase started after a couple of small brightenings seen\ntoward the footpoints. At the turning point from SR to FR, the prominence had\nalready become kinked. The prominence shows strong brightening at the central\nkink location during the start of FR. We interpret this as internal magnetic\nreconnection occurring at a vertical current sheet forming between the two legs\nof the erupting prominence (flux-rope). The brightening at the central kink\nlocation is seen in all the EUV channels of AIA. The contributions of\ndifferential emission at higher temperatures are larger compared to that for\ntypical coronal temperatures supporting a reconnection scenario at the central\nkink location. The plasma above the brightening location gets ejected as a hot\nplasmoid-like structure embedded in a CME, and those below drain down in the\nform of blobs moving towards the Sun's surface. The unique time resolution of\nthe AIA has allowed all of these eruptive aspects, including SR-to-FR, kinking,\ncentral current sheet formation, plasmoid-like eruption, and filament\n\"splitting\", to be observed in a single event, providing strong and\ncomprehensive evidence in favour of the model of partially erupting flux ropes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Oct 2013 07:15:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

The\ncontributions of this paper are the proposed framework and an implementation\nthat properly handles its inherent issues of loss of locality and combinatorial\nexplosion, showing its viability for real-time applications. In particular, we\nintroduce the novel concept of keytuples to solve a running time issue. The\naccuracy of the implementation is shown by results of over 800 experiments with\na well-known database of images. The speed is illustrated by real-time tracking\nwith two different cameras in ordinary hardware.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Oct 2013 07:45:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-02"}

This is principally because in absence of money, very little can be\ndone to enforce truthfulness.

For example, in Combinatorial Auctions (CAs), the\nparadigmatic problem of the area, we aim at solutions of maximum social welfare\nbut still charge the society to ensure truthfulness. Additionally, truthfulness\nof CAs is poorly understood already in the case in which bidders happen to be\ninterested in only two different sets of goods.\n  We focus on the design of incentive-compatible CAs without money in the\ngeneral setting of $k$-minded bidders. We trade monetary transfers with the\nobservation that the mechanism can detect certain lies of the bidders: i.e., we\nstudy truthful CAs with verification and without money.

A rapid increase of the number of terms contributing to the\nchiral three-nucleon force when increasing the order of the chiral expansion\nfrom N2LO to N3LO forced us to develop a fast and effective method of\nautomatized partial wave decomposition. At low energies of the incoming nucleon\nbelow about 20MeV, where only a limited number of partial waves is required,\nthis method allowed us to perform calculations of reactions in the\nthree-nucleon continuum using N3LO two- and three-nucleon forces.

A viable solution is thus a gradual\nmigration over time, where questions of which routers should migrate first, and\nwhether the order of migration makes a difference, can be analyzed from techno\neconomic and traffic engineering perspective. In this paper, we address these\nquestions from the techno economic perspective, and establish the importance of\nmigration scheduling. We propose optimization techniques and greedy algorithms\nto plan an effective migration schedule, based on various techno economic\naspects, such as technological gains in combinations with CapEx limitations. We\ndemonstrate the importance of an effective migration sequence through two\nrelevant network management metrics, namely, number of alternative paths\navailed by a node on migration, and network capacity savings.

We argue that holographic dualities are a very efficient\nframework for studying transport properties in such a medium.\n  Next, we introduce the underlying physics behind all holographic dualities,\nthe AdS/CFT correspondence, and then motivate the necessity of implementing\nconformal invariance breaking in them.

To\ndistinguish accreting binaries from chromospherically active objects we develop\nand explain criteria based on Halpha and HeI 5786,6678 emission line properties\navailable in the literature. The spectroscopic properties and photometric\nvariability of all the objects are discussed and a classification of the source\nis given where possible.

Time-resolved photometry and the large broadening of the Halpha emission\nlines in CX446 (2100 km/s FWHM) suggest that this is also an eclipsing or\nhigh-inclination accreting binary.

Here we demonstrate that hydrogenation on the surface of MoS2\nmonolayer induces a semiconductor-metal transition, and strip-patterned\nhydrogenation is able to generate a conducting nanoroad. The band-gap closing\narises from the formation of in-gap hybridized states mainly consisting of Mo\n4d orbitals, as well as the electron donation from hydrogen to the lattice\nhost. Ballistic conductance calculations reveal that such a nanoroad on the\nMoS2 surface exhibits an integer conductance, indicating small carrier\nscattering, and thus is ideal for serving as a conducting channel or\ninterconnect without compromising the mechanical and structural integrity of\nthe monolayer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Oct 2013 10:44:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-21"}

In this\narchitecture, all the baseband signal processing is shifted to a single\nbaseband unit (BBU) pool, which enables efficient resource allocation and\ninterference management. Meanwhile, conventional powerful base stations can be\nreplaced by low-cost low-power remote radio heads (RRHs), producing a green and\nlow-cost infrastructure. However, as all the RRHs need to be connected to the\nBBU pool through optical transport links, the transport network power\nconsumption becomes significant. In this paper, we propose a new framework to\ndesign a green Cloud-RAN, which is formulated as a joint RRH selection and\npower minimization beamforming problem. To efficiently solve this problem, we\nfirst propose a greedy selection algorithm, which is shown to provide near-\noptimal performance. To further reduce the complexity, a novel group sparse\nbeamforming method is proposed by inducing the group-sparsity of beamformers\nusing the weighted $\\ell_1/\\ell_2$-norm minimization, where the group sparsity\npattern indicates those RRHs that can be switched off. Simulation results will\nshow that the proposed algorithms significantly reduce the network power\nconsumption and demonstrate the importance of considering the transport link\npower consumption.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Oct 2013 10:46:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-02"}

Both parameters do not correlate with line-of-sight velocity\ndifference dV of galaxies. Dp and P are better measures of interaction strength\nthan dV. The latter correlates with the density of large-scale environment and\nwith the morphologies of galaxies.

The situation for wireless networks is no different\nresulting in a lot of complexity and a plethora of largely incompatible\nwireless technologies. The emergence of \"programmable wireless networks\", that\nallow greater flexibility, ease of management and configurability, is a step in\nthe right direction to overcome the aforementioned shortcomings of the wireless\nnetworks. In this paper, we provide a broad overview of the architectures\nproposed in literature for building programmable wireless networks focusing\nprimarily on three popular techniques, i.e., software defined networks,\ncognitive radio networks, and virtualized networks.

We selected a subsample\nof the Hamburg/ESO survey for bright UV-excess QSOs, containing only the 99\nnearest QSOs with redshift z<=0.06, that are close enough to allow detailed\nstructural analysis. From this \"low-luminosity type-1 QSO sample\", we observed\n20 galaxies and performed aperture photometry and\nbulge-disk-bar-AGN-decomposition with BUDDA on near-infrared J, H, K band\nimages. From the photometric decomposition of these 20 objects and visual\ninspection of images of another 26, we find that ~50% of the hosts are disk\ngalaxies and most of them (86%) are barred. Stellar masses, calculated from\nparametric models based on inactive galaxy colors, range from 2x10^9 M_sun to\n2x10^11 M_sun. Black hole masses measured from single epoch spectroscopy range\nfrom 1x10^6 M_sun to 5x10^8 M_sun. In comparison to higher luminosity QSO\nsamples, LLQSOs tend to have lower stellar and BH masses. Also, in the\neffective radius vs. mean surface-brightness projection of the fundamental\nplane, they lie in the transition area between luminous QSOs and \"normal\"\ngalaxies. This can be seen as further evidence that they can be pictured as a\n\"bridge\" between the local Seyfert population and luminous QSOs at higher\nredshift. Eleven low-luminosity QSOs for which we have reliable morphological\ndecompositions and BH mass estimations lie below the published BH mass vs.\nbulge luminosity relations for inactive galaxies. This could be partially\nexplained by bulges of active galaxies containing much younger stellar\npopulations than bulges of inactive galaxies. Also, one could suspect that\ntheir BHs are undermassive. This might hint at the growth of the host spheroid\nto precede that of the BH.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Oct 2013 12:53:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Dec 2013 09:56:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

Traditionally, Bell inequalities have\nbeen used to describe the restrictions imposed by causal structures on marginal\ndistributions. However, some structures give rise to non-convex constraints on\nthe accessible data, and it has recently been noted that linear inequalities on\nthe observable entropies capture these situations more naturally. In this\npaper, we show the versatility of the entropic approach by greatly expanding\nthe set of scenarios for which entropic constraints are known. For the first\ntime, we treat Bell scenarios involving multiple parties and multiple\nobservables per party. Going beyond the usual Bell setup, we exhibit\ninequalities for scenarios with extra conditional independence assumptions, as\nwell as a limited amount of shared randomness between the parties.

In some situations the converse also holds, which\nprovides us with a rich source of candidate entropic inequalities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Oct 2013 13:26:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 6 Oct 2013 14:41:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-02"}

Like other\nalgorithms based on the Retinex model, RSR also provides local illumination\nestimation and brightness adjustment for each pixel and it is faster than other\npath-wise Retinex algorithms. As the assumption of the uniform illumination\nholds in many cases, it should be possible to use the mean of local\nillumination estimations of RSR as a global illumination estimation for images\nwith (assumed) uniform illumination allowing also the accuracy to be easily\nmeasured. Therefore we propose a method for estimating global illumination\nestimation based on local RSR results. To our best knowledge this is the first\ntime that RSR algorithm is used to obtain global illumination estimation. For\nour tests we use a publicly available color constancy image database for\ntesting.

The aim of this\nstudy is to determine how the strength of the sustained, non-linear corotation\ntorque experienced by embedded planets varies as a function of orbital\neccentricity, disc parameters, and planetary mass. In agreement with previous\nwork we find that the corotation torque diminishes as orbital eccentricity,\n$e$, increases. Analysis of the time-averaged streamlines in the disc\ndemonstrates that the width of the horseshoe region narrows as the eccentricity\nincreases, and we suggest that this narrowing largely explains the observed\ndecrease in the corotation torque. We employ three distinct methods for\nestimating the strength of the unsaturated corotation torque from our\nsimulations, and provide an empirical fit to these results. We find that a\nsimple model where the corotation torque, $\\Gamma_C$, decreases exponentially\nwith increasing eccentricity (i.e. $\\Gamma_C \\propto \\exp{(-e/e_f)}$) provides\na good global fit to the data with an e-folding eccentricity, $e_f$, that\nscales linearly with the disc scale height at the planet location. We confirm\nthat this model provides a good fit for planet masses of 5 and 10 $\\Me$ in our\nsimulations.

As even very low error rates can limit\npractical usage of such systems, methods that perform closer to human accuracy\nremain desirable. In this work, we propose a new type of network with the\nfollowing properties that address what we hypothesize to be limiting aspects of\nexisting methods: (1) a `wide' structure with thousands of features, (2) a\nlarge field of view, (3) recursive iterations that exploit statistical\ndependencies in label space, and (4) a parallelizable architecture that can be\ntrained in a fraction of the time compared to benchmark multilayer\nconvolutional networks. For the specific image labeling problem of boundary\nprediction, we also introduce a novel example weighting algorithm that improves\nsegmentation accuracy. Experiments in the challenging domain of connectomic\nreconstruction of neural circuity from 3d electron microscopy data show that\nthese \"Deep And Wide Multiscale Recursive\" (DAWMR) networks lead to new levels\nof image labeling performance. The highest performing architecture has twelve\nlayers, interwoven supervised and unsupervised stages, and uses an input field\nof view of 157,464 voxels ($54^3$) to make a prediction at each image location.\nWe present an associated open source software package that enables the simple\nand flexible creation of DAWMR networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Oct 2013 15:42:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 30 Oct 2013 21:16:45 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 6 Dec 2013 17:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-09"}

Their kinematics\nlooks very similar to that of the standard tops events, which leads to events\nwith little or no excess of missing transverse energy. This complicates the\nprobing of this region of the stop parameter space by hadron colliders,\nrendering the application of standard searching techniques challenging. In this\nSnowmass white paper we reanalyze the spin correlation approach to the search\nof stealth stops, focusing on the feasibility of this search at the 14 TeV LHC.\nWe find, while the statistical limitations significantly shrink compared to the\nlow-luminosity 8 TeV run, the systematic PDF uncertainties pose the main\nobstacle. We show that the current understanding of PDFs probably does not\nallow us to talk about top and stop discrimination via spin correlation in the\ninclusive sample. On the other hand the systematic uncertainties significantly\nshrink if only events with low center of mass energy are considered, rendering\nthe search in this region feasible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Oct 2013 15:44:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-02"}
