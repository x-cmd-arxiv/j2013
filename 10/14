Among these\nrelationships, social links among users are of great importance. Many existing\nlink prediction methods focus on predicting social links that will appear in\nthe future among all users based upon a snapshot of the social network. In\nreal-world social networks, many new users are joining in the service every\nday. Predicting links for new users are more important. Different from\nconventional link prediction problems, link prediction for new users are more\nchallenging due to the following reasons: (1) differences in information\ndistributions between new users and the existing active users (i.e., old\nusers); (2) lack of information from the new users in the network. We propose a\nlink prediction method called SCAN-PS (Supervised Cross Aligned Networks link\nprediction with Personalized Sampling), to solve the link prediction problem\nfor new users with information transferred from both the existing active users\nin the target network and other source networks through aligned accounts. We\nproposed a within-target-network personalized sampling method to process the\nexisting active users' information in order to accommodate the differences in\ninformation distributions before the intra-network knowledge transfer. SCAN-PS\ncan also exploit information in other source networks, where the user accounts\nare aligned with the target network. In this way, SCAN-PS could solve the cold\nstart problem when information of these new users is total absent in the target\nnetwork.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Oct 2013 16:35:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-15"}

In the opposite \"dirty limit\" the\ndensity-of-states correction is a non-monotonous function of energy and\ntemperature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Oct 2013 20:07:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

The\ninfluences of the geometrical parameters along with the refractive index of the\ndielectric on the device performance are discussed as well.

It is also\ndisplayed that the total absorption efficiency gradually increases when there\nare more metal-dielectric unit cells placing on top of the metallic substrate.\nOur work is expected to have some potential applications in the areas of solar\nenergy harvesting and thermal emission tailoring.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Oct 2013 03:03:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Oct 2013 01:05:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-16"}

After removing compact X-ray features, diffuse X-ray\nemission is clearly detected and is well reproduced by a three-component\nspectral model consisting of unabsorbed thermal emission (temperature kT ~0.1\nkeV from the Local Bubble (LB), absorbed kT ~0.3 keV thermal emission related\nto the NPS and/or Galactic Halo (GH), and a power-law component at a level\nconsistent with the cosmic X-ray background. The emission measure (EM) of the\n0.3 keV plasma decreases by ~50% toward the inner regions of the north-east\nbubble, with no accompanying temperature change. However, such a jump in the EM\nis not clearly seen in the south bubble data. While it is unclear if the NPS\noriginates from a nearby supernova remnant or is related to previous activity\nwithin/around the Galactic Center, our Suzaku observations provide evidence\nsuggestive of the latter scenario. In the latter framework, the presence of a\nlarge amount of neutral matter absorbing the X-ray emission as well as the\nexistence of the kT ~ 0.3 keV gas can be naturally interpreted as a weak shock\ndriven by the bubbles' expansion in the surrounding medium, with velocity v_exp\n~300 km/s (corresponding to shock Mach number M ~1.5), compressing the GH gas\nto form the NPS feature. We also derived an upper limit for any non-thermal\nX-ray emission component associated with the bubbles and demonstrate, that in\nagreement with the findings above, the non-thermal pressure and energy\nestimated from a one-zone leptonic model of its broad-band spectrum, are in\nrough equilibrium with that of the surrounding thermal plasma.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Oct 2013 03:31:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 Feb 2014 13:36:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

Nevertheless, the existing\ncache management scheme for the network of caches obtain poor performance. The\nmain reason for performance degradation in a network of caches is the filter\neffect of the replacement policy. A cache serves the requests that generate\ncache-hits and forwards the requests that generate cache-misses. This filtering\nchanges the pattern of requests and leads to decreased hit ratios in the\nsubsequent caches. In this paper, we propose a coordinated caching scheme to\nsolve the filter effect problem by introducing the selection policy. This\npolicy manages a cache such that: i) the cache obtains a high hit ratio ii) the\nmissed requests from the cache can be used by subsequent caches to obtain a\nhigh hit ratio. Our coordinated selection scheme achieves an overall hit ratio\nof a network of caches equivalent to that of edge routers with big caches.\nMoreover, our scheme decreases the average number of evictions per cache slot\nby four order of magnitude compared to the LRU universal caching.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Oct 2013 07:46:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-15"}

The distribution of the\naxial ratios in position space is found to be well approximated by a Gaussian\nwith a mean 0.66+/-0.01 and a dispersion 0.07+/-0.008. The velocity ellipsoids\nrepresenting the shapes in velocity space are more spherical, with a mean axial\nratio of 0.78+/-0.03. This finding has important implications for mass\nmeasurements based on the line of sight velocity dispersion profiles in\nindividual clusters. For typical axial ratios of the velocity ellipsoids in the\nanalysed cluster sample, systematic errors on the mass estimates inferred from\nthe line of sight velocity dispersions become comparable to statistical\nuncertainties for galaxy clusters with as few as 40 spectroscopic redshifts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Oct 2013 10:53:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Nov 2013 10:52:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 29 Jan 2014 16:01:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-30"}

The first version (Alexander & Gieles) assumed that\ncluster evolution is balanced for the majority of the life-cycle, meaning that\nthe rate of energy generation in the core of the cluster equals the diffusion\nrate of energy by two-body relaxation, which makes the code suitable for\nmodelling clusters in weak tidal fields. In this new version we extend the\nmodel to include an unbalanced phase of evolution to describe the pre-collapse\nevolution and the accompanying escape rate such that clusters in strong tidal\nfields can also be modelled. We also add a prescription for the evolution of\nthe core radius and density and a related cluster concentration parameter. The\nmodel simultaneously solves a series of first-order ordinary differential\nequations for the rate of change of the core radius, half-mass radius and the\nnumber of member stars N. About two thousand integration steps in time are\nrequired to solve for the entire evolution of a star cluster and this number is\napproximately independent of N. We compare the model to the variation of these\nparameters following from a series of direct N-body calculations of single-mass\nclusters and find good agreement in the evolution of all parameters. Relevant\ntime-scales, such as the total lifetimes and core collapse times, are\nreproduced with an accuracy of about 10% for clusters with various initial\nhalf-mass radii (relative to their Jacobi radii) and a range of different\ninitial N up to N = 65536. We intend to extend this framework to include more\nrealistic initial conditions, such as a stellar mass spectrum and mass loss\nfrom stars.

One usually think that it is extremely\nimportant for the measurement of triple Higgs coupling at the high luminosity\nLHC. In this paper, we propose to search for the extra Higgs boson (denoted as\n$S$) utilizing pair production of the SM-like Higgs boson ($H$) which was\ndiscovered in July, 2012.The pair production of $H$ can be huge due to the\nresonant production of heavy scalar $S$, namely $PP \\rightarrow S \\rightarrow\nHH$. The couplings of $H$ with weak gauge boson are similar to ones in the SM\nand it implies that the couplings between $S$ and gauge bosons are likely\nsuppressed. Provided that $S$ is heavy enough, the decay into weak gauge bosons\nmay not be the dominant modes. Instead $S$ can decay into a pair of $H$ and\noffer the promising channel to discover it. In this paper, we studied the 5\npromising decay modes of $H$, i.e. $b\\bar{b}$, $WW^*$, $ZZ^*$, $\\gamma\\gamma$\nand $\\tau^+\\tau^-$, and simulated the signals and backgrounds for the 15\ncombination modes for $HH$ at the LHC with $\\sqrt{s}= 14$ TeV and integrated\nluminosity $\\mathcal{L}=1000fb^{-1}$.

One of the most promising scenarios to assemble\nsupermassive black holes is a monolithic collapse of protogalactic gas clouds\nin atomic cooling halos with $\\rm T_{vir} \\geq 10^{4} K$. In this article, we\nstudy the amplification and impact of magnetic fields during the formation of\nseed black holes in massive primordial halos. We perform high resolution\ncosmological magnetohydrodynamics simulations for four distinct halos and\nfollow their collapse for a few free-fall times until the simulations reach a\npeak density of $\\rm 7 \\times 10^{-10} g/cm^{3}$. Our findings show that\nirrespective of the initial seed field, the magnetic field strength reaches a\nsaturated state in the presence of strong accretion shocks. Under such\nconditions, the growth time becomes very short and amplification occurs rapidly\nwithin a small fraction of the free-fall time. We find that the presence of\nsuch strong magnetic fields provides additional support against gravity and\nhelps in suppressing fragmentation. Massive clumps of a few hundred solar\nmasses are formed at the end of our simulations and high accretion rates of\n$\\rm 1 M_{\\odot}/yr$ are observed.

The lattice\ncohomology is an important tool in the study of topological properties of a\nplumbed 3-manifold M associated with a connected negative definite plumbing\ngraph G. It connects the topological properties with analytic ones when M is\nrealized as a singularity link, i.e. when G is a good resolution graph of the\nsingularity. Its computation is based on the (Riemann-Roch) weights of the\nlattice points of \\Z^s, where s is the number of vertices of G. The first part\nof the thesis reduces the rank of this lattice to the number of `bad' vertices\nof the graph. Usually, the geometry/topology of M is encoded exactly by these\n`bad' vertices and their number measures how far the plumbing graph stays from\na rational one. In the second part, we identify the following three objects:\nthe Seiberg-Witten invariant of a plumbed 3-manifold, the periodic constant of\nits topological Poincare series, and a coefficient of an equivariant\nmultivariable Ehrhart polynomial. For this, we construct the corresponding\npolytope from the plumbing graph, together with an action of H_1(M,\\Z), and we\ndevelop Ehrhart theory for them. The effect of the reduction appears also at\nthe level of the multivariable topological Poincare series, simplifying the\ncorresponding polytope and the Ehrhart theory as well. We end the thesis with\ndetailed calculations and examples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Oct 2013 13:40:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-15"}

Classical analyses make use of the\nintensity of bright collisionally excited lines (CELs), which have a strong\ndependence on the electron temperature and density. By using high resolution\nspectrophotometric data, our group has led the determination of chemical\nabundances of some heavy element ions, mainly O++, O+ and C++ from faint\nrecombination lines (RLs), allowing us to deblend them from other nearby\nemission lines or sky features. The importance of these lines is that their\nemissivity depends weakly on the temperature and density structure of the gas.\nThe unresolved issue in this field is that recombination lines of heavy element\nions give abundances that are about 2-3 times higher than those derived from\nCELs -in H II regions- for the same ion, and can even be a factor of 70 times\nhigher in some PNe. This uncertainty puts into doubt the validity of face\nvalues of metallicity that we use as representative not only for ionized\nnebulae in the Local Universe, but also for star-forming dwarf and spiral\ngalaxies at different redshifts. Additionally, high-resolution data can allow\nus to detect and deblend faint lines of neutron capture element ions in PNe.\nThis information would introduce further restrictions to evolution models of\nAGBs and would help to quantify the chemical enrichment in s-elements produced\nby low and intermediate mass stars. The availability of an echelle spectrograph\nat the E-ELT will be of paramount interest to: (a) extend the studies of heavy\nelement recombination lines to low metallicity objects, (b) to extend abundance\ndeterminations of s-elements to planetary nebulae in the extragalactic domain\nand to bright Galactic and extragalactic H II regions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Oct 2013 13:40:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

Such\nrepresentations are used to specify a prior measure in Bayesian nonparametric\nwavelet regression. Investigating regularity of such functions is an important\nproblem since the support of the posterior measure does not include functions\nthat are not in the support of the prior measure, and therefore determines the\nfunctions that are possible to estimate using specified Bayesian model. We\nconsider a more general parametrisation than has been studied previously which\nallows to study a priori regularity of functions under a wider class of priors.\nWe also emphasise the difference between the abstract stochastic expansions\nthat have been studied in the literature, and the expansions actually arising\nin nonparametric regression, and show that the latter cover a wider class of\nfunctions than the former.

Furthermore,\nwe propose to further restrict the allowable information flow by adding filter\nfunctions for controlling which messages may be transmitted between processes,\nand we prove that locally checking filter functions is sufficient for ensuring\nglobal security policies. Altogether, global intransitive security policies are\nestablished by means of local verification conditions for the (trusted)\nprocesses of the distributed system.

Using\na high speed movie camera mounted on a lathe bed that recorded magnified images\nin a frame of reference moving with the flow, they observed the motions of\nsub-micron particles in the sub-, buffer- and log-layers. Surprisingly, these\nmotions were not nearly so locally random as was the general view of turbulence\nat the time. Rather, connected regions of the near wall flow decelerated and\nthen erupted away from the wall in what they called \"ejections\".
