Studies of these topics with Band 1 receivers\nwill significantly expand ALMA's Level 1 Science Goals.

Still, one might guess that the measure-theoretic\ndeterministic systems which are observationally equivalent to stochastic\nprocesses used in science do not include any deterministic systems used in\nscience.

Transport equations are a novel\nmethod for handling this variability via a distributed parameter; where\nparticular parameter values are possessed by various proportions of the\npopulation.

A standard method\nto lexicographically sort general data is to iteratively use a stable sort -- a\nsort which preserves existing orders. Here we present a new method of\nlexicographical sorting called QuickLexSort. Whereas a stable sort based\nlexicographical sorting algorithm operates from the least important to most\nimportant features, in contrast, QuickLexSort sorts from the most important to\nleast important features, refining the sort as it goes. QuickLexSort first\nrequires a one-time modest pre-processing step where each feature of the data\nset is sorted independently. When lexicographically sorting a database,\nQuickLexSort (including pre-processing) has comparable running time to using a\nstable sort based approach. For a data base with $m$ rows and $n$ columns, and\na sorting algorithm running in time $O(mlog(m))$, a stable sort based\nlexicographical sort and QuickLexSort will both take time $O(nmlog(m))$.\nHowever in many applications one has the need to lexicographically sort nested\ndata, e.g.\\ all possible sub-matrices up to a certain cardinality of columns.\nIn such cases we show QuickLexSort gives a performance improvement of a log\nfactor of the database length (rows in matrix) over using a standard stable\nsort based approach. E.g.\\ to sort all sub-matrices up to cardinality $k$,\nQuickLexSort has running time $O(mn^k)$ whereas a stable sort based\nlexicographical sort will take time $O(mlog(m)n^k)$. After the pre-processing\nstep that is run only once for the entire matrix, QuickLexSort has a running\ntime linear in the number of nested sub-matrices to sort.

An early formulation of the genome assembly problem showed that\ngenome reconstruction is NP-hard when framed as finding the shortest sequence\nthat contains all observed reads. Although this original formulation is very\nsimplistic and does not allow for mate-pair information, subsequent\nformulations have also proven to be NP-hard, and/or may not be guaranteed to\nreturn a correct assembly.\n  In this paper, we provide an alternate perspective on the genome assembly\nproblem by showing genome assembly is easy when provided with sufficient\nmate-pair information. Moreover, we quantify the number of mate-pair libraries\nnecessary and sufficient for accurate genome assembly, in terms of the length\nof the longest repetitive region within a genome. In our analysis, we consider\nan idealized sequencing model where each mate-pair library generates pairs of\nerror free reads with a fixed and known insert size at each position in the\ngenome.\n  Even in this idealized model, we show that accurate genome reconstruction\ncannot be guaranteed in the worst case unless at least roughly R/2L mate-pair\nlibraries are produced, where R is the length of the longest repetitive region\nin the genome and L is the length of each read. On the other hand, if (R/L)+1\nmate-pair libraries are provided, then a simple algorithm can be used to find a\ncorrect genome assembly easily in polynomial time. Although (R/L)+1 mate-pair\nlibraries can be too much to produce in practice, the previous bounds only hold\nin the worst case. In our last result, we show that if additional conditions\nhold on a genome, a correct assembly can be guaranteed with only O(log (R/L))\nmate-pair libraries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Oct 2013 01:45:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Oct 2013 16:14:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 27 Dec 2013 16:33:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-30"}

In this paper, we present a scaling law for\nrecovering the sparse vector from a subspace that is spanned by the sparse\nvector and $k$ random vectors. We prove that the sparse vector will be the\noutput to one of $n$ linear programs with high probability if its support size\n$s$ satisfies $s \\lesssim n/\\sqrt{k \\log n}$.

This present\nwork proposes an analytical solution to the free-surface elevation around a\ncircular cylinder in plane progressive waves. It is assumed throughout that the\nhorizontal extent of the cylinder is much smaller than the incident wavelength\nand of the same order of magnitude as the incident wave amplitude. A\nperturbation expansion of the velocity potential and free-surface boundary\ncondition is invoked and solved to third-order in terms of $ka$ and $kA$. The\nvalidity of this approach is investigated through a comparison with canonical\nsecond-order diffraction theory and existing experimental results. We find that\nfor small $ka$, the long wavelength theory is valid up to $kA \\approx 0.16-0.2$\non the up wave side of the cylinder. However, this domain is significantly\nreduced to $kA<0.06$ when an arbitrary position around the cylinder is\nconsidered.

This problem is\nespecially challenging when large deformations occur. In this paper, we present\na novel algorithm to obtain diffeomorphic image or surface registrations with\nlarge deformations via quasi-conformal maps. The basic idea is to minimize an\nenergy functional involving a Beltrami coefficient term, which measures the\ndistortion of the quasi-conformal map. The Beltrami coefficient effectively\ncontrols the bijectivity and smoothness of the registration, even with very\nlarge deformations. Using the proposed algorithm, landmark-based registration\nbetween images or surfaces can be effectively computed. The obtained\nregistration is guaranteed to be diffeomorphic (1-1 and onto), even with a\nlarge deformation or large number of landmark constraints. The proposed\nalgorithm can also be combined with matching intensity (such as image intensity\nor surface curvature) to improve the accuracy of the registration.

This dynamically generated\ndarkness is particularly pronounced slightly above the transition to a\nsuperradiant phase. We attribute the effect to a slowing down of the motion in\nthe classical limit of a large ensemble and to an interplay of dynamic and\ngeometric phases in the quantum case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Oct 2013 10:00:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-13"}

For such models, the estimation of parameter sensitivities is an\nimportant and challenging problem. Sensitivity values help in analyzing the\nnetwork, understanding its robustness properties and also in identifying the\nkey reactions for a given outcome. Most of the methods that exist in the\nliterature for the estimation of parameter sensitivities, rely on Monte Carlo\nsimulations using Gillespie's stochastic simulation algorithm or its variants.\nIt is well-known that such simulation methods can be prohibitively expensive\nwhen the network contains reactions firing at different time-scales, which is a\nfeature of many important biochemical networks. For such networks, it is often\npossible to exploit the time-scale separation and approximately capture the\noriginal dynamics by simulating a \"reduced\" model, which is obtained by\neliminating the fast reactions in a certain way. The aim of this paper is to\ntie these model reduction techniques with sensitivity analysis. We prove that\nunder some conditions, the sensitivity values of the reduced model can be used\nto approximately recover the sensitivity values for the original model. Through\nan example we illustrate how our result can help in sharply reducing the\ncomputational costs for the estimation of parameter sensitivities for reaction\nnetworks with multiple time-scales. To prove our result, we use coupling\narguments based on the random time change representation of Kurtz. We also\nexploit certain connections between the distributions of the occupation times\nof Markov chains and multi-dimensional wave equations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Oct 2013 10:58:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-08"}

The additional geometric constraint present in the column setup\nfrustrates the convection state that is normally observed in wider geometries.\nThis makes it possible to study collective oscillations of the grains with a\ncharacteristic frequency that is much lower than the frequency of energy\ninjection.

This first principles model requires a single input parameter, i.e, the\ncentre of mass of the system. The model shows that a sufficient condition for\nthe existence of the low-frequency mode is an inverted density profile with\ndistinct low and high density regions, a condition that may apply to other\nsystems too. The second, simpler model just assumes an harmonic oscillator like\nbehaviour and, using thermodynamic arguments, is also able to reproduce the\nobserved frequencies with high accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Oct 2013 13:23:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

In the external\nfield problem of QED, we encounter this problem in the form that the Dirac time\nevolution for an external field with non-vanishing magnetic components will not\nsatisfy the Shale-Stinespring condition, known to be necessary and sufficient\nfor the existence of an implementation on the fermionic Fock space. Therefore,\na second quantization of the time evolution in the usual way is impossible. In\nthis thesis, we present several rigorous approaches to QED with time-dependent,\nexternal fields and analyze in what sense a time evolution can exist in the\nsecond quantized theory. We study different constructions of the fermionic Fock\nspace and prove their equivalence. We study and compare the results of Deckert\net. al.

We provide rigorous proof for the fact that\nthe second quantization by parallel transport preserves causality. These\nfindings seem to refute claims made in Scharf (1995) that the phase of the\nsecond quantized S-matrix is essentially determined by the requirement of\ncausality. We propose a simple solution to the problem of gauge anomalies in\nthe procedure of Langmann and Mickelsson, showing that the second quantization\nof the scattering operator can be made gauge-invariant by using a suitable\nclass of renormalizations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Oct 2013 13:31:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-08"}

However, most precoding schemes\nexhibit high computational complexity as the system dimensions increase. For\nexample, the near-optimal RZF requires the inversion of a large matrix.

In particular, a noncooperative game is\nformulated between storage units, such as PHEVs, or an array of batteries that\nare trading their stored energy. Here, each storage unit's owner can decide on\nthe maximum amount of energy to sell in a local market so as to maximize a\nutility that reflects the tradeoff between the revenues from energy trading and\nthe accompanying costs.

The Maslov index measures the signed\nintersections (with a given reference plane) of a path of Lagrangian planes.\nThe natural chart parameterization for the Grassmannian of Lagrangian planes is\nthe space of real symmetric matrices. Linear system evolution induces a Riccati\nevolution in the chart. For large order systems this is a practical approach as\nthe computational complexity is quadratic in the order. The Riccati solutions,\nhowever, also exhibit singularites (which are traversed by changing charts).\nOur new results involve characterizing these Riccati singularities and two\ntrace formulae for the Maslov index as follows. First, we show that the number\nof singular eigenvalues of the symmetric chart representation equals the\ndimension of intersection with the reference plane. Second, the Cayley map is a\ndiffeomorphism from the space of real symmetric matrices to the manifold of\nunitary symmetric matrices. We show the logarithm of the Cayley map equals the\narctan map (modulo 2i) and its trace measures the angle of the Langrangian\nplane to the reference plane. Third, the Riccati flow under the Cayley map\ninduces a flow in the manifold of unitary symmetric matrices. Using the natural\nunitary action on this manifold, we pullback the flow to the unitary Lie\nalgebra and monitor its trace. This avoids singularities, and is a natural\nrobust procedure. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these approaches by\napplying them to a large eigenvalue problem.

In SSS,\ndepending on the sensing decisions, they adapt the transmission power level and\ncoexist with primary users in the channel. On the other hand, in OSA, secondary\nusers are allowed to transmit only when the primary user activity is not\ndetected. Initially, for both transmission schemes, general formulations for\nthe optimal decision rule and error probabilities are provided for arbitrary\nmodulation schemes under the assumptions that the receiver is equipped with the\nsensing decision and perfect knowledge of the channel fading, and the primary\nuser's received faded signals at the secondary receiver has a Gaussian mixture\ndistribution.

Using coherent systems, we express every non-simple\nLazarsfeld-Mukai bundle on S as an extension of two sheaves of some special\ntype, that we refer to as generalized Lazarsfeld-Mukai bundles. This has\ninteresting consequences concerning the Brill-Noether theory of curves C lying\non S. From now on, let g denote the genus of C and A be a complete linear\nseries of type g^r_d on C such that d<= g-1 and the corresponding Brill-Noether\nnumber is negative. First, we focus on the cases where A computes the Clifford\nindex; if r>1 and with only some completely classified exceptions, we show that\nA coincides with the restriction to C of a line bundle on S. This is a\nrefinement of Green and Lazarsfeld's result on the constancy of the Clifford\nindex of curves moving in the same linear system. Then, we study a conjecture\nof Donagi and Morrison predicting that, under no hypothesis on its Clifford\nindex, A is contained in a g^s_e which is cut out from a line bundle on S and\nsatisfies e<= g-1. We provide counterexamples to the last inequality already\nfor r=2. A slight modification of the conjecture, which holds for r=1,2, is\nproved under some hypotheses on the pair (C,A) and its deformations. We show\nthat the result is optimal (in the sense that our hypotheses cannot be avoided)\nby exhibiting, in the Appendix, some counterexamples obtained jointly with\nAndreas Leopold Knutsen.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Oct 2013 15:52:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Oct 2014 08:18:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-17"}

An\nimplicit, orbit-averaged time-space-centered finite difference scheme is\napplied to both the 1D Darwin field equations (in potential form) and the 1D-3V\nparticle orbit equations to produce a discrete system that remains exactly\ncharge- and energy-conserving.

We show how node mobility can provide\ndiversity by changing the topology of the network. More specifically, we\nconsider a mobile network of a sensor node and a number of sink nodes which are\nall moving randomly according to different Wiener process mobility models.\nAssuming that the network topology evolves with time and assuming that the\nconnectivity of the sensor node to at least one sink node is needed for\nsuccessful communication, we calculate three performance measures for this\nnetwork, i) the expected number of time instants, where the sensor node is\nconnected to at least one sink node, ii) the probability of outage, being the\nprobability that no sink node is in the vicinity of the sensor node during the\nobservation interval, and finally, iii) the maximum number of consequent\nfailures in the communication. Our theoretical and numerical analysis show that\nincreasing the mobility parameter of the sensor node increases the average\nnumber of successful transmissions, decreases the probability of outage, and\nreduces the maximum delay in the senor-sink communication.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Oct 2013 15:54:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-08"}
