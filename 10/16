These fields in turn break $G$ to two\ndifferent subgroups $H_{1}$ and $H_{2}$ on each domain wall, and the gauge\nfields of these subgroups are taken to be localized to the respective walls by\nthe confinement dynamics of $G$. There is then a further breaking on the\ndomain-wall intersection to $H_{1}\\cap{}H_{2}$ and gauge fields of this overlap\ngroup can then be localized to the intersection if they belong inside\nnon-Abelian subgroups of both $H_{1}$ and $H_{2}$ which are spontaneously\nbroken on the intersection and confining in the 4+1D bulks of the respective\ndomain-wall branes.

In our model, search providers\ncompete for customers by strategically selecting which search results to\ndisplay in response to user queries. Customers, in turn, have private\npreferences over search results and will tend to use search engines that are\nmore likely to display pages satisfying their demands.\n  Our main question is whether competition between search engines increases the\noverall welfare of the users (i.e., the likelihood that a user finds a page of\ninterest). When search engines derive utility only from customers to whom they\nshow relevant results, we show that they differentiate their results, and every\nequilibrium of the resulting game achieves at least half of the welfare that\ncould be obtained by a social planner. This bound also applies whenever the\nlikelihood of selecting a given engine is a convex function of the probability\nthat a user's demand will be satisfied, which includes natural Markovian models\nof user behavior.\n  On the other hand, when search engines derive utility from all customers\n(independent of search result relevance) and the customer demand functions are\nnot convex, there are instances in which the (unique) equilibrium involves no\ndifferentiation between engines and a high degree of randomness in search\nresults. This can degrade social welfare by a factor of the square root of N\nrelative to the social optimum, where N is the number of webpages. These bad\nequilibria persist even when search engines can extract only small (but\nnon-zero) expected revenue from dissatisfied users, and much higher revenue\nfrom satisfied ones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Oct 2013 16:07:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-16"}

The study of abundances of Mn-over-Fe as a function of metallicity\nin the Galactic bulge may shed light on its production mechanisms.\nHigh-resolution spectra were obtained using the FLAMES+UVES spectrograph on the\nVery Large Telescope. The spectra were obtained within a program to observe 800\nstars using the GIRAFFE spectrograph, together with the present UVES spectra.\nWe aim at identifying the chemical evolution of manganese, as a function of\nmetallicity, in the Galactic bulge. We find [Mn/Fe] ~-0.7 at [Fe/H]~-1.3,\nincreasing to a solar value at metallicities close to solar, and showing a\nspread around -0.7<[Fe/H]<-0.2, in good agreement with other work on Mn in\nbulge stars. There is also good agreement with chemical evolution models. We\nfind no clear difference in the behaviour of the four bulge fields. Whereas\n[Mn/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] could be identified with the behaviour of the thick disc\nstars, [Mn/O] vs. [O/H] has a behaviour running parallel, at higher\nmetallicities, compared to thick disc stars, indicating that the bulge\nenrichment might have proceeded differently from that of the thick disk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Oct 2013 16:39:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

X-rays trace emission from AGN unambiguously,\nwhile powerful star-forming galaxies are usually dust-obscured and are\nbrightest at infrared to submillimetre wavelengths. Here we report observations\nin the submillimetre and X-ray which show that rapid star formation was common\nin the host galaxies of AGN when the Universe was 2-6 Gyrs old, but that the\nmost vigorous star formation is not observed around black holes above an X-ray\nluminosity of 10^44 erg/s.

It is not due to the decrease in stellar radiation field or\ntemperature in a simple way because the FIR-bright regions in the outer disk\nalso have a low beta.

Our Local Group of galaxies appears to be moving relative to the\ncosmic microwave background with the source of the peculiar motion still\nuncertain.

We measured the bulk flow in the nearby universe ($0.015 < z < 0.1$)\nusing 117 SNe Ia observed by the Nearby Supernova Factory, as well as the\nUnion2 compilation of SN Ia data already in the literature.\n  Methods. The bulk flow velocity was determined from SN data binned in\nredshift shells by including a coherent motion (dipole) in a cosmological fit.\nAdditionally, a method of spatially smoothing the Hubble residuals was used to\nverify the results of the dipole fit. To constrain the location and mass of a\npotential mass concentration (e.g., the Shapley supercluster) responsible for\nthe peculiar motion, we fit a Hubble law modified by adding an additional mass\nconcentration.\n  Results. The analysis shows a bulk flow that is consistent with the direction\nof the CMB dipole up to $z \\sim 0.06$, thereby doubling the volume over which\nconventional distance measures are sensitive to a bulk flow.

Once the sensor locations have been identified from the training data,\nsubsequent test samples are classified with remarkable efficiency, achieving\nperformance comparable to that obtained by discrimination using the full image.\nSensor locations may be learned from full images, or from a random subsample of\npixels. For classification between more than two categories, we introduce a\ncoupling parameter whose value tunes the number of sensors selected, trading\naccuracy for economy.

To date such a distinction is not possible\nwith established approaches. Thus, there is a critical need for a theoretical\napproach that distinguishes the effects of changes in sensitivity from those of\nchanges in choice bias in multialternative tasks.

Further, with each CMOS\ntechnology generation, leakage energy has been dramatically increasing and\nhence, leakage energy is expected to become a major source of energy\ndissipation, especially in last-level caches (LLCs). The conventional schemes\nof cache energy saving either aim at saving dynamic energy or are based on\nproperties specific to first-level caches, and thus these schemes have limited\nutility for last-level caches.

In this\npaper, we characterize i) the initiation process in which the number of arms in\nthe starburst is controlled by the ratio of surface tension contrast to the\ngel's elastic modulus and ii) the propagation dynamics showing that once\nfractures are initiated they propagate with a universal power law $L\\propto\nt^{3/4}$. We develop a model for crack initiation by treating the gel as a\nlinear elastic solid and computing the deformations within the substrate from\nthe liquid/solid wetting forces. The elastic solution shows that both the\nlocation and magnitude of the wetting forces are critical in providing a\nquantitative prediction for the number of fractures and, hence, an\ninterpretation of the initiation of capillary fractures. This solution also\nreveals that the depth of the gel is an important factor in the fracture\nprocess, as it can help mitigate large surface tractions; this finding is\nconfirmed with experiments. We then develop a model for crack propagation by\nconsidering the transport of an inviscid fluid into the fracture tip of an\nincompressible material, and find that a simple energy-conservation argument\ncan explain the observed material-independent power law.

The ejecta was\noverabundant in heavy elements, such as Mg, Si, S, Ca, Fe, and Ni. The\nunprecedentedly high quality of data obtained by XIS, allowed us to correctly\ndistinguish between the emissions from the ISM and the ejecta for the first\ntime. Combining XIS spectral analysis with Chandra/ACIS image analysis, we\nverified that the ejecta distributions for elements from Si to Fe-K were\nsimilar to one another, although Fe-K emission was located slightly inward\ncompared with that of lighter elements such as Si, S, Ar, and Ca. The\nonion-like structure of the ejecta was maintained after the SN. In addition,\nthe ISM emission represented by O and Fe-L was located inside the ejecta\nemission.

Constrained transport can be viewed as a sort of predictor-corrector\nmethod for updating the magnetic field, where a magnetic field value is first\npredicted by a method that does not preserve the divergence-free condition on\nthe magnetic field, followed by a correction step that aims to control these\ndivergence errors. This strategy has been successfully used in conjunction with\na variety of shock-capturing methods including WENO, central, and wave\npropagation schemes. In this work we show how to extend the basic CT framework\nto the discontinuous Galerkin finite element method on both 2D and 3D Cartesian\ngrids. We first review the entropy-stability theory for semi-discrete DG\ndiscretizations of ideal MHD, which rigorously establishes the need for a\nmagnetic field that satisfies the following conditions: (1) the divergence of\nthe magnetic field is zero on each element, and (2) the normal components of\nthe magnetic field are continuous across element edges/faces. In order to\nachieve such a globally divergence-free magnetic field, we introduce a novel CT\nscheme that is based on two ingredients: (1) we introduce an element-centered\nmagnetic vector potential that is updated via a discontinuous Galerkin scheme\non the induction equation; and (2) we define a mapping that takes\nelement-centered magnetic field values and element-centered magnetic vector\npotential values and creates on each edge /face a representation of the normal\ncomponent of the magnetic field; this representation is then mapped back to the\nelements to create a globally divergence-free element-centered representation\nof the magnetic field.

Combining multiple models\nor data sources helps to counteract the effects of low data quality and the\nbias of any single model or data source, and thus can improve the robustness\nand the performance of predictive models. Out of privacy, storage and bandwidth\nconsiderations, in certain circumstances one has to combine the predictions\nfrom multiple models or data sources to obtain the final predictions without\naccessing the raw data. Consensus-based prediction combination algorithms are\neffective for such situations. However, current research on prediction\ncombination focuses on the single label setting, where an instance can have one\nand only one label. Nonetheless, data nowadays are usually multilabeled, such\nthat more than one label have to be predicted at the same time. Direct\napplications of existing prediction combination methods to multilabel settings\ncan lead to degenerated performance. In this paper, we address the challenges\nof combining predictions from multiple multilabel classifiers and propose two\nnovel algorithms, MLCM-r (MultiLabel Consensus Maximization for ranking) and\nMLCM-a (MLCM for microAUC). These algorithms can capture label correlations\nthat are common in multilabel classifications, and optimize corresponding\nperformance metrics.

However, state-of-the-art techniques for rendering noise maps in\nurban areas are expensive and rarely updated, as they rely on population and\ntraffic models rather than on real data. Smart phone based urban sensing can be\nleveraged to create an open and inexpensive platform for rendering up-to- date\nnoise maps. In this paper, we present the design, implementation and\nperformance evaluation of an end-to-end, context-aware, noise mapping system\ncalled Ear-Phone. Ear-Phone investigates the use of different interpolation and\nregularization methods to address the fundamental problem of recovering the\nnoise map from incomplete and random samples obtained by crowdsourcing data\ncollection. Ear-Phone, implemented on Nokia N95, N97 and HP iPAQ, HTC One\nmobile devices, also addresses the challenge of collecting accurate noise\npollution readings at a mobile device. A major challenge of using smart phones\nas sensors is that even at the same location, the sensor reading may vary\ndepending on the phone orientation and user context (for example, whether the\nuser is carrying the phone in a bag or holding it in her palm). To address this\nproblem, Ear-Phone leverages context-aware sensing. We develop classifiers to\naccurately determine the phone sensing context. Upon context discovery,\nEar-Phone automatically decides whether to sense or not. Ear-phone also\nimplements in-situ calibration which performs simple calibration that can be\ncarried out without any technical skills whatsoever required on the user's\npart. Extensive simulations and outdoor experiments demonstrate that Ear-Phone\nis a feasible platform to assess noise pollution, incurring reasonable system\nresource consumption at mobile devices and providing high reconstruction\naccuracy of the noise map.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Oct 2013 05:04:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-17"}

Since particles\nvelocities are generally close to c, the speed of light, and detectors typical\ndimensions at the meter level, the state-of-the-art tof techniques should reach\nsub-nanosecond timing resolution. Among the various techniques already\navailable, the recently developed ring oscillator TDC ones, implemented in low\ncost FPGA, feature a very interesting figure of merit since a very good timing\nperformance may be achieved with limited processing ressources.

Actually this article describes in details the\napplication of this kind of tof technique to muon tomography of geological\nbodies. Muon tomography aims at measuring density variations and absolute\ndensities through the detection of atmospheric muons flux's attenuation, due to\nthe presence of matter. When the measured fluxes become very low, an identified\nsource of noise comes from backwards propagating particles hitting the detector\nin a direction pointing to the geological body.

In addition,\nhigher order Aitken extrapolation is introduced that enables successive\ndecomposition of high Eigen values of the iteration matrix to enable\nconvergence. While extrapolation of a convergent fixed point iteration using a\ngeometric series sum is a known form of Aitken acceleration, it is shown in\nthis paper that the same formula can be used to estimate the solution of sets\nof linear equations from diverging Gauss Seidel iterations. In both convergent\nand divergent iterations, the ratios of differences among the consecutive\nvalues of iteration eventually form a convergent or divergent series with a\nfactor equal to the largest Eigen value of the iteration matrix.

Whereas optimal\nalgorithms for finding common intervals in permutations exist even for an\narbitrary number of permutations, in sequences no optimal algorithm has been\nproposed yet even for only two sequences. Surprisingly enough, when sequences\nare reduced to permutations, the existing algorithms perform far from the\noptimum, showing that their performances are not dependent, as they should be,\non the structural complexity of the input sequences.\n  In this paper, we propose to characterize the structure of a sequence by the\nnumber $q$ of different dominating orders composing it (called the domination\nnumber), and to use a recent algorithm for permutations in order to devise a\nnew algorithm for two sequences. Its running time is in\n$O(q_1q_2p+q_1n_1+q_2n_2+N)$, where $n_1, n_2$ are the sizes of the two\nsequences, $q_1,q_2$ are their respective domination numbers, $p$ is the\nalphabet size and $N$ is the number of solutions to output. This algorithm\nperforms better as $q_1$ and/or $q_2$ reduce, and when the two sequences are\nreduced to permutations (i.e. when $q_1=q_2=1$) it has the same running time as\nthe best algorithms for permutations. It is also the first algorithm for\nsequences whose running time involves the parameter size of the solution. As a\ncounterpart, when $q_1$ and $q_2$ are of $O(n_1)$ and $O(n_2)$ respectively,\nthe algorithm is less efficient than other approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Oct 2013 07:58:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-17"}

The key\nadvantages, overlays offer, are flexibility, adaptability and ease of\ndeployment [1]. The general approach to build an application layer multicast\narchitecture involves tracking network characteristics and building appropriate\ntopologies by allowing the end users to self organize into logical overlay\nnetworks for efficient data delivery.

In this\ncontribution, we focus on these so-called entrance effects and specifically\nexamine whether the characteristic hourglass shape of aquaporins may arise from\na geometrical optimum for such hydrodynamic dissipation. Using a combination of\nfinite-element calculations and analytical modeling, we show that conical\nentrances with suitable opening angle can indeed provide a large increase of\nthe overall channel permeability. Moreover, the optimal opening angles that\nmaximize the permeability are found to compare well with the angles measured in\na large variety of aquaporins. This suggests that the hourglass shape of\naquaporins could be the result of a natural selection process toward optimal\nhydrodynamic transport. Finally, in a biomimetic perspective, these results\nprovide guidelines to design artificial nanopores with optimal performances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Oct 2013 09:50:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-17"}

Especially, it is important\nto study the influence of the velocity of the impacting projectiles. We also\nwant to provide models for dust growth in protoplanetary disks with simple\nrecipes to account for erosion effects.\n  Methods: To study the erosion of dust aggregates we employed a molecular\ndynamics approach that features a detailed micro-physical model of the\ninteraction of spherical grains. For the first time, the model has been\nextended by introducing a new visco-elastic damping force which requires a\nproper calibration. Afterwards, different sample generation methods were used\nto cover a wide range of aggregate types.\n  Results: The visco-elastic damping force introduced in this work turns out to\nbe crucial to reproduce results obtained from laboratory experiments. After\nproper calibration, we find that erosion occurs for impact velocities of 5 m/s\nand above. Though fractal aggregates as formed during the first growth phase\nare most susceptible to erosion, we observe erosion of aggregates with rather\ncompact surfaces as well.\n  Conclusions: We find that bombarding a larger target aggregate with small\nprojectiles results in erosion for impact velocities as low as a few m/s. More\ncompact aggregates suffer less from erosion. With increasing projectile size\nthe transition from accretion to erosion is shifted to higher velocities. This\nallows larger bodies to grow through high velocity collisions with smaller\naggregates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Oct 2013 09:54:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

A generalization of this approach consists in\nreplacing the density operators of the standard formulation with suitable\nfunctions, the so-called generalized Wigner functions or (group-covariant)\ntomograms, obtained by means of group-theoretical methods. A typical problem\narising in this context is to express the evolution of a quantum system in\nterms of tomograms. In the case of a (suitable) open quantum system, the\ndynamics can be described by means of a quantum dynamical semigroup 'in\ndisguise', namely, by a semigroup of operators acting on tomograms rather than\non density operators. We focus on a special class of quantum dynamical\nsemigroups, the twirling semigroups, that have interesting applications, e.g.,\nin quantum information science. The 'disguised counterparts' of the twirling\nsemigroups, i.e., the corresponding semigroups acting on tomograms, form a\nclass of semigroups of operators that we call tomographic semigroups.

They may have been caused by the passage of the density\nwave or simply created by other means near the arms. The study of these regions\nmay give us clues to clarifying the controversy over the existence of a\ntriggering scenario, as proposed in the density wave theory. Using H$\\alpha$\ndirect imaging, we characterize the HII regions from a sample of three grand\ndesign galaxies: NGC5457, NGC628 and NGC6946. Broad band images in R and I were\nused to determine the position of the arms. The HII regions found to be\nassociated with arms were selected for the study. The age and the star\nformation rate of these HII regions was obtained using measures on the\nH$\\alpha$ line. The distance between the current position of the selected HII\nregions and the position they would have if they had been created in the centre\nof the arm is calculated. A parameter, T, which measures whether a region was\ncreated in the arm or in the disc, is defined. With the help of the T parameter\nwe determine that the majority of regions were formed some time after the\npassage of the density wave, with the regions located `behind the arm' (in the\ndirection of the rotation of the galaxy) the zone they should have occupied had\nthey been formed in the centre of the arm. The presence of the large number of\nregions created after the passage of the arm may be explained by the effect of\nthe density wave, which helps to create the star-forming regions after its\npassage. There is clear evidence of triggering for NGC5457 and a co-rotation\nradius is proposed. A more modest triggering seems to exist for NGC628 and non\nsignificant evidence of triggering are found for NGC6946.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Oct 2013 10:45:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

Appreciable\ndifferences emerge between the physical properties of the two models.\nSpecifically, the $k \\to 0$ behavior of SW-SW structure factors $S(k)$ points\nto the presence of a gas-liquid coexistence, as confirmed by subsequent fluid\nphase equilibria calculations. Conversely, the HS-SW $S(k)$ develops a low-$k$\npeak, signaling the presence of aggregates; such a process destabilizes the\ngas-liquid phase separation, promoting at low temperatures the formation of a\ncluster phase, whose structure depends on the system density. We further\ninvestigate such differences by studying the phase behavior of a series of\nintermediate models, obtained from the original SW-SW by progressively reducing\nthe depth of one square-well interaction. RISM structural predictions\npositively reproduce the simulation data, including the rise of $S(k \\to 0$) in\nthe SW-SW model and the low-$k$ peak in the HS-SW structure factor. As for the\nphase behavior, RISM agrees with Monte Carlo simulations in predicting a\ngas-liquid coexistence for the SW-SW model (though the critical parameters\nappears overestimated by the theory) and its progressive disappearance moving\ntoward the HS-SW model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Oct 2013 10:47:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-13"}

Using the Dynamic Mean Field\nTheory (DMFT) formalism on the Bethe lattice we find rigorously the temperature\ndependent Density of States ($DOS$) at half filling in the limit of high\ndimensions. At zero temperature (T=0) the system is ordered to form the\ncheckerboard pattern and the $DOS$ has the gap $\\Delta$ at the Fermi level\n$\\varepsilon_F=0$, which is proportional to the interaction constant $U$. With\nan increase of $T$ the $DOS$ evolves in various ways that depend on $U$. For\n$U>U_{cr}$ the gap persists for any $T$ (then $\\Delta >0$), so the system is\nalways an insulator. However, if $U < U_{cr}$, two additional subbands develop\ninside the gap. They become wider with increasing $T$ and at a certain\n$U$-dependent temperature $T_{MI}$ they join with each other at\n$\\varepsilon_F$. Since above $T_{MI}$ the $DOS$ is positive at $\\varepsilon_F$,\nwe interpret $T_{MI}$ as the transformation temperature from insulator to\nmetal. It appears, that $T_{MI}$ approaches the order-disorder phase transition\ntemperature $T_{O-DO}$ when $U$ is close to 0 or $ U_{cr}$, but $T_{MI}$ is\nsubstantially lower than $T_{O-DO}$ for intermediate values of $U$.

Then we find how the order\nparameter $d$ and the gap $\\Delta $ change with $T$ and we construct the phase\ndiagram in the variables $T$ and $U$, where we display regions of stability of\nfour different phases: ordered insulator, ordered metal, disordered insulator\nand disordered metal. Finally, we use a low temperature expansion to\ndemonstrate the existence of a nonzero DOS at a characteristic value of U on a\ngeneral bipartite lattice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Oct 2013 11:25:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

In this communication we use a supercell-based approach to obtain the\nelastic properties of random solid solution cubic ZrAlN system as a function of\nthe metallic sublattice composition and texture descriptors. The employed\nspecial quasi-random structures are optimised not only with respect to short\nrange order parameters, but also to make the three cubic directions\n$[1\\,0\\,0]$, $[0\\,1\\,0]$, and $[0\\,0\\,1]$ as similar as possible. In this way,\nonly a small spread of elastic constants tensor components is achieved and an\noptimum trade-off between modelling of chemical disorder and computational\nlimits regarding the supercell size is achieved. The single crystal elastic\nconstants are shown to vary smoothly with composition, yielding\n$x\\approx0.4$-0.5 an alloy constitution with an almost isotropic response.\nConsequently, polycrystals with this composition are suggested to have Young's\nmodulus independent on the actual microstructure. This is indeed confirmed by\nexplicit calculations of polycrystal elastic properties, both within the\nisotropic aggregate limit, as well as with fibre textures with various\norientations and sharpness. It turns out, that for low AlN mole fractions, the\nspread of the possible Young's moduli data caused by the texture variation can\nbe larger than 100 GPa. Consequently, our discussion of Young's modulus data of\ncubic ZrAlN contains also the evaluation of the texture typical for thin films.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Oct 2013 12:17:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Jul 2014 14:40:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-24"}

Because\nof the non-normality of the population, the true p-values of the hypothesis\ntests are typically unknown. Hence, it is common to use the standard normal\ndistribution N(0,1), Student's $t$ distribution $t_{n-1}$ or the bootstrap\nmethod to estimate the p-values. In this paper, we first study N(0,1) and\n$t_{n-1}$ calibrations. We prove that, when the population has the finite 4-th\nmoment and the dimension $m$ and the sample size $n$ satisfy $\\log\nm=o(n^{1/3})$, B-H method controls the false discovery rate (FDR) at a given\nlevel $\\alpha$ asymptotically with p-values estimated from N(0,1) or $t_{n-1}$\ndistribution. However, a phase transition phenomenon occurs when $\\log m\\geq\nc_{0}n^{1/3}$. In this case, the FDR of B-H method may be larger than $\\alpha$\nor even tends to one. In contrast, the bootstrap calibration is accurate for\n$\\log m=o(n^{1/2})$ as long as the underlying distribution has the sub-Gaussian\ntails. However, such light tailed condition can not be weakened in general. The\nsimulation study shows that for the heavy tailed distributions, the bootstrap\ncalibration is very conservative. In order to solve this problem, a regularized\nbootstrap correction is proposed and is shown to be robust to the tails of the\ndistributions. The simulation study shows that the regularized bootstrap method\nperforms better than the usual bootstrap method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Oct 2013 13:37:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-17"}

We present the first\nspectropolarimetric observations of the S-type Mira star chi Cyg, performed\naround its maximum light. We have detected a polarimetric signal in the Stokes\nV spectra and we have established its Zeeman origin. We claim that it is likely\nto be related to a weak magnetic field present at the photospheric level and in\nthe lower part of the stellar atmosphere. We have estimated the strength of its\nlongitudinal component to about 2-3 Gauss. This result favors a 1/r law for the\nvariation of the magnetic field strength across the circumstellar envelope of\nchi Cyg. This is the first detection of a weak magnetic field at the stellar\nsurface of a Mira star and we discuss its origin in the framework of shock\nwaves periodically propagating throughout the atmosphere of these radially\npulsating stars. At the date of our observations of chi Cyg, the shock wave\nreaches its maximum intensity, and it is likely that the shock amplifies a weak\nstellar magnetic field during its passage through the atmosphere. Without such\nan amplification by the shock, the magnetic field strength would have been too\nlow to be detected. For the first time, we also report strong Stokes Q and U\nsignatures (linear polarization) centered onto the zero velocity (i.e., at the\nshock front position). They seem to indicate that the radial direction would be\nfavored by the shock during its propagation throughout the atmosphere.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Oct 2013 13:57:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 Nov 2013 16:36:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 6 Dec 2013 13:09:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

These cavities could\npossibly be created by the presence of one or more massive planets. If the gap\nis created by planets and gas is still present in it, then there should be a\nflow of gas past the planet into the inner region. It is our goal to study the\nmass accretion rate into the gap and in particular the dependency on the\nplanet's mass and the thermodynamic properties of the disk. We performed 2D\nhydro simulations for disks with embedded planets. We added radiative cooling\nfrom the disk surfaces, radiative diffusion in the disk midplane, and stellar\nirradiation to the energy equation to have more realistic models. The mass flow\nrate into the gap region depends, for given disk thermodynamics,\nnon-monotonically on the mass of the planet. Generally, more massive planets\nopen wider and deeper gaps which would tend to reduce the mass accretion into\nthe inner cavity. However, for larger mass planets the outer disk becomes\neccentric and the mass flow rate is enhanced over the low mass cases. As a\nresult, for the isothermal disks the mass flow is always comparable to the\nexpected mass flow of unperturbed disks M_d, while for more realistic radiative\ndisks the mass flow is very small for low mass planets (<= 4 M_jup) and about\n50% for larger planet masses. For the radiative disks that critical planet mass\nfor the disk to become eccentric is much larger that in the isothermal case.\nMassive embedded planets can reduce the mass flow across the gap considerably,\nto values of about an order of magnitude smaller than the standard disk\naccretion rate, and can be responsible for opening large cavities. The\nremaining mass flow into the central cavity is in good agreement with the\nobservations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Oct 2013 14:24:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 2 Dec 2013 09:40:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-03"}

We give a $(1 - 1/e)/(k_{in} +\nk_{out}+1)$-approximation algorithm for the case in which we are given $k_{in}$\nmatroids as inner constraints and $k_{out}$ matroids as outer constraints.\nAdditionally, we obtain an improved $1/(k_{in} + k_{out})$-approximation\nalgorithm for linear objective functions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Oct 2013 15:24:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Oct 2013 16:01:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 17 Feb 2014 16:04:52 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 18 Feb 2014 12:18:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-19"}

This intrinsically blue transient rose slowly to\nreach a peak magnitude of M_u = -21.4 mag and bolometric luminosity of 8 x\n10^43 ergs^-1 before settling onto a relatively shallow gradient of decline.\nThe observed decline is significantly slower than those of the superluminous\ntype Ic SNe which have been the focus of much recent attention. Spectroscopic\nsimilarities with the lower redshift SN2007bi and a decline rate similar to\n56Co decay timescale initially indicated that this transient could be a\ncandidate for a pair instability supernova (PISN) explosion. Overall the\ntransient appears quite similar to SN2007bi and the lower redshift object\nPTF12dam. The extensive data set, from 30 days before peak to 230 days after,\nallows a detailed and quantitative comparison with published models of PISN\nexplosions.

We find that in the limit of\nlarge flakes containing zigzag edges the dot-localized energy levels appear\nwithin the energy continuum formed by extended states. As a consequence no\nionization threshold for the carriers contained within the dot exists. For\nsmaller flakes with zigzag boundaries the dot-localized energy levels appear\ninterlaced with the energy levels outside the flake, so in a charging\nexperiment the electrons will be added alternately to the dot area and to its\nneighborhood. We demonstrate that for flakes with armchair boundaries only, an\nenergy window accessible uniquely to the dot-localized states is opened. Then a\nnumber of electrons can be added to the dot before the external states start to\nbe occupied. We also discuss coupling of the dot-localized states to the edge\nstates in the context of the valley degeneracy lifting. Moreover, we extract\nsmooth envelope wave functions from the tight-binding solution and discuss\ntheir spatial symmetries. The coupling of the dot localized energy levels with\nreconstructed zigzag edges and atomic vacancies present within the layers is\nalso considered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Oct 2013 07:48:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-21"}

Indeed a careful reading of them proves that\nthey are original, deep and far reaching. Actually -even if his contribution to\nmechanical sciences is not completely ignored- one can undoubtedly say that the\ngreatest part of his novel contributions to mechanics, although having provided\na great impetus and substantial influence on the work of many preminent\nmechanicians, is in fact generally ignored. It has to be remarked that authors\n[10] dedicated many efforts to the aim of unveiling the true value of Gabrio\nPiola as a scientist; however, some deep parts of his scientific results remain\nnot yet sufficiently illustrated. Our aim is to prove that non-local and higher\ngradient continuum mechanics was conceived already in Piola's works and to try\nto explain the reasons of the unfortunate circumstance which caused the erasure\nof the memory of this aspect of Piola's contribution. Some relevant\ndifferential relationships obtained in Piola [Piola, 1845-6] are carefully\ndiscussed, as they are still nowadays too often ignored in the continuum\nmechanics literature and can be considered the starting point of Levi-Civita's\ntheory of Connection for Riemannian manifolds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Oct 2013 08:06:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-22"}
