A way of testing the\nusefulness of a known uncertainty principle inequality is proposed for a whole\nclass of model two-electron atoms with harmonic confinement but variable\nelectron-electron interaction. Emerging properties are then studied by\nreference to bcc Na at ambient pressure and its modeling by `jellium'. Jellium\nitself has collective behaviour with changes of the density, especially\nnoteworthy being the discontinuity of the momentum distribution at the Fermi\nsurface. This has almost reduced to zero at $r_s = 100$ a.u., the neighbourhood\nin which the quantal Wigner electron solid transition is known to occur.\nHowever, various workers have studied crystalline Na under pressure and their\nresults are compared and contrasted. Work by DFT on K, Rb, and Cs is discussed,\nbut now with reduced density from the ambient pressure value. The crystalline\nresults for the cohesive energy of these metals as a function of lattice\nparameters and local coordination number are shown to be closely reproduced by\nmeans of ground and excited states for dimer potential energy curves. Then,\npair potentials for liquid Na and Be are reviewed, and compared with the\nresults of computer simulations from the experimental structure factor for Na.\nFinally, magnetic field effects are discussed. First a phenomenological model\nof the metal-to-insulator transition is presented with an order parameter which\nis the discontinuity in the Fermi momentum distribution.

However, the notion that using of distance\nfunctions in conventional interaction models effectively captures spatial\ndependence in international flows has long been challenged. It has been\nrecently fully recognized that a spatial interaction effect exists essentially\ndue to the spatial spillover and the third country effect. This motivates the\nintroduction of the spatial autoregressive components in the so-called spatial\ngravity model of trade. A so-called weight matrix is used in order to define\nthe set of the spatial neighbors and it is traditionally based on the inverse\nof the distance. Two issues follow from this standard procedure: the first\nregards the biasness of the distance if it is used as a proxy of the transport\ncosts in a panel data, the second is related to the collinearity emerging if we\nuse distance twice. So, several attempt were made in the recent literature\nhaving the scope of remove the distance. We propose a theoretically consistent\nprocedure based on Anderson, Van Wincoop derivation model, and some ad-hoc\ntests, relating to this attempt. The empirical results based on a 22-years\npanel of OECD countries are conforting, and they allow us to estimate the model\nwithout the distance, if properly replaced by a set of fixed effects.

Some evolve slowly, resembling models of 'pair-instability'\nsupernovae. Such models involve stars with original masses 140-260 times that\nof the Sun that now have carbon-oxygen cores of 65-30 solar masses. In these\nstars, the photons that prevent gravitational collapse are converted to\nelectron-positron pairs, causing rapid contraction and thermonuclear\nexplosions. Many solar masses of 56Ni are synthesized; this isotope decays to\n56Fe via 56Co, powering bright light curves. Such massive progenitors are\nexpected to have formed from metal-poor gas in the early Universe. Recently,\nsupernova 2007bi in a galaxy at redshift 0.127 (about 12 billion years after\nthe Big Bang) with a metallicity one-third that of the Sun was observed to look\nlike a fading pair-instability supernova. Here we report observations of two\nslow-to-fade super-luminous supernovae that show relatively fast rise times and\nblue colours, which are incompatible with pair-instability models. Their\nlate-time light-curve and spectral similarities to supernova 2007bi call the\nnature of that event into question. Our early spectra closely resemble typical\nfast-declining super-luminous supernovae, which are not powered by\nradioactivity. Modelling our observations with 10-16 solar masses of\nmagnetar-energized ejecta demonstrates the possibility of a common explosion\nmechanism. The lack of unambiguous nearby pair-instability events suggests that\ntheir local rate of occurrence is less than 6x10^-6 times that of the\ncore-collapse rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Oct 2013 16:53:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Oct 2016 22:09:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-12"}

The latter extension is also called areal geometry in some references.\nOn Finsler (Kawaguchi) manifold, we can define a reparameterisation invariant 1\n(k)-dimensional area by the Hilbert (Kawaguchi) form, which we take as an\naction. The equation of motion obtained from such action also has the property\nof reparameterisation invariance. In this framework, the solution manifold of\nthe Euler-Lagrange equation is realised as a submanifold of Finsler/Kawaguchi\nmanifold, and no fibered structure over the parameter space is needed. We also\nshow that for the case of first order k-dimensional parameter space and second\norder 1-dimensional parameter space, a global Lagrangian could be constructed.\nFor second order k-dimensional parameter space, Lagrangian is not global but it\nstill has the reparameterisation invariant property.

Despite there being much\nrecent interest within the machine learning community about copula\nrepresentations, there has been scarce research into the CDN, its amalgamation\nwith copula theory, and no evaluation of its performance. Algorithms for\ninference, sampling, and learning in these models are underdeveloped compared\nthose of other PGMs, hindering widerspread use.\n  One advantage of the CDN is that it allows the factors to be parameterized as\ncopulae, combining the benefits of graphical models with those of copula\ntheory. In brief, the use of a copula parameterization enables greater\nmodelling flexibility by separating representation of the marginals from the\ndependence structure, permitting more efficient and robust learning. Another\nadvantage is that the CDN permits the representation of implicit latent\nvariables, whose parameterization and connectivity are not required to be\nspecified. Unfortunately, that the model can encode only latent relationships\nbetween variables severely limits its utility.\n  In this thesis, we present inference, learning, and sampling for CDNs, and\nfurther the state-of-the-art. First, we explain the basics of copula theory and\nthe representation of copula CDNs. Then, we discuss inference in the models,\nand develop the first sampling algorithm. We explain standard learning methods,\npropose an algorithm for learning from data missing completely at random\n(MCAR), and develop a novel algorithm for learning models of arbitrary\ntreewidth and size. Properties of the models and algorithms are investigated\nthrough Monte Carlo simulations. We conclude with further discussion of the\nadvantages and limitations of CDNs, and suggest future work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Oct 2013 17:33:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-17"}

Recently, attention has\nbeen given to embedding shapes into the eigenspace of the Lapalce-Beltrami\noperator. The Laplace-Beltrami eigenspace preserves the diffusion distance, and\nis invariant under isometric transformations.

Such a remnant has been proposed as an\nexplanation for the late X-ray emission observed following some short duration\ngamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and as possible electromagnetic counterparts to the\ngravitational wave chirp. A stable NS merger remnant necessarily possesses a\nlarge rotational energy > 1e52 erg, the majority of which is ultimately\ndeposited into the surrounding circumburst medium (CBM) at mildly relativistic\nvelocities. We present Very Large Array radio observations of 7 short GRBs,\nsome of which possessed temporally extended X-ray emission, on timescales of\n~1-3 years following the initial burst. No radio sources were detected, with\ntypical upper limits ~0.3 mJy at 1.4 GHz. A basic model for the synchrotron\nemission from the blast wave is used to constrain the presence of a long-lived\nNS merger remnant in each system. Depending on the GRB, our non-detections\ntranslate into upper limits on the CBM density n < 3e-2 - 3e-3 particles/cm^3\nrequired for consistency with the remnant hypothesis. Our upper limits rule out\na long-lived remnant in GRB 050724 and 060505, but cannot rule out such a\nremnant in other systems due to their lower inferred CBM densities based on\nafterglow modeling or the lack of such constraints. Additional VLA observations\nin the near future could place tighter limits on the presence of merger\nremnants in these system. The population of long-lived NS merger remnants will\nalso be constrained by their (non-)detection with upcoming radio transient\nsurveys.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Oct 2013 20:01:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

We then use a finite\nMarkov mixture of logit regressions on past squared returns to describe the\ndependence of the probability of price changes. The model can thus be seen as a\nDouble Chain Markov Model. We show that the model describes the shape of return\ndistribution at different time aggregations, volatility clustering, and the\nanomalous decrease of kurtosis of returns. We calibrate our models on Nasdaq\nstocks and we show that this model reproduces remarkably well the statistical\nproperties of real data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Oct 2013 22:33:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

Supposing that a small fraction of colored objects\nescaped hadronization and survived up to now in the form of quark-gluon nuggets\n(QNs), and also taking into account radiation, we investigate scalar\nperturbations of the FRW metrics due to inhomogeneities of dustlike matter as\nwell as fluctuations of QNs and radiation. In particular, we demonstrate that\nthe nonrelativistic gravitational potential is defined by the distribution of\ninhomogeneities/fluctuations of both dustlike matter and QNs. Consequently, QNs\ncan be distributed around the baryonic inhomogeneities (e.g., galaxies) in such\na way that it can solve the problem of the flatness of the rotation curves. We\nalso show that the fluctuations of radiation are caused by both the\ninhomogeneities in the form of galaxies and the fluctuations of quark-gluon\nnuggets. Therefore, if QNs exist, the CMB anisotropy should contain also the\ncontributions from QNs. Additionally, the spatial distribution of the radiation\nfluctuations is defined by the gravitational potential.

A stepping\nstone or an anonymity network may try to prevent flow correlation by adding\nchaff traffic, splitting the flow in several subflows or adding random delays.\nA well-known attack for these types of systems is active watermarking. However,\nactive watermarking systems can be detected and an attacker can modify the flow\nin such a way that the watermark is removed and can no longer be decoded. This\nleads to the two basic features of our scheme: a highlyoptimized algorithm that\nachieves very good performance and a passive analysis that is undetectable. We\npropose a new passive analysis technique where detection is based on\nNeyman-Pearson lemma. We correlate the inter-packet delays (IPDs) from both\nflows.

Both systematic model\ndependent and statistically correlated uncertainties need to be considered. An\napplication where realistic uncertainty assessments are especially important is\nthe intermediate neutron capture process or i process: a neutron capture regime\nwith neutron densities intermediate between the slow and rapid processes.\nAccordingly, the main network flux proceeds on the neutron-rich unstable\nisotopes up to 4-5 species off the valley of stability. The i process has been\nclearly identified to be active in post-AGB stars during the Very Late Thermal\nPulse H-ingestion event, and a recent work infers about its important role in\nearly generations of stars. Here we demonstrate the effect of propagating\nsystematic nuclear uncertainties from different theoretical models to final\nabundances for a region around the 2$^\\mathrm{nd}$ peak at $A-Z=80$ for\nelemental ratio predictions involving Ba, La and Eu in i-process conditions.\nThese elements are used to distinguish different n-capture contributions\nobserved in low-metallicity stars. For the simple 1-zone model adopted here,\npredictions vary as much as a factor of 22 in on possible observational plane\n([La/Eu] vs. [Ba/La]). To consider statistically correlated uncertainties, we\nsimilarly perform a full nuclear physics uncertainty study within a given\nHauser-Feshbach model and demonstrate the role of correlations on the final\nstellar abundance uncertainties. We show that in i-process conditions the main\nresult of neglecting correlations is to underestimate the impact of nuclear\nuncertainties on the final nucleosynthesis yields by as much as two orders of\nmagnitude.

Recently, an energy-efficient\nselective decode-and-forward protocol was proposed for FDR, and was shown to\noutperform existing schemes in terms of outage. Here, we propose an incremental\nselective decode-and-forward protocol that offers additional power savings,\nwhile keeping the same outage performance. We compare the performance of the\ntwo protocols in terms of the end-to-end signal-to-noise ratio cumulative\ndistribution function via closed-form expressions. Finally, we corroborate our\ntheoretical results with simulation, and show the relative relay power savings\nin comparison to non-selective cooperation in which the relay cooperates\nregardless of channel conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Oct 2013 07:19:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-18"}

A cluster embedded in a self-consistent bath is studied. With\nincreasing Coulomb repulsion, U, the antinodal point [k=(pi,0)] displays a\ngradual suppression of spectral density of states around the Fermi energy which\nis not observed at the nodal point [k=(pi/2,pi/2)]. The opening of the\nantinodal pseudogap is related to the internal structure of the cluster and the\nmuch weaker bath-cluster couplings at the antinodal than nodal point. The role\nplayed by internal cluster correlations is elucidated from a simple four-level\nmodel. For small U, the cluster levels form Kondo singlets with their baths\nleading to a peak in the spectral density. As U is increased a localized state\nis formed localizing the electrons in the cluster. If this cluster localized\nstate is non-degenerate, the Kondo effect is destroyed and a pseudogap opens up\nin the spectra at the anti-nodal point. The pseudogap can be understood in\nterms of destructive interference between different paths for electrons hopping\nbetween the cluster and the bath. However, electrons at the nodal points remain\nin Kondo states up to larger U since they are more strongly coupled to the\nbath. The strong correlation between the (pi,0) and (0,pi) cluster levels in\nthe localized state leads to a large correlation energy gain which is important\nfor localizing electrons and opening up a pseudogap. Such scenario is in\ncontrast with two independent Mott transitions found in two-band systems with\ndifferent bandwidths in which the localized cluster electron does not correlate\nstrongly with any other cluster electron for intermediate U. The important\nintracluster sector correlations are associated with the resonating valence\nbond (RVB) character of the cluster.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Oct 2013 07:20:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-02"}

We propose a prescription to implement\nT-duality on the three point functions and N-point functions. We argue that it\nis possible to generate new amplitudes through the transformations on a given\namplitude just as T-duality transformations can take us to a new set of string\nvacuum when acted upon an initial set. Explicit examples are given for three\npoint and four point functions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Oct 2013 09:26:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

A bimodal high temperature component is also\nfound for several events, with peaks at 8 and 25 MK during the impulsive phase.\nThe origin of the emission was verified using AIA images to be the flare\nribbons and footpoints, indicating that the constructed DEMs represent the\nspatially-average thermal structure of the chromospheric flare emission during\nthe impulsive phase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Oct 2013 10:28:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

In this paper, we describe a second dynamical parameter\nfor globular clusters, the encounter rate for a single binary, gamma. We find\nthat this parameter provides a good characterization of the differences between\nthe pulsar populations of different globular clusters. The higher gamma is for\nany particular globular cluster the more isolated pulsars and products of\nexchange interactions are observed. Furthermore, we also find that slow and\n\"young\" pulsars are found almost exclusively in clusters with a high gamma;\nthis suggests that these kinds of objects are formed by the disruption of X-ray\nbinaries, thus halting the recycling of a previously dead neutron star. We\ndiscuss the implications of this for the nature of young pulsars and for the\nformation of neutron stars in globular clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Oct 2013 12:09:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

Thirty-six observatories\nin sixteen countries participated in this continuous monitoring program and\ntwenty of them submitted data for compilation into a continuous light curve.\nThe light curve was analyzed using several techniques including Fourier\ntransform, Wavelet and noise analysis techniques. Those results led us to model\nthe light curve by attributing the variations to a series of synchrotron\npulses. Results. We have interpreted the observed microvariations in this\nextended light curve in terms of a new model consisting of individual\nstochastic pulses due to cells in a turbulent jet which are energized by a\npassing shock and cool by means of synchrotron emission.

Here we model and test these\nprocesses by examining the consistency with the observed variation of the\nextinction curves in the Milky Way. We find that, if we simply use the\nparameters used in previous studies, the model fails to explain the flattening\nof far-UV extinction curve for large $R_V$ (flatness of optical extinction\ncurve) and the existence of carbon bump even in flat extinction curves. This\ndiscrepancy is resolved by adopting a `tuned' model, in which coagulation of\ncarbonaceous dust is less efficient (by a factor of 2) and that of silicate is\nmore efficient with the coagulation threshold removed. The tuned model is also\nconsistent with the relation between silicon depletion (indicator of accretion)\nand $R_V$ if the duration of accretion and coagulation is >100(n_H/10^3\ncm^{-3})^{-1} Myr, where n_H is the number density of hydrogen nuclei in the\ncloud. We also examine the relations between each of the extinction curve\nfeatures (UV slope, far-UV curvature, and carbon bump strength) and $R_V$. The\ncorrelation between UV slope and $R_V$, which is the strongest among the three\ncorrelations, is well reproduced by the tuned model. For far-UV curvature and\ncarbon bump strength, the observational data are located between the tuned\nmodel and the original model without tuning, implying that the large scatters\nin the observational data can be explained by the sensitive response to the\ncoagulation efficiency. The overall success of the tuned model indicates that\naccretion and coagulation are promising mechanisms of producing the variation\nof extinction curves in the Milky Way, although we do not exclude possibilities\nof other dust-processing mechanisms changing extinction curves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Oct 2013 12:54:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

In addition, we also investigate the corresponding emission\nspectrum and verify the directed emission for the timed Dicke state for a large\natomic sample.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Oct 2013 13:02:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 Dec 2013 11:35:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-22"}

It relies on an automatic digitization of high-resolution photographs\nand on the spatial Fourier spectrum analysis of the stylolite traces. We test\nand show, on both synthetic and natural examples, that the information from\nthis outer cylindrical surface is equivalent to the one obtained from the\ndestructive planar sections traditionally used. The assessment of paleostress\nfrom the stylolite morphology analysis is made using a recent theoretical\nmodel, which links the morphological properties to the physical processes\nacting during stylolite evolution. This model shows that two scaling regimes\nare to be expected for the stylolite height power spectrum, separated by a\ncross-over length that depends on the magnitude of the paleostress during\nformation. We develop a non linear fit method to automatically extract the\ncross-over lengths from the digitized stylolite profiles. Results on cores from\nboreholes drilled in the surroundings of the Andra Underground Research\nLaboratory located at Bure, France, show that different groups of sedimentary\nstylolites can be distinguished, and correspond to different estimated vertical\npaleostress values. For the Oxfordian formation, one group of stylolites\nindicate a paleostress of around 10 MPa, while another group yields 15 MPa. For\nthe Dogger formation, two stylolites indicate a paleostress of around 10 MPa,\nwhile others appear to have stopped growing at paleostresses between 30 and 22\nMPa, starting at an erosion phase that initiated in the late Cretaceous and\ncontinues today. This method has a high potential for further applications on\nreservoirs or other geological contexts where stylolites are present.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Oct 2013 13:04:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-18"}

There are two principle\ntypes of MCS, one is the Rigid Multiple Camera System (RMCS); the other is the\nArticulated Camera System (ACS). In a RMCS, the relative poses (relative 3-D\nposition and orientation) between the cameras are invariant. While, in an ACS,\nthe cameras are articulated through movable joints, the relative pose between\nthem may change. Therefore, through calibration of an ACS we want to find not\nonly the relative poses between the cameras but also the positions of the\njoints in the ACS.\n  In this paper, we developed calibration algorithms for the ACS using a simple\nconstraint: the joint is fixed relative to the cameras connected with it during\nthe transformations of the ACS. When the transformations of the cameras in an\nACS can be estimated relative to the same coordinate system, the positions of\nthe joints in the ACS can be calculated by solving linear equations. However,\nin a non-overlapping view ACS, only the ego-transformations of the cameras and\ncan be estimated. We proposed a two-steps method to deal with this problem. In\nboth methods, the ACS is assumed to have performed general transformations in a\nstatic environment. The efficiency and robustness of the proposed methods are\ntested by simulation and real experiments. In the real experiment, the\nintrinsic and extrinsic parameters of the ACS are obtained simultaneously by\nour calibration procedure using the same image sequences, no extra data\ncapturing step is required. The corresponding trajectory is recovered and\nillustrated using the calibration results of the ACS. Since the estimated\ntranslations of different cameras in an ACS may scaled by different scale\nfactors, a scale factor estimation algorithm is also proposed. To our\nknowledge, we are the first to study the calibration of ACS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Oct 2013 14:26:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-18"}

SOSTOOLS was\noriginally envisioned as a flexible tool for parsing and solving polynomial\noptimization problems, using the SOS tightening of polynomial positivity\nconstraints, and capable of adapting to the ever-evolving fauna of applications\nof SOS. There are now a variety of SOS programming parsers beyond SOSTOOLS,\nincluding YALMIP, Gloptipoly, SumOfSquares, and others. We hope SOSTOOLS\nremains the most intuitive, robust and adaptable toolbox for SOS programming.\nRecent progress in Semidefinite programming has opened up new possibilities for\nsolving large Sum of Squares programming problems, and we hope the next decade\nwill be one where SOS methods will find wide application in different areas.\n  In SOSTOOLS v4.00, we implement a parsing approach that reduces the\ncomputational and memory requirements of the parser below that of the SDP\nsolver itself. We have re-developed the internal structure of our polynomial\ndecision variables. Specifically, polynomial and SOS variable declarations made\nusing sossosvar, sospolyvar, sosmatrixvar, etc now return a new polynomial\nstructure, dpvar. This new polynomial structure, is documented in the enclosed\ndpvar guide, and isolates the scalar SDP decision variables in the SOS program\nfrom the independent variables used to construct the SOS program. As a result,\nthe complexity of the parser scales almost linearly in the number of decision\nvariables. As a result of these changes, almost all users will notice a\nsignificant increase in speed, with large-scaleproblems experiencing the most\ndramatic speedups. Parsing time is now always less than 10% of time spent in\nthe SDP solver. Finally, SOSTOOLS now provides support for the MOSEK solver\ninterface as well as the SeDuMi, SDPT3, CSDP, SDPNAL, SDPNAL+, and SDPA\nsolvers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Oct 2013 14:30:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Dec 2021 23:37:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-30"}

We investigated the\ntiming properties of IGR J18483-0311 and studied the spectra during bright\noutbursts by fitting physical models based on thermal and bulk Comptonization\nprocesses for accreting compact objects. We analysed archival INTEGRAL data\ncollected in the period 2003-2010, focusing on the observations with IGR\nJ18483-0311 in outburst. We searched for pulsations in the INTEGRAL light\ncurves of each outburst. We took advantage of the broadband observing\ncapability of INTEGRAL for the spectral analysis. We observed 15 outbursts,\nseven of which we report here for the first time. This data analysis almost\ndoubles the statistics of flares of this binary system detected by INTEGRAL. A\nrefined timing analysis did not reveal a significant periodicity in the\nINTEGRAL observation where a ~21s pulsation was previously detected. Neither\ndid we find evidence for pulsations in the X-ray light curve of an archival\nXMM-Newton observation of IGR J18483-0311. In the light of these results the\nnature of the compact object in IGR J18483-0311 is unclear. The broadband X-ray\nspectrum of IGR J18483-0311 in outburst is well fitted by a thermal and bulk\nComptonization model of blackbody seed photons by the infalling material in the\naccretion column of a neutron star. We also obtained a new measurement of the\norbital period using the Swift/BAT light curve.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Oct 2013 14:47:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

Hence, accurate knowledge of the rotation rates of such massive\nstars is critical for understanding their properties and for constraining\nmodels of their evolution. Aims: This paper investigates the reliability of\ncurrent methods used to derive projected rotation speeds v sin i from\nline-broadening signatures in the photospheric spectra of massive stars,\nfocusing on stars that are not rapidly rotating. Methods: We use slowly\nrotating magnetic O-stars with well-determined rotation periods to test the\nFourier transform (FT) and goodness-of-fit (GOF) methods typically used to\ninfer projected rotation rates of massive stars. Results: For our two magnetic\ntest stars with measured rotation periods longer than one year, i.e., with v\nsin i < 1 km/s, we derive v sin i ~ 40-50 km/s from both the FT and GOF\nmethods. These severe overestimates are most likely caused by an insufficient\ntreatment of the competing broadening mechanisms referred to as microturbulence\nand macroturbulence. Conclusions: These findings warn us not to rely\nuncritically on results from current standard techniques to derive projected\nrotation speeds of massive stars in the presence of significant additional line\nbroadening, at least when v sin i <~ 50 km/s. This may, for example, be crucial\nfor i) determining the statistical distribution of observed rotation rates of\nmassive stars, ii) interpreting the evolutionary status and spin-down histories\nof rotationally braked B-supergiants, and iii) explaining the deficiency of\nobserved O-stars with spectroscopically inferred v sin i ~ 0 km/s. Further\ninvestigations of potential shortcomings of the above techniques are presently\nunder way.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Oct 2013 14:47:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

The technique is based on probabilistic model\nchecking. We adapt the general definition of robustness introduced by Kitano to\nthe class of stochastic systems modelled as continuous time Markov Chains in\norder to extensively analyse and compare robustness of biological models with\nuncertain parameters. The framework utilises novel computational methods that\nenable to effectively evaluate the robustness of models with respect to\nquantitative temporal properties and parameters such as reaction rate constants\nand initial conditions.\n  The framework is applied to gene regulation as an example of a central\nbiological mechanism where intrinsic and extrinsic stochasticity plays crucial\nrole due to low numbers of DNA and RNA molecules.

To tackle such a diversity of\ndata, many techniques have been devised. However, despite the long tradition of\npattern recognition research, there is no technique that yields the best\nclassification in all scenarios. Therefore, the consideration of as many as\npossible techniques presents itself as an fundamental practice in applications\naiming at high accuracy. Typical works comparing methods either emphasize the\nperformance of a given algorithm in validation tests or systematically compare\nvarious algorithms, assuming that the practical use of these methods is done by\nexperts. In many occasions, however, researchers have to deal with their\npractical classification tasks without an in-depth knowledge about the\nunderlying mechanisms behind parameters. Actually, the adequate choice of\nclassifiers and parameters alike in such practical circumstances constitutes a\nlong-standing problem and is the subject of the current paper. We carried out a\nstudy on the performance of nine well-known classifiers implemented by the Weka\nframework and compared the dependence of the accuracy with their configuration\nparameter configurations. The analysis of performance with default parameters\nrevealed that the k-nearest neighbors method exceeds by a large margin the\nother methods when high dimensional datasets are considered. When other\nconfiguration of parameters were allowed, we found that it is possible to\nimprove the quality of SVM in more than 20% even if parameters are set\nrandomly. Taken together, the investigation conducted in this paper suggests\nthat, apart from the SVM implementation, Weka's default configuration of\nparameters provides an performance close the one achieved with the optimal\nconfiguration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Oct 2013 03:44:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-28"}
