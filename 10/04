The\npresent work is prompted by questions put by Mario Livio in his latest book\n\"Brilliant Blunders\" as to the phrase \"biggest blunder\": Did Einstein actually\nsay, \"biggest blunder\"?

Among other ubiquitous long time properties, this process\nexhibits aging: events counted initially in a time interval [0,t] statistically\nstrongly differ from those observed at later times [t_a,t_a+t]. In complex,\ndisordered media, processes with scale-free waiting times play a particularly\nprominent role. We set up a unified analytical foundation for such anomalous\ndynamics by discussing in detail the distribution of the aging renewal process.\nWe analyze its half-discrete, half-continuous nature and study its aging time\nevolution. These results are readily used to discuss a scale-free anomalous\ndiffusion process, the continuous time random walk. By this we not only shed\nlight on the profound origins of its characteristic features, such as weak\nergodicity breaking. Along the way, we also add an extended discussion on aging\neffects.

This requires either a framing or a corner structure. The\ncanonical framing provides a minimum for the classical action and the change of\nframing encodes the structure of the action and possible anomalies. We\ncharacterize the flux quantization condition on the C-field and the topological\naction of the M5-brane via the Hopf invariant, and the dual of the C-field as\n(a refinement of) an element of Hopf invariant two. In the signature\nformulation, the contribution to the M-brane effective action is given by the\nMaslov index of the corner. The Kervaire invariant implies that the effective\naction of the M5-brane is quadratic. Our study leads to viewing the self-dual\nstring, which is the boundary of the M2-brane on the M5-brane worldvolume, as a\nstring theory in the sense of cobordism of manifolds with corners.

The inflow is dissipative when its timescale is shorter than the star\nformation timescale. This implies a threshold of 0.28 in the cold-to-total mass\nratio within the disc radius.

The internal energy of such systems lacks extensivity and\nadditivity. Although the extensivity can be restored by scaling the interaction\npotential with the number of particles, the non-additivity still remains. Lack\nof additivity leads to inequivalence of statistical ensembles. Before relaxing\nto thermodynamic equilibrium, isolated systems with LR forces become trapped in\nout-of-equilibrium quasi-stationary state (qSS), the lifetime of which diverges\nwith the number of particles. Therefore, in thermodynamic limit LR systems will\nnot relax to equilibrium. The qSSs are attained through the process of\ncollisionless relaxation.

This implies a new scale of physics and mediator particles to\nfacilitate dark matter annihilation. In this work, we focus on dark matter that\nannihilates through a generic Higgs portal. We show how partial wave unitarity\nplaces an upper bound on the mass of the mediator (or dark) Higgs when its mass\nis increased to be the largest scale in the effective theory. For models where\nthe dark matter annihilates via fermion exchange, an upper bound is generated\nwhen unitarity breaks down around 8.5 TeV. Models where the dark matter\nannihilates via fermion and higgs boson exchange push the bound to 45.5 TeV. We\nalso show that if dark matter obtains all of its mass from a new symmetry\nbreaking scale that scale is also constrained. We improve these constraints by\nrequiring perturbativity in the Higgs sector up to each unitarity bound. In\nthis limit, the bounds on the dark symmetry breaking vev and the dark Higgs\nmass are now 2.4 and 3 TeV, respectively, when the dark matter annihilates via\nfermion exchange. When dark matter annihilates via fermion and higgs boson\nexchange, the bounds are now 12 and 14.2 TeV, respectively. The available\nparameter space for Higgs portal dark matter annihilation is outlined. We also\nshow how the bounds are improved if Higgs portal dark matter is only a fraction\nof the observed relic abundance. Finally, we discuss how to apply these\narguments to other dark matter scenarios and discuss prospects for direct\ndetection and future collider searches. If the Higgs portal is responsible for\ndark matter annihilation, planned direct detection experiments will cover\nalmost all the parameter space. The ILC and/or VLHC, however, is needed to\nestablish the Higgs portal mechanism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Oct 2013 20:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-07"}

This is in contrast to many older\nstar clusters that show a decreasing binary frequency with radius.

We find that many of these models\ncan reproduce the cluster's observed properties, although with a modest\npreference for substructured initial conditions. Our models produce the\nobserved radial trend in binary frequency through disruption of soft binaries\n(with semi-major axes, a > 3000 AU), on approximately a crossing time (~ 5.4\nMyr), preferentially in the cluster core. Mass segregation subsequently causes\nthe binaries to sink towards the core. After roughly one initial half-mass\nrelaxation time (t_rh(0) ~ 340 Myr) the radial binary frequency distribution\nbecomes bimodal, the innermost binaries having already segregated towards the\ncore, leaving a minimum in the radial binary frequency distribution that\nmarches outwards with time. After 4-6 t_rh(0), the rising distribution in the\nhalo disappears, leaving a radial distribution that rises only towards the\ncore. Thus, both a radial binary frequency distribution that falls towards the\ncore (as observed for NGC 1818) and one that rises towards the core (as for\nolder star clusters) can arise naturally from the same evolutionary sequence\nowing to binary disruption and mass segregation in rich star clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Oct 2013 20:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

In the present study we investigate\nsemi-analytically their evolution following the contraction of a synthetic\npopulation of clumps with varied initial structure and orbits coupled with the\nsurrounding disk and the central star. Our model is based on recently published\nstate-of-the-art 3D collapse simulations of clumps with varied thermodynamics.\nVarious evolutionary mechanisms are taken into account, and their effect is\nexplored both individually and in combination with others: migration and tidal\ndisruption, mass accretion, gap opening and disk viscosity.

Extrapolating to\nmillion year timescales, all our surviving protoplanets would lead to close-in\ngas giants.

The proof of consistency is based on the construction of a target\nenergy functional whose unique minimizer is actually the given probability\nmeasure \\omega to be quantized. Then we show that the discrete functionals,\ndefining the discrete quantizers as their minimizers, actually \\Gamma-converge\nto the target energy with respect to the narrow topology on the space of\nprobability measures. A key ingredient is the reformulation of the target\nfunctional by means of a Fourier representation, which extends the\ncharacterization of conditionally positive semi-definite functions from points\nin generic position to probability measures. As a byproduct of the Fourier\nrepresentation, we also obtain compactness of sublevels of the target energy in\nterms of uniform moment bounds, which already found applications in the\nasymptotic analysis of corresponding gradient flows. To model situations where\nthe given probability is affected by noise, we additionally consider a modified\nenergy, with the addition of a regularizing total variation term and we\ninvestigate again its point mass approximations in terms of \\Gamma-convergence.\nWe show that such a discrete measure representation of the total variation can\nbe interpreted as an additional nonlinear potential, repulsive at a short\nrange, attractive at a medium range, and at a long range not having effect,\npromoting a uniform distribution of the point masses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Oct 2013 21:18:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-07"}

However, the problem of tracking where particular edges go during the\nflipping process has not been addressed. We examine this question by attaching\nunique labels to the triangulation edges. We introduce the concept of the orbit\nof an edge $e$, which is the set of all edges reachable from $e$ via flips.\n  We establish the first upper and lower bounds on the diameter of the flip\ngraph in this setting. Specifically, we prove tight $\\Theta(n \\log n)$ bounds\nfor edge-labelled triangulations of $n$-vertex convex polygons and\ncombinatorial triangulations, contrasting with the $\\Theta(n)$ bounds in their\nrespective unlabelled settings. The $\\Omega(n \\log n)$ lower bound for the\nconvex polygon setting might be of independent interest, as it generalizes\nlower bounds on certain sorting models. When simultaneous flips are allowed,\nthe upper bound for convex polygons decreases to $O(\\log^2 n)$, although we no\nlonger have a matching lower bound.\n  Moving beyond convex polygons, we show that edge-labelled triangulated\npolygons with a single reflex vertex can have a disconnected flip graph. This\nis in sharp contrast with the unlabelled case, where the flip graph is\nconnected for any triangulated polygon. For spiral polygons, we provide a\ncomplete characterization of the orbits. This allows us to decide connectivity\nof the flip graph of a spiral polygon in linear time.

Moreover, the variability at different\ntime-scales and energy bands of the peak flux level is always greater than or\nequal to the variability of the dip flux level, which strengthens the\npossibility that the peak flux level may be due to an independent spectral\ncomponent added to the dip one.

As a parametric process, high harmonic\ngeneration should conserve the radiation energy, momentum and angular momentum.\nIndeed, conservation of energy and momentum have been demonstrated. Angular\nmomentum of optical beams can be divided into two components: orbital and spin\n(polarization). Orbital angular momentum is assumed to be conserved and\nrecently observed deviations were attributed to propagation effects. On the\nother hand, conservation of spin angular momentum has thus far never been\nstudied, neither experimentally nor theoretically. Here, we present the first\nstudy on the role of spin angular momentum in extreme nonlinear optics by\nexperimentally generating high harmonics of bi chromatic elliptically polarized\npump beams that interact with isotropic media. While observing that the\nselection rules qualitatively correspond to spin conservation, we unequivocally\nfind that the process of converting pump photons into a single high-energy\nphoton does not conserve angular momentum, i.e. this process is not self\ncontained. In one regime, we numerically find that this major fundamental\ndiscrepancy can be explained if the harmonic photons are emitted in pairs. Yet\nin another regime, the ionizing electron carries the missing angular momentum.\nThe results presented here, apart from exploring the very foundations of HHG,\nare also important for a variety of applications, as our system exhibits full\ncontrol over the harmonics polarization, from circular through elliptical to\nlinear polarization, without comprising the efficiency of the process.

The SCFT has enjoyed\nconsidered success and wide usage in investigation of the complex phase\nbehavior of block copolymers. It is well-known that the physical solutions of\nthe SCFT equations are saddle points, however, the analytic structure of the\nSCFT energy functional has received little attention over the years. A recent\nwork by Fredrickson and collaborators [see the monograph by Fredrickson, The\nEquilibrium Theory of Inhomogeneous Polymers, (2006), pp. 203-209] has analysed\nthe mathematical structure of the field energy functional for polymeric\nsystems, and clarified the index-1 saddle point nature of the problem produced\nby the incompressibility constraint. In this paper, our goals are to draw\nfurther attention to multicomponent block copolymers utilizing the\nHubbard-Stratonovich transformation used by Fredrickson and co-workers. We\nfirst show that the saddle point character of the SCFT energy functional of\nmulticomponent block copolymer systems may be high index, not only produced by\nthe incompressibility constraint, but also by the Flory-Huggins interaction\nparameters. Our analysis will be beneficial to many theoretical studies, such\nas the nucleation theory of ordered phases, the mesoscopic dynamics. As an\napplication, we then utilize the discovery to develop the gradient-based\niterative schemes to solve the SCFT equations, and illustrate its performance\nthrough several numerical experiments taking ABC star triblock copolymers as an\nexample.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Oct 2013 13:39:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-07"}

In recent\nyears, several methods have been proposed to model nonlinear relationships when\nthe number of covariates exceeds the number of observations by using spline\nbasis functions and group penalties. Nonlinear {\\it monotone} effects on the\nresponse play a central role in many situations, in particular in medicine and\nbiology. We construct the monotone splines lasso (MS-lasso) to select variables\nand estimate effects using monotone spline (I-splines). The additive components\nin the model are represented by their I-spline basis function expansion and the\ncomponent selection becomes that of selecting the groups of coefficients in the\nI-spline basis function expansion. We use a recent procedure, called\ncooperative lasso, to select sign-coherent groups, that is selecting the groups\nwith either exclusively non-negative or non-positive coefficients. This leads\nto the selection of important covariates that have nonlinear monotone\nincreasing or decreasing effect on the response. We also introduce an adaptive\nversion of the MS-lasso which reduces both the bias and the number of false\npositive selections considerably. We compare the MS-lasso and the adaptive\nMS-lasso with other existing methods for variable selection in high dimensions\nby simulation and illustrate the method on two relevant genomic data sets.\nResults indicate that the (adaptive) MS-lasso has excellent properties compared\nto the other methods both by means of estimation and selection, and can be\nrecommended for high-dimensional monotone regression.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Oct 2013 14:13:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-07"}

As one main conclusion, we predict negative Wigner\nfunctions to be observable even for surprisingly classical parameters, i.e.\noutside the single-photon strong coupling regime, for strong cavity drive, and\nrather large limit cycle amplitudes. The general approach taken here provides a\nnatural starting point for further studies of quantum effects in optomechanics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Oct 2013 14:41:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Feb 2014 15:03:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-11"}

Our analysis is based on a\nmulti type branching process: We model individual cells which can either divide\nor undergo apoptosis. In case of a cell division, the two daughter cells can\nmutate, which potentially confers a change in fitness to the cell. In contrast\nto previous models, the change in fitness induced by the driver mutation\ndepends on the genetic context of the cell, in our case on the number of\npassenger mutations. The passenger mutations themselves have no or only a very\nsmall impact on the cell's fitness. While our model is not designed as a\nspecific model for a particular cancer, the underlying idea is motivated by\nclinical and experimental observations in Burkitt Lymphoma. In this tumor, the\nhallmark mutation leads to deregulation of the MYC oncogene which increases the\nrate of apoptosis, but also the proliferation rate of cells. This increase in\nthe rate of apoptosis hence needs to be overcome by mutations affecting\napoptotic pathways, naturally leading to an epistatic fitness landscape. This\nmodel shows a very interesting dynamical behavior which is distinct from the\ndynamics of cancer initiation in the absence of epistasis. Since the driver\nmutation is deleterious to a cell with only a few passenger mutations, there is\na period of stasis in the number of cells until a clone of cells with enough\npassenger mutations emerges. Only when the driver mutation occurs in one of\nthose cells, the cell population starts to grow rapidly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Oct 2013 06:45:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Apr 2015 07:21:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-14"}

Servers are typically clustered according to the service they\nprovide whether it be the application(s) installed, the role of the server or\nserver accessibility for example. In order to optimize performance, manage load\nand maintain availability, servers may migrate from one cluster group to\nanother making it difficult for server monitoring tools to continuously monitor\nthese dynamically changing groups. Server monitoring tools are usually\nstatically configured and with any change of group membership requires manual\nreconfiguration; an unreasonable task to undertake on large-scale cloud\ninfrastructures.\n  In this paper we present the Cloudlet Control and Management System (C2MS); a\nsystem for monitoring and controlling dynamic groups of physical or virtual\nservers within cloud infrastructures. The C2MS extends Ganglia - an open source\nscalable system performance monitoring tool - by allowing system administrators\nto define, monitor and modify server groups without the need for server\nreconfiguration. In turn administrators can easily monitor group and individual\nserver metrics on large-scale dynamic cloud infrastructures where roles of\nservers may change frequently. Furthermore, we complement group monitoring with\na control element allowing administrator-specified actions to be performed over\nservers within service groups as well as introduce further customized\nmonitoring metrics.

A generic 3D crystal in contact with vacuum\ncontaining about 10^8 atoms and with a sinusoidal free surface roughness is\nshock loaded so as to undergo a solid-liquid phase change on shock. The\nreflection of the shock wave at the interface metal/vacuum gives rise to the\nejection of 2D jets/sheets of atoms (Richtmyer-Meshkov instabilities in the\ncontinuum limit) which develop and break up, forming ejecta (fragments) of\ndifferent volumes (or mass). The fragmentation process is investigated by\nanalyzing the evolution of the resulting volume distribution of the ejecta as a\nfunction of time. Two metals are studied (Cu and Sn) and the amplitude of the\nroughness is varied. The simulations show that the associated distributions\nexhibit a generic behavior with the sum of two distinct terms of varying\nweight, following the expansion rate of the jets: in the small size limit, the\ndistribution obeys a power law dependence with an exponent equal to 1.15 plus\nor minus 0.08 and in the large size limit, it obeys an exponential form. These\ntwo components are interpreted, with the help of additional simple simulations,\nas the signature of two different basic mechanisms of fragmentation. The power\nlaw dependence results from the fragmentation of a 2D network of ligaments\narranged following a fractal (scale free) geometry and generated when the\nsheets of liquid metal expand and tear.
