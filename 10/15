Such quantum field theories are\nfound in approaches to quantum gravity related to Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) on\nthe one hand, and to matrix models and tensor models on the other hand. They\nmodel quantum space-time, in the sense that their Feynman amplitudes label\ntriangulations, which can be understood as transition amplitudes between LQG\nspin network states. The question of renormalizability is crucial if one wants\nto establish interesting GFTs as well-defined (perturbative) quantum field\ntheories, and in a second step connect them to known infrared gravitational\nphysics. Relying on recently developed tensorial tools, this thesis explores\nthe GFT formalism in two complementary directions. First, new results on the\nlarge cut-off expansion of the colored Boulatov-Ooguri models allow to explore\nfurther a non-perturbative regime in which infinitely many degrees of freedom\ncontribute. The second set of results provide a new rigorous framework for the\nrenormalization of so-called Tensorial GFTs (TGFTs) with gauge invariance\ncondition. In particular, a non-trivial 3d TGFT with gauge group SU(2) is\nproven just-renormalizable at the perturbative level, hence opening the way to\napplications of the formalism to (3d Euclidean) quantum gravity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Oct 2013 16:16:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-22"}

Network\nmodels with local excitation and broad inhibition support persistent neural\nactivity, linking network architecture and parametric working memory. Cortical\nneurons receive noisy input fluctuations which causes persistent activity to\ndiffusively wander about the network, degrading memory over time. We explore\nhow cortical architecture that supports parametric working memory affects the\ndiffusion of persistent neural activity. Studying both a spiking network and a\nsimplified potential well model, we show that spatially heterogeneous\nexcitatory coupling stabilizes a discrete number of persistent states, reducing\nthe diffusion of persistent activity over the network. However, heterogeneous\ncoupling also coarse-grains the stimulus representation space, limiting the\ncapacity of parametric working memory. The storage errors due to\ncoarse-graining and diffusion tradeoff so that information transfer between the\ninitial and recalled stimulus is optimized at a fixed network heterogeneity.\nFor sufficiently long delay times, the optimal number of attractors is less\nthan the number of possible stimuli, suggesting that memory networks can\nunder-represent stimulus space to optimize performance.

The\nsetting is the test of a well-specified null hypothesis (such as the Standard\nModel of elementary particle physics, possibly with \"nuisance parameters\")\nversus a composite alternative (such as the Standard Model plus a new force of\nnature of unknown strength). The p-value, as well as the ratio of the\nlikelihood under the null hypothesis to the maximized likelihood under the\nalternative, can strongly disfavor the null hypothesis, while the Bayesian\nposterior probability for the null hypothesis can be arbitrarily large. The\nacademic statistics literature contains many impassioned comments on this\nparadox, yet there is no consensus either on its relevance to scientific\ncommunication or on its correct resolution. The paradox is quite relevant to\nfrontier research in high energy physics.

The cross sections of these\nfilaments are typically partitioned into four quadrants with opposite vorticity\nsign, arising from multiple flows, originating from neighbouring walls.

The\nlocal black hole mass density is connected to the mean radiative efficiency of\naccretion through the time integral of the quasar volume density. The\ncorrespondence between this estimate of the radiative efficiency and that\nexpected theoretically from thin-disk accretion has long been used as an\nargument that most of the growth in black holes occurs via luminous accretion.\nThe increase of the mass density in black holes pushes the mean observed\nradiative efficiency to values below that expected for thin-disk accretion for\nany value of the black hole spin, including retrograde accretion disks. This\ncan be accommodated via black hole growth channels that are intrinsically\nradiatively inefficient, such as super-Eddington accretion, or via growth\nchannels that are intrinsically radiatively efficient but for which few of the\nphotons are observed, such as Compton thick accretion. Measurements of the 30\nkeV peak in the X-ray background indicate a significant population of Compton\nthick sources which can explain some, but not all, of the change in the local\nblack hole mass density.

One of the reasons for this is that\nspin-imbalance frustrates the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) superfluid\npairing mechanism, in which fermions in different spin states combine into\nCooper pairs with zero momentum. In 1964, it was proposed that an exotic\nsuperfluid state called the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state, in\nwhich the Cooper pairs have nonzero momentum, could exist in a spin-imbalanced\nFermi gas. At the saddle-point (mean field) level, it has been shown that the\nFFLO state only occupies a very small sliver in the ground state phase diagram\nof a 3D Fermi gas. However, a question that remains to be investigated is: what\nis the influence of phase fluctuations around the saddle point on the FFLO\nstate? In this work we show that phase fluctuations only lead to relatively\nsmall quantitative corrections to the presence of the FFLO state in the\nsaddle-point phase diagram of a 3D spin-imbalanced Fermi gas. Starting from the\npartition function of the system, we calculate the effective action within the\npath-integral adiabatic approximation. The action is then expanded up to second\norder in the fluctuation field around the saddle point, leading to the\nfluctuation free energy. Using this free energy, we calculate corrections due\nto phase fluctuations to the BCS-FFLO transition in the saddle-point phase\ndiagram. At temperatures at which the FFLO state exists, we find only small\ncorrections to the size of the FFLO area. Our results suggest that fluctuations\nof the phase of the FFLO order parameter, which can be interpreted as an\noscillation of its momentum vector, do not cause an instability of the FFLO\nstate with respect to the BCS state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Oct 2013 20:10:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

If a\nsquark is the LSP, it will have a short displaced vertex. If any other particle\nis the LSP, the displaced vertex is naturally expected to be quite long,\npossibly even outside the detectors.

This arises because this operator\nefficiently washes-out the baryon asymmetry in the early universe, unless the\nsquarks are heavy and the coupling is small. Avoiding displaced vertices is\npossible, but requires baryogenesis below the weak scale.

In most fMRI applications functional networks\nare assumed to be stationary, resulting in a single network estimated for the\nentire time course. However recent results suggest that the connectivity\nbetween brain regions is highly non-stationary even at rest. As a result, there\nis a need for new brain imaging methodologies that comprehensively account for\nthe dynamic (i.e., non-stationary) nature of the fMRI data. In this work we\npropose the Smooth Incremental Graphical Lasso Estimation (SINGLE) algorithm\nwhich estimates dynamic brain networks from fMRI data. We apply the SINGLE\nalgorithm to functional MRI data from 24 healthy patients performing a\nchoice-response task to demonstrate the dynamic changes in network structure\nthat accompany a simple but attentionally demanding cognitive task. Using graph\ntheoretic measures we show that the Right Inferior Frontal Gyrus, frequently\nreported as playing an important role in cognitive control, dynamically changes\nwith the task.

Existing tests based on quadratic\nforms such as the Wald statistic often suffer from low powers due to the\naccumulation of errors in estimating high-dimensional parameters. More powerful\ntests for sparse alternatives such as thresholding and extreme-value tests, on\nthe other hand, require either stringent conditions or bootstrap to derive the\nnull distribution and often suffer from size distortions due to the slow\nconvergence. Based on a screening technique, we introduce a \"power enhancement\ncomponent\", which is zero under the null hypothesis with high probability, but\ndiverges quickly under sparse alternatives. The proposed test statistic\ncombines the power enhancement component with an asymptotically pivotal\nstatistic, and strengthens the power under sparse alternatives. The null\ndistribution does not require stringent regularity conditions, and is\ncompletely determined by that of the pivotal statistic. As a byproduct, the\npower enhancement component also consistently identifies the elements that\nviolate the null hypothesis. As specific applications, the proposed methods are\napplied to testing the factor pricing models and validating the cross-sectional\nindependence in panel data models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Oct 2013 02:02:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 16 Aug 2014 18:55:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-19"}

Traditionally, it is\nassumed that the channel is noiseless. However, Maurer showed that in this case\nan attacker can succeed with probability $2^{-\\frac{H(K)}{\\ell+1}}$ after\nauthenticating $\\ell$ messages. In this paper, we consider the setting where\nthe channel is noisy. Specifically, Alice and Bob are connected by a discrete\nmemoryless channel (DMC) $W_1$ and a noiseless but insecure channel. In\naddition, an attacker Oscar is connected with Alice through DMC $W_2$ and with\nBob through a noiseless channel. In this setting, we study the framework that\nsends $M$ over the noiseless channel and the traditional MAC $f_K(M)$ over\nchannel $(W_1, W_2)$. We regard the noisy channel as an expensive resource and\ndefine the authentication rate $\\rho_{auth}$ as the ratio of message length to\nthe number $n$ of channel $W_1$ uses. The security of this framework depends on\nthe channel coding scheme for $f_K(M)$. A natural coding scheme is to use the\nsecrecy capacity achieving code of Csisz\\'{a}r and K\\\"{o}rner. Intuitively,\nthis is also the optimal strategy. However, we propose a coding scheme that\nachieves a higher $\\rho_{auth}.$ Our crucial point for this is that in the\nsecrecy capacity setting, Bob needs to recover $f_K(M)$ while in our coding\nscheme this is not necessary. How to detect the attack without recovering\n$f_K(M)$ is the main contribution of this work.

Around the same\ntime, we find a decreasing trend in the east-west asymmetry of the surface\nemissivity. These results could reflect the increasing interaction of the\nforward shock with material around the circumstellar ring, and the relative\nweakening of the interaction with the lower-density material at higher\nlatitudes. The morphological evolution caused an apparent break in the remnant\nexpansion measured with a torus model, from a velocity of 4600+150-200 km/s\nbetween day 4000 and 7000 to 2400+100-200 km/s after day 7000.

This is supported by\nour ring-only fits which show a constant expansion of 3890+/-50 km/s without\ndeceleration between days 4000 and 9000.

The efficient performance of photogalvanic cells relies on high dye\nsolubility and selective electrodes with fast electron transfer kinetics. A new\nconfiguration is proposed for the photogalvanic cells that removes these\nimpractical requirements. Instead of illuminating the device through the\nelectrode, as is the conventional approach, a new vertical configuration is\nemployed with light coming between the two electrodes. This way, the light\nabsorption and hence electron generation is spread through the depth of the\ndevice. As a result, unreasonably fast electrode kinetics are no longer\nrequired. The depth can be adjusted according to the concentration of the dyes,\nand thus deeper cells enable low solubility dyes to be employed. The proposed\nconfiguration is mathematically modeled and the advantages over the\nconventional cell are shown. A numerical model is built for more detailed\nanalysis that gives practical guidelines for working towards device parameters\nwith high power conversion efficiency. The analysis suggests that upon the\nrealization of highly selective electrodes and an improved dye/mediator couple,\nan efficiency of 13% should be achievable from the new configuration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Oct 2013 06:18:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 15 Mar 2014 02:21:29 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 15 Sep 2014 19:32:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-16"}

Our goal\nis to search for spectroscopic evidence of a compact companion around WR 138.\nMethods. We used optical and X-ray spectra to search for signatures of a\ncompact companion, which can be revealed by systematic variations in WR optical\nspectral lines induced by orbital motion of the compact companion or by hard,\nluminous X-rays from accretion onto this companion.

The aim of our work is to create a\ncoherent picture of this exotic object by using the new optical multicolor\nphotometric and spectroscopic observations at Apache Point Observatory as well\nas archival datasets from Gemini and wide-field surveys. We performed the\nMalin2 mass modelling, estimated the contribution of the host dark halo and\nfound that it had acquired its low central density and the huge isothermal\nsphere core radius before the disc subsystem was formed. Our spectroscopic data\nanalysis reveals complex kinematics of stars and gas in the very inner region.\nWe measured the oxygen abundance in several clumps and concluded that the gas\nmetallicity decreases from the solar value in the centre to a half of that at\n20-30 kpc. We found a small satellite and measured its mass (1/500 of the host\ngalaxy) and gas metallicity. One of the unique properties of Malin2 turned to\nbe the apparent imbalance of ISM: the molecular gas is in excess with respect\nto the atomic gas for given values of the gas equilibrium turbulent pressure.\nWe explain this imbalance by the presence of a significant portion of the dark\ngas not observable in CO and the Hi 21 cm lines. We also show that the\ndepletion time of the observed molecular gas traced by CO is nearly the same as\nin normal galaxies. Our modelling of the UV-to-optical spectral energy\ndistribution favours the exponentially declined SFH over a single-burst\nscenario. We argue that the massive and rarefied dark halo which had formed\nbefore the disc component well describes all the observed properties of Malin2\nand there is no need to assume additional catastrophic scenarios proposed\npreviously to explain the origin of giant LSB galaxies.

In this work, first the definition\nof Be stars is contrasted to similar classes, and common observables obtained\nfor Be stars are introduced and the respective formation mechanisms explained.\nWe then review the current state of knowledge concerning the central stars as\nnon-radially pulsating objects and non-magnetic stars, as far as it concerns\nlarge scale, i.e., mostly dipolar, global fields. Localized, weak magnetic\nfields remain possible, but are as of yet unproven. The Be phenomenon, linked\nwith one or more mass ejection processes, acts on top of a rotation rate of\nabout 75% of critical or above. The properties of the process can be well\nconstrained, leaving only few options, most importantly, but not exclusively,\nnon-radial pulsation and small scale magnetic fields. Of these, it is well\npossible that all are realized: In different stars, different processes may be\nacting. Once the material has been lifted into Keplerian orbit, memory of the\ndetails of the ejection process is lost, and the material is governed by\nviscosity. The disks are fairly well understood in the theoretical framework of\nthe viscous decretion disk model. This is not only true for the disk structure,\nbut as well for its variability, both cyclic and secular. Be binaries are\nreviewed under the aspect of the various types of interactions a companion can\nhave with the circumstellar disk.

Battery-operated sensors are\nseverely constrained by the amount of energy that can be spend for transmitting\nthese sensed data. However, aggregation of data (including removal of redundant\ndata) at intermediate sensors and forwarding of aggregate data reduce overall\nenergy consumptions in WSN. In general, data gathering refers to the process of\nperiodic collection of sensed data from various sensors to one or more base\nstations (BS). Energy efficient data gathering scheduling is essential for\nimproving the lifetime of WSN. In this paper, we propose a distributed\nalgorithm to compute data-gathering schedule that aim to improve the lifetime\nof WSN by suitably selecting energy-efficient data-flow paths from various\nsensors to the base station. For a multihop WSN with $n$ sensors, the proposed\nalgorithm first computes a schedule in $O(n^2)$ time steps, and then this\nschedule is periodically updated based the residual energy and the feedback\nreceived from the BS. The system performs approximately $\\log(\\mathcal{L})$\nschedule updates where $\\mathcal{L}$ is the expected lifetime of the system in\nnumber of data-gathering rounds. Moreover, each updation process uses the\nexisting active schedule (data-flow path) - thus consuming only a small\nfraction of a single data gathering round activity. Such an algorithm thus\ncould precisely incorporate the energy consumptions due to updates and related\nactivities. Moreover, our algorithm does not assume any global knowledge of the\ntopology or the positions of various sensors. Through simulation study, we\nfound that our proposed algorithm achieves significantly higher network\nlifetime compared to existing data-flow schedules based on the Minimum Spanning\nTree (MST), the Shortest Path Tree (SPT), the Weighted Rooted Tree (WRT).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Oct 2013 10:25:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-16"}

We\nreduced a large set of archive data from the Very Large Array (VLA) to\ndetermine the radio light curve of 9 Sgr at 2, 3.6, 6 and 20 cm. We also\nconstructed a simple model that solves the radiative transfer in the\ncolliding-wind region and both stellar winds. The 2-cm radio flux shows clear\nphase-locked variability with the orbit. The behaviour at other wavelengths is\nless clear, mainly due to a lack of observations centred on 9 Sgr around\nperiastron passage. The high fluxes and nearly flat spectral shape of the radio\nemission show that synchrotron radiation dominates the radio light curve at all\norbital phases. The model provides a good fit to the 2-cm observations,\nallowing us to estimate that the brightness temperature of the synchrotron\nradiation emitted in the colliding-wind region at 2 cm is at least 4 x 10^8 K.\nThe simple model used here already allows us to derive important information\nabout the colliding-wind region.

This\nmodel is however currently, and actually in principle, unable to predict the\ngravitational field of a galaxy from it observed baryons alone. Indeed the\ngravitational field should depend on the relative contribution of the particle\ndark matter distribution to the baryonic one, itself depending on the\nindividual assembly history and environment of the galaxy, including a lot of\ncomplex feedback mechanisms.

The terminal state,\nthat is reached when all nodes have been split, is a dense configuration of\nself-avoiding walks on the diamond network. Starting from the crystallographic\ndiamond network, each of the four-coordinated nodes is replaced with\nprobability p by a pair of two edges, each connecting a pair of the adjacent\nvertices. For all values of 0 <= p <= 1 the network percolates, yet the\nfraction fp of the system that belongs to a percolating cluster drops sharply\nat pc=1 to a finite value. This transition has the signature of a phase\ntransition with scaling exponents for p close to pc that are different from the\ncritical exponents of the second-order phase transition of standard percolation\nmodels. As is the case for percolation transitions, this transition\nsignificantly affects the mechanical properties of linear-elastic realisations,\nobtained by replacing edges with solid circular struts to give an effective\ndensity phi. Finite element methods demonstrate that, as a low-density cellular\nstructure, the bulk modulus K shows a cross-over from a compression-dominated\nbehaviour (with K proportional to phi) at p=0 to a bending-dominated behaviour\n(with quadratic dependence of K on phi) at p=1.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Oct 2013 11:51:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-16"}

In this approach,\nmotivated by recent work on quantization, the complexified Hamiltonian flows\nact, through the Grobner theory of Lie series, on the sheaf of complex valued\nreal analytic functions, changing the sheaves of holomorphic functions. This\ndefines an action on the space of (equivalent) complex structures on M and also\na direct action on M. This description is related to the approach of [BLU]\nwhere one has an action on a complexification M_C of M followed by projection\nto M. Our approach allows for the study of some Hamiltonian functions which are\nnot real analytic. It also leads naturally to the consideration of continuous\ndegenerations of diffeomorphisms and of Kahler structures of M. Hence, one can\nlink continuously (geometric quantization) real, and more general non-Kahler,\npolarizations with Kahler polarizations. This corresponds to the extension of\nthe geodesics to the boundary of the space of Kahler metrics. Three\nillustrative examples are considered. We find an explicit formula for the\ncomplex time evolution of the Kahler potential under the flow. For integral\nsymplectic forms, this formula corresponds to the complexification of the\nprequantization of Hamiltonian symplectomorphisms.

The sensitivity limit of a\nfuture experiment with existing detectors geometry has been estimated for the\ncase of zero background limit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Oct 2013 15:49:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-16"}

Hence, in\nstudies of time-reversal asymmetry the mapping $t\\mapsto -t$ is naturally\nassociated with $z\\mapsto -z$. However, strongly non-reciprocal or one-way\nnano-scale threads can be used \\emph{to weave meta-surfaces} thus adding\ndimensions to this concept.

Simple mathematical models of a\nflexible beam immersed in a two-dimensional flow will also exhibit this\nbehavior. What is less understood is how the mechanical properties of a leaf in\na three-dimensional flow will passively allow roll up into a cone shape and\nreduce both drag and vortex induced oscillations. In this fluid dynamics video,\nthe flows around the leaves are compared with those of simplified sheets using\n3D numerical simulations and physical models. For some reconfiguration shapes,\nlarge forces and oscillations due to strong vortex shedding are produced. In\nthe actual leaf, a stable recirculation zone is formed within the wake of the\nreconfigured cone. In physical and numerical models that reconfigure into\ncones, a similar recirculation zone is observed with both rigid and flexible\ntethers. These results suggest that the three-dimensional cone structure in\naddition to flexibility is significant to both the reduction of vortex-induced\nvibrations and the forces experienced by the leaf.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Oct 2013 05:10:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-22"}
