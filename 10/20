In this paper\nwe consider a variant, called the \\emph{discrete Fr\\'echet distance with\nshortcuts}, which captures the similarity between (sampled) curves in the\npresence of outliers. For the \\emph{two-sided} case, where shortcuts are\nallowed in both curves, we give an $O((m^{2/3}n^{2/3}+m+n)\\log^3 (m+n))$-time\nalgorithm for computing this distance. When shortcuts are allowed only in one\nnoise-containing curve, we give an even faster randomized algorithm that runs\nin $O((m+n)^{6/5+\\varepsilon})$ expected time, for any $\\varepsilon>0$.\n  Our techniques are novel and may find further applications. One of the main\nnew technical results is: Given two sets of points $A$ and $B$ and an interval\n$I$, we develop an algorithm that decides whether the number of pairs $(x,y)\\in\nA\\times B$ whose distance ${\\rm dist}(x,y)$ is in $I$, is less than some given\nthreshold $L$. The running time of this algorithm decreases as $L$ increases.\nIn case there are more than $L$ pairs of points whose distance is in $I$, we\ncan get a small sample of pairs that contains a pair at approximate median\ndistance (i.e., we can approximately \"bisect\" $I$). We combine this procedure\nwith additional ideas to search, with a small overhead, for the optimal\none-sided Fr\\'echet distance with shortcuts, using a very fast decision\nprocedure.

For\nsmall systems ($L<\\lambda$), the transition is associated with the Standard\nStochastic Resonance regime, while, for large systems ($L>\\lambda$), the\ntransition is driven by Anomalous Stochastic Resonance. The origin of the\nlatter is identified as due to the emergence of an additional relevant\nlengthscale, namely the roughness of the spin domain switching interface. The\ndistinction between different stochastic resonance regimes is discussed at\nlength, both qualitatively by means of snapshot configurations, as well as\nquantitatively via residence-length and order-parameter probability\ndistributions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Oct 2013 18:41:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-05"}

For 2 qubits, we show that with a few points subtracted, this\nhypersurface is a simply-connected 9-dimensional manifold embedded in a\n15-dimensional background space. \\ We do this by constructing an explicit\\\nhomeomorphism from a known manifold to the subtracted version of $\\mathcal{C}\n$.

We establish that\nseveral of the clearest cases of charge ordering transitions involve no\ndisproportion (no charge transfer between the cations, hence no charge\ntransfer), and that the experimental data used to support charge ordering can\nbe accounted for within density functional based calculations that contain no\ncharge transfer between cations. We propose that the charge state picture\nretains meaning and importance, at least inn many cases, if one focuses on\nWannier functions rather than atomic orbitals. The challenge of modeling charge\nordering transitions with model Hamiltonians is discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Oct 2013 03:57:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-25"}

In general, the\noverall trends are covered by the non-linear, baryonic evolution, whose\nfeedback mechanisms tend to randomize the gas behaviour and homogenize its\nstatistical features, quite independently from the background matter\ndistribution. Deviations due to non-Gaussianity are almost undistinguishable\nfor $f_{\\rm NL}\\lesssim 100$, remaining always at few-per-cent level, within\nthe error bars of the Gaussian scenario. Rather extreme models with $f_{\\rm\nNL}\\sim1000$ present more substantial deviations from the Gaussian case,\novercoming baryon contaminations and showing discrepancies up to a factor of a\nfew in the spectral properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Oct 2013 10:52:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

This\nresearch field provides rich new insights that could not be obtained from the\nstudy of equilibrium situations, and the theoretical understanding of the\nphysics often requires the development of new concepts and methods. On the\nexperimental side, ultra-fast pump-probe spectroscopies enable studies of\nexcitation and relaxation phenomena in correlated electron systems, while\nultra-cold atoms in optical lattices provide a new way to control and measure\nthe time-evolution of interacting lattice systems with a vastly different\ncharacteristic timescale compared to electron systems. A theoretical\ndescription of these phenomena is challenging because, firstly, we have to\ncompute the quantum-mechanical time-evolution of many-body systems out of\nequilibrium, and secondly, deal with strong-correlation effects which can be of\nnonperturbative nature. In this review, we discuss the nonequilibrium extension\nof the dynamical mean field theory (DMFT), which treats quantum fluctuations in\nthe time domain and works directly in the thermodynamic limit. The method\nreduces the complexity of the calculation via a mapping to a self-consistent\nimpurity problem.

It\nis a Lorentz-violating theory, and gained much attention in the recent years.\nIn the present work, we study the cosmological evolution of Einstein-Aether\nmodels with power-law-like potential, by using the method of dynamical system.\nIn the case without matter, there are two attractors which correspond to an\ninflationary universe in the early epoch, or a de Sitter universe in the late\ntime. In the case with matter but there is no interaction between dark energy\nand matter, there are only two de Sitter attractors, and no scaling attractor\nexists. So, it is difficult to alleviate the cosmological coincidence problem.\nTherefore, we then allow the interaction between dark energy and matter. In\nthis case, several scaling attractors can exist under some complicated\nconditions, and hence the cosmological coincidence problem could be alleviated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Oct 2013 15:19:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 Mar 2014 10:23:17 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 15 Apr 2014 10:10:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-16"}

The answer is that such an embedding is very difficult and rare but not\nimpossible. Indeed we were able to find two examples of integrable models\nembedded in Supergravity in this way. Both examples are fitted into N=1\nSupergravity by means of a very specific and interesting choice of the\nsuperpotential W(z). The question whether there are examples of such an\nembedding in extended Gauged Supergravity remains open. In the present paper,\nrelying on the embedding tensor formalism we classified all gaugings of the N=2\nSTU model, confirming, in the absence on hypermultiplets, the uniqueness of the\nstable de Sitter vacuum found several years ago by Fre, Trigiante and Van\nProeyen and excluding the embedding of any integrable cosmological model. A\ndetailed analysis of the space of exact solutions of the first Supergravity\nembedded integrable cosmological model revealed several new features worth an\nin depth consideration. When the scalar potential has an extremum at a negative\nvalue, the universe necessarily collapses into a Big Crunch notwithstanding its\nspatial flatness. The causal structure of these universes is quite different\nfrom that of the closed, positive curved, universe: indeed in this case the\nparticle and event horizons do not coincide and develop complicated patterns.\nThe cosmological consequences of this unexpected mechanism deserve careful\nconsideration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Oct 2013 15:25:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

A well known example of this\nproblem is the doping of Cu$_2$O. The only element which has produced an order\nof magnitude increase in the conductivity of Cu$_2$O bulk samples is chlorine,\nas previously reported by us and others. However the solar cells produced with\nthis material do not show any improvement in performances because of the\nreduction in the minority carrier diffusion length. In this paper we\ninvestigate the effect of other impurities in order to check their possible use\nas dopants and to assess their effects on the minority carrier diffusion\nlength. Seven impurities have been introduced by evaporation on the starting\ncopper sheet before the oxidation used to produce Cu$_2$O: chromium (Cr), iron\n(Fe), silver (Ag), silicon (Si), sodium (Na), sulfur (S) and phosphorus (P).\nThe experiments show that a 20 ppm of concentration of these dopants does not\ngive any relevant effect neither on the resistivity, nor on the mobility. The\neffect on minority carrier diffusion length is also negligible except for\nsodium which produces a slight degradation of the samples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Oct 2013 15:30:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-22"}

In order to obtain this we use the Smaller\nALingment Index (SALI) technique integrating extensive samples of orbits. Of\nparticular interest is the study of distant, remote stars moving in large\ngalactocentric orbits. Our extensive numerical experiments indicate that the\nmajority of the distant stars perform chaotic orbits. However, there are also\ndistant stars displaying regular motion as well. Most distant stars are ejected\ninto the galactic halo on approaching the dense and massive nucleus. We study\nthe influence of some important parameters of the dynamical system, such as the\nmass of the nucleus and the angular momentum, by computing in each case the\npercentage of regular and chaotic orbits. A second order polynomial\nrelationship connects the mass of the nucleus and the critical angular momentum\nof the distant star. Some heuristic semi-theoretical arguments to explain and\njustify the numerically derived outcomes are also given. Our numerical\ncalculations suggest that the majority of distant stars spend their orbital\ntime in the halo where it is easy to be observed. We present evidence that the\nmain cause for driving stars to distant orbits is the presence of the dense\nnucleus combined with the perturbation caused by nearby galaxies. The origin of\nyoung O and B stars observed in the halo is also discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Oct 2013 07:09:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 9 Feb 2014 10:45:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-11"}

Instead of working with Young tableaux\ndirectly, we introduce a vector notation (sequences of these vectors represent\n(\"single-vote\") ballot sequences in the case of SYT, and \"multi-vote\" ballot\nsequences--where the voter may choose any number of candidates--in the case of\nSSYT) to aid in the inductive argument. Next, we establish an identity which\nallows us to prove a formula that counts multi-vote ballot sequences. We\ndemonstrate that, in the non-degenerate case (when this formula counts SSYTs)\nit coincides with the HCF. To do the latter, we borrow parts of a technique\noutlined by Wilson and Van Lint in their proof of the HLF. We then establish an\nidentity, which is really a special case of the equation mentioned above, and\nshow that the HLF follows from it. (Wilson and Van Lint prove this identity\ndirectly, and use it to prove the HLF in a similar manner.)
