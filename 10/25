We discuss three main findings:\n(1) A subset of the sources have consistent magnetic field (B-field)\norientations between large (~20\") and small (~2.5\") scales. Those same sources\nalso tend to have higher fractional polarizations than the sources with\ninconsistent large-to-small-scale fields. We interpret this to mean that in at\nleast some cases B-fields play a role in regulating the infall of material all\nthe way down to the ~1000 AU scales of protostellar envelopes. (2) Outflows\nappear to be randomly aligned with B-fields; although, in sources with low\npolarization fractions there is a hint that outflows are preferentially\nperpendicular to small-scale B-fields, which suggests that in these sources the\nfields have been wrapped up by envelope rotation. (3) Finally, even at ~2.5\"\nresolution we see the so-called \"polarization hole\" effect, where the\nfractional polarization drops significantly near the total intensity peak.

As, quantum mechanically, the radiation is\na mixture of pure states, it should be possible to measure the temporal\ncoherence of the states as a function of energy. We propose here experiments\nwith just this possibility, showing the empirical grounds on which it is based.\nA simple means of measuring temporal coherence is with the extent of the\ninterference pattern produced in a Young's double-slit experiment. Thus, we\npropose the use of such an experiment, but with a screen of energy measuring\nphoton detectors, small enough and sensitive enough to delineate the\ninterference patterns according to photon energy. We then only register a\ndetection if the absorbed photon is found to have the energy of interest. In\nthis way, we have allowed the interference, i.e., the wave aspect of the\nexperiment, to proceed as normal, recovering the interference pattern by\naccumulating just those registered detections. We, also, explain why this form\nof filtering does not actually violate the conventional wisdom that, when using\nan optical filter with incident continuum radiation to separate out the photons\nof a particular energy, only the temporal coherence of the filter's passband\nwould be measured. It naturally then introduces the concept of a detections\nfilter, differentiating it from an optical filter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Oct 2013 16:35:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Jul 2014 14:55:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 6 Oct 2015 22:15:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-08"}

Further, we show that for all $n$, there exists a triangle-free\ngraph with $n$ vertices which has at most $e^{(c_2+o(1))\\sqrt{n}\\ln n}$\nindependent sets, where $c_2 = 1+\\ln 2 = 1.693147..$. This disproves a\nconjecture from \\cite{countingind}.\n  Let $H$ be a $(k+1)$-uniform linear hypergraph with $n$ vertices and average\ndegree $t$. We also show that there exists a constant $c_k$ such that the\nnumber of independent sets in $H$ is at least \\[ e^{c_{k}\n\\frac{n}{t^{1/k}}\\ln^{1+1/k}{t}}. \\] This is tight apart from the constant\n$c_k$ and generalizes a result of Duke, Lefmann, and R\\\"odl\n\\cite{uncrowdedrodl}, which guarantees the existence of an independent set of\nsize $\\Omega(\\frac{n}{t^{1/k}} \\ln^{1/k}t)$. Both of our lower bounds follow\nfrom a more general statement, which applies to hereditary properties of\nhypergraphs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Oct 2013 16:57:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 25 Oct 2013 16:01:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-20"}

We establish that the coupling (g) of heavy\nKaluza-Klein modes to light states scales as ${M_{KK} / M_{Pl}}$ (hence is\nsuppressed by two third powers of the inverse volume of compactification) and\nargue that consistency of the superspace derivative expansion requires $gF/M^2\n\\sim m_{3/2}/ M_{KK} << 1$, where $F$ is the auxiliary field of the light\nfields and $M$ the ultraviolet cutoff. This gives only a mild constraint on the\nflux superpotential, $W_{flux} << V^{1/3}$ (where V is the volume of the\ncompactification), which can be easily satisfied for order one values of\n$W_{flux}$.

The geometry dependence\nof the correlation function leads to stronger azimuthal near- and away-side\ncorrelations in the tip-on-tip U+U collisions than in the side-on-side U+U\ncollisions, an exactly opposite behavior from the correlations generated by the\nelliptic flow of the quark-gluon plasma: a study of azimuthal correlations in\nthe U+U collisions may thus help to disentangle the two sources of\ncorrelations.\n  We demonstrate that the cross section for two-gluon production in heavy-light\nion collisions contains a power-law infrared (IR) divergence even for fixed\nproduced gluon momenta: while saturation effects in the target regulate some of\nthe power-law IR-divergent terms in the lowest-order expression for the\ntwo-gluon correlator, other power-law IR-divergent terms remain, possibly due\nto absence of saturation effects in the dilute projectile.

Half of the ELVIS galaxy\nhalos are in paired configurations similar to the Milky Way (MW) and M31; the\nother half are isolated, mass-matched analogs. We find no difference in the\nabundance or kinematics of substructure within the virial radii of isolated\nversus paired hosts. On Mpc scales, however, LG-like pairs average almost twice\nas many companions and the velocity field is kinematically hotter and more\ncomplex. We present a refined abundance matching relation between stellar mass\nand halo mass that reproduces the observed satellite stellar mass functions of\nthe MW and M31 down to the regime where incompleteness is an issue, $M_\\star\n\\sim 5\\times 10^5 \\, M_\\odot$. Within a larger region spanning approximately 3\nMpc, the same relation predicts that there should be $\\sim$ 1000 galaxies with\n$M_\\star > 10^{3}\\,M_\\odot$ awaiting discovery. We show that up to 50% of halos\nwithin 1 Mpc of the MW or M31 could be systems that have previously been within\nthe virial radius of either giant. By associating never-accreted halos with\ngas-rich dwarfs, we show that there are plausibly 50 undiscovered dwarf\ngalaxies with HI masses $> 10^5\\,M_\\odot$ within the Local Volume. The radial\nvelocity distribution of these predicted gas-rich dwarfs can be used to inform\nfollow-up searches based on ultra-compact high-velocity clouds found in the\nALFALFA survey.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Oct 2013 20:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Oct 2013 17:47:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 15 Jan 2014 01:21:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-16"}

In\nparticular, we present new measurements of the galaxy two-point correlation\nfunction and the galaxy-galaxy lensing signal as a function of M* and g-r color\nfrom the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, and show that age matching exhibits\nremarkable agreement with these and other statistics of low-redshift galaxies.\nIn so doing, we also demonstrate good agreement between the galaxy-galaxy\nlensing observed by SDSS and the signal predicted by abundance matching, a new\nsuccess of this model.

The striking success of our simple implementation of CAM\nprovides compelling evidence that this technique has the potential to describe\nthe same set of data as alternative models, but with a dramatic reduction in\nthe required number of parameters.

However, it remains unclear how an\nMFR evolves into and forms the multi-component structure of a CME. In this\npaper, we perform a comprehensive study of an extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) MFR\neruption on 2013 May 22 by tracking its morphological evolution, studying its\nkinematics, and quantifying its thermal property. As EUV brightenings begin,\nthe MFR starts to rise slowly and shows helical threads winding around an axis.\nMeanwhile, cool filamentary materials descend spirally down to the\nchromosphere. These features provide direct observational evidence of\nintrinsically helical structure of the MFR. Through detailed kinematical\nanalysis, we find that the MFR evolution experiences two distinct phases: a\nslow rise phase and an impulsive acceleration phase. We attribute the first\nphase to the magnetic reconnection within the quasi-separatrix-layers\nsurrounding the MFR, and the much more energetic second phase to the fast\nmagnetic reconnection underneath the MFR. We suggest that the transition\nbetween these two phases be caused by the torus instability. Moreover, we\nidentify that the MFR evolves smoothly into the outer corona and appears as a\ncoherent structure within the white light CME volume. The MFR in the outer\ncorona was enveloped by bright fronts that originated from plasma pile-up in\nfront of the expanding MFR. The fronts are also associated with the preceding\nsheath region followed the outmost MFR-driven shock.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Oct 2013 21:51:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

The transition separates regions having two distinct STZ characteristics.\nSpecifically, at high temperatures and high strain rates, we show that the STZs\nhave characteristics identical to those that emerge from purely strain-driven,\nathermal quasistatic atomistic calculations. At lower temperatures and\nexperimentally relevant strain rates, we use the newly coupled PES + shear\ndeformation method to show that the STZs have characteristics identical to\nthose that emerge from a purely thermally activated state. The specific changes\nin STZ characteristics that occur in moving from the strain-driven to thermally\nactivated STZ regime include a 33% increase in STZ size, faster spatial decay\nof the displacement field, a change in the deformation mechanism inside the STZ\nfrom shear to tension, a reduction in the stress needed to nucleate the first\nSTZ, and finally a notable loss in characteristic quadrupolar symmetry of the\nsurrounding elastic matrix that has previously been seen in athermal,\nquasistatic shear studies of STZs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Oct 2013 04:09:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-29"}

We find the signature of periodic oscillations\nlocalized in the decay phase of the flare in its soft (0.3-10.0 keV) X-ray\nemissions. Using the standard wavelet tool, we find the multiple periodicities\nof 1261 s and 687 s. These bursty oscillations persist for durations of 90\nminutes and 50 minutes, respectively, for more than 4 cycles. The intensity\noscillations with the period of 1261 s may be the signature of the fundamental\nmode of slow magnetoacoustic waves with the phase-speed of 119 km s$^{-1}$ in\nthe loop of the length 7.5$\\times 10^{9}$ cm heated initially to obtain the\nflare peak temperature of 33 MK and later cooled down in the decay phase\nmaintained at the average temperature of 7.2 MK. The other period of 687 s may\nbe associated with the first overtone of slow magnetoacoustic oscillations in\nthe flaring loop. The fundamental mode oscillations show a dissipation with\ndamping time of 47 min. The period ratio P$_{1}$/P$_{2}$ is found to be 1.83\nindicating that such oscillations are most likely excited in longitudinal\ndensity stratified stellar loops. We estimate the density scale height of\nstellar loop system as 22.6 Mm, which is smaller than the hydrostatic scale\nheight of the hot loop system, and implies the existence of non-equilibrium\nconditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Oct 2013 07:17:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

Furthermore, the cylinder\nhad a pore along the axis but were closed at one end. This unique phenomenon of\nself assembly of {\\em monodisperse} CdS nano-cylinders had been observed in a\nrather simple experiment where two chambers containing 0.1 M ${\\rm Cd Cl_2}$\nand 0.1 M ${\\rm Na_2 S}$ solutions were joined by an array of anodized\naluminium oxide (AAO) nano-channels [A.

In\nthis communication, we identify factors affecting the self-assembly process for\nnano-tubes growing out an array of closely spaced AAO nano-channel exits. Our\nmodel is not $Cd^{+2}$ or $S^{2-}$ specific, the experimental scheme can be\nextended to self assemble a general class of reacting-diffusing A and B ions\nwith A (${\\rm Cd^{+2}}$) selectively migrating out from a nano-channel. In\nparticular, we note that after the initial prolonged growth of nanotubes, there\ncan arise a severe deficiency of B-ions (${\\rm S^{-2}}$) ions near the\nAAO-nano-channel exits, the points where the reaction and aggregation occurs to\nform the $CdS$ nanotube, thus impeding further growth of uniform CdS\nnano-tubes. Thereby we predict the necessary characteristics of reacting\nsystems which can be self assembled using suitable adaptations of previous\nexperiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Oct 2013 07:39:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-28"}

The procedure is based on a tight integration of IC3\nwith Implicit (predicate) Abstraction, a technique that expresses abstract\ntran- sitions without computing explicitly the abstract system and is\nincremental with respect to the addition of predicates. In this scenario, IC3\noperates only at the Boolean level of the abstract state space, discovering\ninductive clauses over the abstraction predicates. Theory reasoning is confined\nwithin the underlying SMT solver, and applied transparently when performing\nsatisfiability checks. When the current abstraction allows for a spurious\ncounterexample, it is refined by discov- ering and adding a sufficient set of\nnew predicates. Importantly, this can be done in a completely incremental\nmanner, without discarding the clauses found in the previous search. The\nproposed approach has two key advantages. First, unlike current SMT gener-\nalizations of IC3, it allows to handle a wide range of background theories\nwithout relying on ad-hoc extensions, such as quantifier elimination or\ntheory-specific clause generalization procedures, which might not always be\navailable, and can moreover be inefficient. Second, compared to a direct\nexploration of the concrete transition system, the use of abstraction gives a\nsignificant performance improve- ment, as our experiments demonstrate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Oct 2013 08:15:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-28"}

This\napproach shows that, as the radius of a fibril with constant double-twist\nincreases, the periodic layered organization can not be preserved without\nmoving from planar to helicoidal configurations. Such changes of configurations\nare indeed made possible by the edge dislocations naturally present in the\nphyllotactic pattern where their distribution is such that the lateral growth\nof a fibril should stay limited in the observed range. Because of our limited\nknowledge about the elastic constants involved, this purely geometrical\ndevelopment stays at a quite conjectural level.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Oct 2013 08:51:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-28"}

The present thesis explores the behaviour\nof sequences of rational two-dimensional CFTs when the central charge\napproaches its supremum. After a review of various notions useful to study\nlimit theories, like the concept of averaged fields and the construction of\ncontinuous orbifolds, we analyse in detail the limit of sequences of N=2\nsupersymmetric CFTs that are connected by RG flows. The limit is not unique,\nsince with extended Virasoro symmetry one can choose different scalings for the\nlabels of the spectrum in the limit. We construct explicitly two c=3 CFTs\nemerging as the large level limit of minimal models, and we identify both of\nthem: one is the N=2 CFT of two uncompactified free real bosons and two free\nreal fermions, the other is its continuous orbifold by U(1). We compare\nspectrum, torus partition function, correlators and boundary conditions. The\nneatest interpretation of this result is given by studying the realisation of\nN=2 minimal models as gauged WZW models: taking the two different limits\namounts to zooming into two different regions of the target-space geometry.

However, HII\nregions associated with recent star-formation may not have abundances typical\nfor the galaxy as a whole and it is believed that the bulk of the metals may be\ncontained in the neutral gas. It is therefore important to directly probe the\nmetal abundances in the neutral gas, which can be done by using absorption\nlines imprinted on a background quasar. Recently, we have presented studies of\nthe stellar content of a small sample of such quasar absorbers with HI column\ndensities measured to be in the sub-Damped Lyman-alpha to Damped Lyman-alpha\nrange. Here, we present observations covering 300 nm to 2.5 microns of emission\nline spectra of three of these absorbing-galaxies using the long-slit\nspectrograph X-Shooter on the VLT. This allows us to compare the neutral and\nionised phase metallicities in the same objects and relates these measures to\npossible signature of low-metallicity gas accretion or outflows of gas enriched\nby star formation. Our results suggest that the abundances derived in\nabsorption along the line-of-sight to background quasars are reliable measures\nof the overall galaxy metallicities. In addition to a comparison of abundances\nin different phases of the gas, a potential observational consequence of\ndifferences in fueling mechanisms for disc galaxies is the internal\ndistribution of their chemical abundances. We present some evidence for small\nnegative metallicity gradients in the three systems. The flat slopes are in\nline with the differences observed between the two phases of the gas. These\nresults suggest that a comparison of the HI and HII metallicities is a robust\nindicator of abundance gradients in high-redshift galaxies and do not favour\nthe presence of infall of fresh gas in these objects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Oct 2013 09:54:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-22"}

Volumetric\nparameterization is typically helpful in solving complicated geometric problems\npertaining to shape matching, morphing, path planning of robots, and\nisogeometric analysis etc. A novel method is proposed in which a volume\nparameterization is developed by mapping a general non-convex (genus-0) domain\nto its topologically equivalent convex domain. In order to achieve a continuous\nand bijective mapping of a domain, first we use the harmonic function to\nestablish a potential field over the domain. The gradients of the potential\nvalues are used to track the streamlines which originate from the boundary and\nconverge to a single point, referred to as the shape center. Each streamline\napproaches the shape center at a unique polar angle and an azimuthal angle .\nOnce all the three parameters (potential value, polar angle, azimuthal angle)\nnecessary to represent any point in the given domain are available, the domain\nis said to be parameterized.

However, spiking neurons will always be more expensive\nto simulate compared to rate neurons because of the inherent disparity in time\nscales - the spike duration time is much shorter than the inter-spike time,\nwhich is much shorter than any learning time scale. In numerical analysis, this\nis a classic stiff problem. Spiking neurons are also much more difficult to\nstudy analytically. One possible approach to making spiking networks more\ntractable is to augment mean field activity models with some information about\nspiking correlations. For example, such a generalized activity model could\ncarry information about spiking rates and correlations between spikes\nself-consistently. Here, we will show how this can be accomplished by\nconstructing a complete formal probabilistic description of the network and\nthen expanding around a small parameter such as the inverse of the number of\nneurons in the network.

When the parton density becomes close to a value of order\n$1/\\alpha_s$, it does not grow any longer, it saturates. These high density\neffects seem to be well described by the Color Glass Condensate effective field\ntheory. On the experimental side, the LHC provides the best tool ever for\nreaching the saturated phase of hadronic matter. For this reason saturation\nphysics is a very active branch of QCD during these past and coming years since\nsaturation theories and experimental data can be compared. I first deal with\nthe phenomenology of the proton-lead collisions performed in winter 2013 at the\nLHC and whose data are about to be available. I compute the di-gluon production\ncross-section which provides the simplest observable for finding quantitative\nevidences of saturation in the kinematic range of the LHC. I also discuss the\nlimit of the strongly correlated final state at large transverse momenta and by\nthe way, generalize parton distribution to dense regime. The second main topic\nis the quantum evolution of the quark and gluon spectra in nucleus-nucleus\ncollisions having in mind the proof of its universal character. This result is\nalready known for gluons and here I detail the calculation carefully. For\nquarks universality has not been proved yet but I derive an intermediate\nleading order to next-to leading order recursion relation which is a crucial\nstep for extracting the quantum evolution.

To determine this observationally, it is necessary\nto observe large numbers of extremely metal-poor stars. We present here the\nTurn-Off Primordial Stars survey (TOPoS) that is conducted as an ESO Large\nProgramme at the VLT. This project has {four} main goals: (i) to understand the\nformation of low-mass stars in a low-metallicity gas: determine the metal-weak\ntail of the halo MDF below [M/H]=-3.5. In particular, we aim at determining the\ncritical metallicity, that is the lowest metallicity sufficient for the\nformation of low-mass stars; (ii) to determine the relative abundance of the\nelements in extremely metal-poor stars, which are the signature of the massive\nfirst stars; (iii) to determine the trend of the lithium abundance at the time\nwhen the Galaxy formed; and (iv) to derive the fraction of C-enhanced extremely\nmetal-poor stars with respect to normal extremely metal-poor stars. The large\nnumber of stars observed in the SDSS provides a good sample of candidates of\nstars at extremely low metallicity. Candidates with turn-off colours down to\nmagnitude g=20 were selected from the low-resolution spectra of SDSS by means\nof an automated procedure. X-Shooter has the potential of performing the\nnecessary follow-up spectroscopy, providing accurate metallicities and\nabundance ratios for several key elements for these stars. We here present the\nstellar parameters of the first set of stars. The nineteen stars range in iron\nabundance between -4.1 and -2.9 dex relative to the Sun. Two stars have a high\nradial velocity and, according to our estimate of their kinematics, appear to\nbe marginally bound to the Galaxy and are possibly accreted from another\ngalaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Oct 2013 15:47:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

This is the case of the High Energy Peaked BL Lac (HBL) objects\nshowing strong variability in X-rays, which highly correlate with that of the\nTeV emission. The degree of this correlation is still debated, particularly\nwhen the flaring activity is followed down to very short time scales. This\ncorrelation could challenge the synchrotron-self-Compton scenario in which one\nrelativistic electron population dominates the entire radiative output. We\nargue that the LOFT Large Area Detector (10 m$^2$, LAD), thanks to its\nunprecedented timing capability, will allow us to detect the X-ray counterpart\n(2-50 keV) of the very fast variability observed at TeV energies, sheding light\non the nature of X-TeV connection. We will discuss the test case of PKS\n2155-304, showing as it would be possible to look for any X-ray variability\noccurring at very short timescales, never explored so far. This will put strong\nconstraints on the size and the location of any additional electron population\nin the multi-zone scenario. Under this perspective, LOFT and the CTA\nobservatories, planned to operate in the same time frame, will allow us to\ninvestigate in depth the connection between X-ray and TeV emissions. We also\ndiscuss the potentialities of LOFT in measuring the change in spectral\ncurvature of the synchrotron spectra in HBLs which will make possible to\ndirectly study the mechanism of acceleration of highly energetic electrons.\nLOFT timing capability will be also promising in the study of Flat Spectrum\nRadio Quasars (FSRQs) with flux $\\ge 1$ mCrab. Constraints to the location of\nthe high energy emission will be given by temporal investigation on second\ntimescale and spectral trend analysis on minute timescales. This represents a\nfurther link with CTA because of the rapid (unexpected) TeV emission recently\ndetected in some FSRQs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Oct 2013 15:53:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

In many cases symmetry patterns can emerge in these\nnetworks, as a consequence a part of the system might repeat itself, and\nproperties of this subsystem are representative of the dynamics on the whole\nphase space. In this paper an analysis of the second order N-node time-delay\nfully connected network is presented which is based on previous work by Correa\nand Piqueira \\cite{Correa2013} for a 2-node network. This study is carried out\nusing symmetry groups. We show the existence of multiple eigenvalues forced by\nsymmetry, as well as the existence of Hopf bifurcations. Three different models\nare used to analyze the network dynamics, namely, the full-phase, the phase,\nand the phase-difference model. We determine a finite set of frequencies\n$\\omega$, that might correspond to Hopf bifurcations in each case for critical\nvalues of the delay. The $S_n$ map is used to actually find Hopf bifurcations\nalong with numerical calculations using the Lambert W function. Numerical\nsimulations are used in order to confirm the analytical results. Although we\nrestrict attention to second order nodes, the results could be extended to\nhigher order networks provided the time-delay in the connections between nodes\nremains equal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Oct 2013 23:21:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 30 Oct 2013 18:07:40 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 20 Dec 2013 14:55:39 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 22 Jan 2014 17:24:30 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 21 Feb 2014 17:44:22 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Wed, 30 Jul 2014 18:49:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-31"}
