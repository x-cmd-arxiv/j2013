Our systematic analysis of the different regimes of this\nmodel reveals both universal features and distinct characteristics in the\nphenomenology of these different systems. In particular, the distribution of\nthe second pathway enzyme that maximizes the reaction flux undergoes a generic\ntransition from co-localization with the first enzyme when the catalytic\nefficiency of the second enzyme is low, to an extended profile when the\ncatalytic efficiency is high.

Molecular dynamics calculations on the ultraviolet photodissociation\nof different kinds of CO-H2O ice systems have been performed at 10 K in order\nto demonstrate that the reaction between CO and an OH molecule resulting from\nH2O photodissociation through the first excited state is a possible route to\nform CO2 ice. However, our calculations, which take into account different ice\nsurface models, suggest that there is another product with a higher formation\nprobability ((3.00+-0.07)x10-2), which is the HOCO complex, whereas the\nformation of CO2 has a probability of only (3.6+-0.7)x10-4. The initial\nlocation of the CO is key to obtain reaction and form CO2: the CO needs to be\nlocated deep into the ice. The HOCO complex becomes trapped in the cold ice\nsurface in the trans-HOCO minimum because it quickly loses its internal energy\nto the surrounding ice, preventing further reaction to H + CO2. Several\nlaboratory experiments have been carried out recently and they confirm that CO2\ncan also be formed through other, different routes. Here we compare our\ntheoretical results with the data available from experi- ments studying the\nformation of CO2 through a similar pathway as ours, even though the initial\nconditions were not exactly the same. Our results also show that the HCO van\nder Waals complex can be formed through the interaction of CO with the H atom\nthat is formed as a product of H2O photodissociation. Thus, the reaction of the\nH atom photofragment following H2O photodissociation with CO can be a possible\nroute to form HCO ice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Oct 2013 16:36:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

We provide new empirical\nrecipes to correct for dust attenuation given the observed UV luminosity and\nthe stellar mass. Our results also enable us to put new constraints on the\naverage relation between star formation rate and stellar mass at z~ 4, 3, and\n1.5. The star formation rate-stellar mass relations are well described by power\nlaws (SFR~ M^0.7), with the amplitudes being similar at z~4 and z~3, and\ndecreasing by a factor of 4 at z~1.5 at a given stellar mass.

The broadcast phase is for direct transmission whereas the relay phase\nis for relay transmission. Based on this TRA framework, a user selection based\nlow complexity relay protocol (US-LCRP) is proposed to combine CD and MUD. In\neach time slot (TS) of the broadcast phase, a \"best\" user is selected for\ntransmission in order to obtain MUD. In the relay phase, the relays forward the\nmessages of some specific users in a fixed order and then invoke the limited\nfeedback information to achieve CD. We demonstrate that the\ndiversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT) of the US-LCRP is superior to that of the\nexisting schemes, where more TSs are allocated for direct transmission in order\nto jointly exploit CD and MUD. Our analytical and numerical results show that\nthe US-LCRP constitutes a more efficient resource utilization approach than the\nexisting schemes. Additionally, the US-LCRP can be implemented with low\ncomplexity because only the direct links' channel state information (CSI) is\nestimated during the whole transmission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Oct 2013 19:14:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-18"}

The standard explanation of these measurements is in\nterms of the impact polarization caused by non-thermal proton and/or electron\nbeams. In this work, we study the possible role of resonance line polarization\ndue to radiation anisotropy in the inhomogeneous medium of the flare ribbons.\nWe consider a simple two-dimensional model of the flaring chromosphere and we\nsolve self-consistently the non-LTE problem taking into account the role of\nresonant scattering polarization and of the Hanle effect. Our calculations show\nthat the horizontal plasma inhomogeneities at the boundary of the flare ribbons\ncan lead to a significant radiation anisotropy in the line formation region\nand, consequently, to a fractional linear polarization of the emergent\nradiation of the order of several percent. Neglecting the effects of impact\npolarization, our model can provide a clue for resolving some of the common\nobservational findings, namely: (1) why a high degree of polarization appears\nmainly at the edges of the flare ribbons; (2) why polarization can also be\nobserved during the gradual phase of a flare; (3) why polarization is mostly\nradial or tangential. We conclude that the radiation transfer in the realistic\nmulti-dimensional models of solar flares needs to be considered as an essential\ningredient for understanding the observed spectral line polarization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Oct 2013 20:31:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

We present a detailed\ndiscussion of the implementation of a Wald-type procedure to calculate the\nangular momentum, showing how ambiguities that are absent in the usual\nasymptotically-flat case may be resolved by the requirement of gauge\ninvariance.

However, these\ndynamic computation systems possess evolutionary rules dependent on a\nneighborhood of adjacent cells, which limits their sampling radius and the\nenvironments that they can be used in.\n  The purpose of this study was to explore the complex nature of\none-dimensional CA in configurations other than that of the standard ECA.\nNamely, \"long-distance cellular automata\" (LDCA), a construct that had been\ndescribed in the past, but never studied. I experimented with a class of LDCA\nthat used spaced sample cells unlike ECA, and were described by the notation\nLDCA-x-y-n, where x and y represented the amount of spacing between the cell\nand its left and right neighbors, and n denoted the length of the initial tape\nfor tapes of finite size.

In this case,\nthe magnetar clearly exhibited a sudden spin-down, strongly challenging\nprevious glitch theories. Here we show that the anti-glitch can be well\nexplained by the collision of a small solid body with the magnetar. The\nintruder has a mass of about $1.1 \\times 10^{21}$ g. Its orbital angular\nmomentum is assumed to be antiparallel to that of the spinning magnetar, so\nthat the sudden spin-down can be naturally accounted for. The observed hard\nX-ray burst and decaying softer X-ray emission associated with the anti-glitch\ncan also be reasonably explained.

To increase\nsurvey area with a fixed observing time and pixel count, images from surveys\nsuch as the Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) or Euclid will\nnecessarily be undersampled and therefore distorted by aliasing. Oversampled,\nunaliased images can be obtained by combining multiple, dithered exposures of\nthe same source with a suitable reconstruction algorithm. Any such\nreconstruction must minimally distort the reconstructed images for weak lensing\nanalyses to be unbiased. In this paper, we use the IMage COMbination (IMCOM)\nalgorithm of Rowe, Hirata, and Rhodes to investigate the effect of image\ncombination on shape measurements (size and ellipticity). We simulate dithered\nimages of sources with varying amounts of ellipticity and undersampling,\nreconstruct oversampled output images from them using IMCOM, and measure shape\ndistortions in the output. Our simulations show that IMCOM creates no\nsignificant distortions when the relative offsets between dithered images are\nprecisely known. Distortions increase with the uncertainty in those offsets but\nbecome problematic only with relatively poor astrometric precision.

The ultimate goal is to apply automated segmentation\napproach to facilitate efficient MR-guided biopsy and radiation treatment\nplanning.

All of them assume a cooperative structural\nrearrangement as opposed to the only real one which is simply a variant of the\ncrystal growth. Like all kinds of crystal growth, a solid state phase\ntransition proceeds by molecule-by-molecule building building the crystal of a\ndifferent structure, while the surrounding original crystal is used as the\nbuilding material.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Oct 2013 02:30:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 Dec 2013 04:10:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-30"}
