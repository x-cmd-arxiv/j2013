The sample contains 33 high ionization\ngalaxies (HIGs) and 18 broad line objects (BLOs). According to the UM, HIGs,\nthe narrow line sources, are the nuclearly obscured counterparts of BLOs. The\nfraction of HIGs indicates a covering factor of the circumnuclear matter of 65%\nthat corresponds, adopting a torus geometry, to an opening angle of 50+/-5\ndegree. No dependence on redshift and luminosity on the torus opening angle\nemerges. We also consider the implications for a 'clumpy' torus. The\ndistributions of radio luminosity of HIGs and BLOs are not statistically\ndistinguishable, as expected from the UM. Conversely, BLOs have a radio core\ndominance, R, more than ten times larger than HIGs, as expected in case of jet\nDoppler boosting. Modeling the R distributions leads to an estimate of the jet\nbulk Lorentz factor of Gamma ~3-5. The test of the UM based on the radio source\nsize is not conclusive due to the limited number of objects. Studying the\nemission line ([OIII], [OII]and [OI]) properties of HEGs and BLOs, we find\nevidences of a narrow line region (NLR) density stratification and its partial\nobscuration from the torus.

We improve upon this bound and show\nthat this is true for every {\\alpha} >= 65n. To show this, we provide new and\nimproved results on the local structure of Nash equilibria. Technically, we\nshow that if there is a cycle in a Nash equilibrium, then {\\alpha} < 65n.\nProving this, we only consider relatively simple strategy changes of the\nplayers involved in the cycle. We further show that this simple approach cannot\nbe used to show the desired upper bound {\\alpha} < n (for which a cycle may\nexist), but conjecture that a slightly worse bound {\\alpha} < 1.3n can be\nachieved with this approach. Towards this conjecture, we show that if a Nash\nequilibrium has a cycle of length at most 10, then indeed {\\alpha} < 1.3n. We\nfurther provide experimental evidence suggesting that when the girth of a Nash\nequilibrium is increasing, the upper bound on {\\alpha} obtained by the simple\nstrategy changes is not increasing. To the end, we investigate the approach for\na coalitional variant of Nash equilibrium, where coalitions of two players\ncannot collectively improve, and show that if {\\alpha} >= 41n, then every such\nNash equilibrium is a tree.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Oct 2013 17:53:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-31"}

Consistent\nwith some previous studies, radiatively efficient AGN appear to be\npreferentially hosted in modest star-forming galaxies, with little dependence\non AGN or galaxy luminosity. AGN exhibiting radio-emitting jets due to\nmechanically-dominated accretion are almost exclusively observed in massive,\npassive galaxies. Crucially, we now provide strong evidence that the observed\nhost-galaxy trends are independent of redshift. In particular, these different\naccretion-mode AGN have remained as separate galaxy populations throughout the\nlast 9 Gyr. Furthermore, it appears that galaxies hosting AGN have evolved\nalong the same path as galaxies that are not hosting AGN with little evidence\nfor distinctly separate evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Oct 2013 20:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

Accretion flares can produce strong\nenergetic irradiation and heating that may affect the disk in the planet\nformation region, close to the central star. During an extreme accretion\noutburst in the young star EX Lupi, the prototype of EXor variables, remarkable\nchanges in molecular gas emission from $\\sim1$ AU in the disk have recently\nbeen observed (Banzatti et al. 2012). Here, we focus on water vapor and explore\nhow it is affected by variable accretion luminosity in T Tauri stars. We\nmonitored a young highly variable solar-mass star, DR Tau, using simultaneously\ntwo high/medium-resolution ESO-VLT spectrographs: VISIR at 12.4 $\\mu$m to\nobserve water lines from the disk, and X-shooter covering from 0.3 to 2.5\n$\\mu$m to constrain the stellar accretion. Three epochs spanning timescales\nfrom several days to several weeks were obtained. Accretion luminosity was\nestimated to change within a factor $\\sim2$, and no change in water emission\nwas detected at a significant level. In comparison to EX Lupi and EXor\noutbursts, DR Tau suggests that the less long-lived and weaker variability\nphenomena typical of T Tauri stars may leave water at planet-forming radii in\nthe disk mostly unaffected. We propose that these systems may provide evidence\nfor two processes that act over different timescales: UV photochemistry in the\ndisk atmosphere (faster) and heating of the disk deeper layers (slower).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Oct 2013 20:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

This could either be due to a true divergence in orbital\nperiod distributions of these two types of system, or to black hole LMXBs being\npreferentially hidden from view at short orbital periods. We explore the latter\npossibility, by investigating whether black hole LMXBs could be concealed by a\nswitch to radiatively inefficient accretion at low luminosities. The peak\nluminosity and the duration of X-ray binary outbursts are related to the disc\nradius and, hence, the orbital period. At short periods, where the peak\noutburst luminosity drops close to the threshold for radiatively inefficient\naccretion, black hole LMXBs have lower outburst luminosities, shorter outburst\ndurations and lower X-ray duty cycles than comparable neutron star systems.\nThese factors can combine to severely reduce the detection probability of short\nperiod black hole LMXBs relative to those containing neutron stars. We estimate\nthe outburst properties and orbital period distribution of black hole LMXBs\nusing two models of the transition to radiatively inefficient accretion: an\ninstantaneous drop in accretion efficiency (eta) to zero, at a fraction (f) of\nthe Eddington luminosity (L_Edd) and a power-law efficiency decrease, eta\n\\propto \\dot{M}^n, for L < f*L_Edd. We show that a population of black hole\nLMXBs at short orbital periods can only be hidden by a sharp drop in\nefficiency, either instantaneous or for n >= 3.

While there exist several separable representations\nfor the nucleon-nucleon interaction, the optical potential between a neutron\n(proton) and a nucleus is not readily available in separable form. The purpose\nof this paper is to introduce a separable representation for complex\nphenomenological optical potentials of Woods-Saxon type.\n  Results: Starting from a global optical potential, a separable representation\nthereof is introduced based on the Ernst-Shakin-Thaler (EST) scheme. This\nscheme is generalized to non-hermitian potentials. Applications to n$+^{48}$Ca,\nn$+^{132}$Sn and n$+^{208}$Pb are investigated for energies from 0 to 50 MeV\nand the quality of the representation is examined.\n  Conclusions: We find a good description of the on-shell t-matrix for all\nsystems with rank up to 5. The required rank depends inversely on the angular\nmomentum. The resulting separable interaction exhibits a different off-shell\nbehavior compared to the original potential, reducing the high momentum\ncontributions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Oct 2013 21:50:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-16"}

In particular, for a high magnetic field where\nthe iron core becomes saturated, the effective lengths and shapes of the field\ndistribution must be considered because they change with the excitation\ncurrent. Precise measurement of the three-dimensional magnetic fields and the\ncorrect application of parameters in the ion-optical calculations are\nnecessary. First we present a practical numerical method of extracting full 3D\nmagnetic field maps of magnetic multipoles from 2D field measurements of the\nsurface of a cylinder. Using this novel method we extracted the distributions\nalong the beam axis for the coefficient of the first-order quadrupole\ncomponent, which is the leading term of the quadrupole components in the\nmultipole expansion of magnetic fields and proportional to the distance from\nthe axis. Higher order components of the 3D magnetic field can be extracted\nfrom the leading term via recursion relations. The measurements were done for\nmany excitation current values for the large-aperture superconducting triplet\nquadrupole magnets (STQs) in the BigRIPS fragment separator at the RIKEN\nNishina Center RI Beam Factory. These distributions were parameterized using\nthe Enge functions to fit the fringe field shapes at all excitation current\nvalues, so that unmeasured values are interpolated. The extracted distributions\ndepend only on the position along the beam axis, and thus the measured\nthree-dimensional field can easily be parameterized for ion-optical\ncalculations. We implemented these parameters in the ion-optical calculation\ncode COSY INFINITY and realized a first-order calculation that incorporates the\neffect of large and varying fringe fields more accurately.

The bootstrap has shown promise in solving this problem, but empirical\nevidence often indicates that some bootstrap methods have difficulty in\nmaintaining the correct coverage probability, while other methods may be\nunstable, often resulting in very large confidence regions. One way to improve\nthe performance of a bootstrap confidence region is to restrict the shape of\nthe region in such a way that the error term of an expansion is as small an\norder as possible. To some extent, this can be achieved by using the bootstrap\nto construct an ellipsoidal confidence region.

While we are used to associating the notion of localization with\nmassive bodies, quantum physics teaches us that every individual object is\nassociated with a wave function that may eventually delocalize by far more than\nthe body's own extension. Numerous experiments have verified this concept at\nthe microscopic scale but intuition wavers when it comes to delocalization\nexperiments with complex objects.

High A/Q resolution is an essential requirement for this scheme,\nbecause the charge state Q of RI beams has to be identified at RIBF energies\nsuch as 200-300 MeV/nucleon. By precisely determining the Brho and TOF values,\nwe have achieved relative A/Q resolution as good as 0.034% (root-mean-square\nvalue).

In particular, the process known as\ncollisionless electron heating, whereby electrons are rapidly energized at the\nshock front, is one of the main open issues in shock physics. Here we present\nthe first clear evidence for efficient collisionless electron heating at the\nreverse shock of Tycho's supernova remnant (SNR), revealed by Fe-K diagnostics\nusing high-quality X-ray data obtained by the Suzaku satellite. We detect\nK-beta (3p->1s) fluorescence emission from low-ionization Fe ejecta excited by\nenergetic thermal electrons at the reverse shock front, which peaks at a\nsmaller radius than Fe K-alpha (2p->1s) emission dominated by a relatively\nhighly-ionized component. Comparison with our hydrodynamical simulations\nimplies instantaneous electron heating to a temperature 1000 times higher than\nexpected from Coulomb collisions alone. The unique environment of the reverse\nshock, which is propagating with a high Mach number into rarefied ejecta with a\nlow magnetic field strength, puts strong constraints on the physical mechanism\nresponsible for this heating, and favors a cross-shock potential created by\ncharge deflection at the shock front. Our sensitive observation also reveals\nthat the reverse shock radius of this SNR is about 10% smaller than the\nprevious measurement using the Fe K-alpha morphology from the Chandra\nobservations. Since strong Fe K-beta fluorescence is expected only from\nlow-ionization plasma where Fe ions still have many 3p electrons, this feature\nis key to diagnosing the plasma state and distribution of the immediate\npostshock ejecta in a young SNR.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Oct 2013 00:45:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

These systems are believed to\nform when a low- to intermediate-mass companion to a neutron star fills its\nRoche lobe between central hydrogen exhaustion and core helium ignition. We\nconfirm that our own stellar models reproduce a well-defined period-companion\nmass relation irrespective of the details of the mass transfer process. With\nmagnetic braking this relation extends to periods of less than 1d for a 1Msun\ngiant donor. With this and the measured binary mass functions we calculate the\norbital inclination of each system for a given pulsar mass. We expect these\ninclinations to be randomly oriented in space. If the masses of the pulsars\nwere typically 1.35Msun then there would appear to be a distinct dearth of\nhigh-inclination systems. However if the pulsar masses are more typically 1.55\nto 1.65Msun then the distribution of inclinations is indeed indistinguishable\nfrom random. If it were as much as 1.75Msun then there would appear to be an\nexcess of high-inclination systems. Thus with the available data we can argue\nthat the neutron star masses in binary millisecond pulsars recycled by mass\ntransfer from a red giant typically lie around 1.6Msun and that there is no\npreferred inclination at which these systems are observed. Hence there is\nreason to believe that pulsar beams are either sufficiently broad or show no\npreferred direction relative to the pulsar's spin axis which is aligned with\nthe binary orbit. This is contrary to some previous claims, based on a subset\nof the data available today, that there might be a tendency for the pulsar\nbeams to be perpendicular to their spin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Oct 2013 01:10:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

The screening of this defect potential by\nan exciton condensate is studied. We find asymptotic spatial dependence of the\nscreened potential and analyse its dependence on the temperature and exciton\nconcentration. It is shown that the asymptotic of the screened potential has a\nsteep power law dependence in contrast to the well known results of electron\ngas. This peculiarity reflects the bosonic nature of the exciton condensate.\nThe behavior of exciton condensate under external alternative field created by\na surface acoustic wave (SAW) is examined in detail. We focus our attention on\nthe dependence of SAW absorption coefficient on temperature and exciton\nconcentration. We found that at zero temperatures Landau damping does not\ncontribute to the SAW absorption, but the Belyaev mechanism produces unusual\nbehavior of SAW absorption coefficient on exciton concentration: if the exciton\nconcentration exceeds some critical value, the SAW absorption vanishes. At\nfinite temperatures Landau damping comes into action and results in washing out\nthe sharp absorption behavior. Such unusual SAW absorption properties can be\nused for experimental evidence of the exciton condensation.

The algorithm samples a candidate\nsolution from a standard multivariate normal distribution scaled by a step-size\nand centered in the current solution. This solution is accepted if it has a\nbetter objective function value than the current one. Crucial to the algorithm\nis the adaptation of the step-size that is done in order to maintain a certain\nprobability of success. The algorithm, already proposed in the 60's, is a\ngeneralization of the well-known Rechenberg's $(1+1)$ Evolution Strategy (ES)\nwith one-fifth success rule which was also proposed by Devroye under the name\ncompound random search or by Schumer and Steiglitz under the name step-size\nadaptive random search. In addition to be derivative-free, the algorithm is\nfunction-value-free: it exploits the objective function only through\ncomparisons. It belongs to the class of comparison-based step-size adaptive\nrandomized search (CB-SARS). For the convergence analysis, we follow the\nmethodology developed in a companion paper for investigating linear convergence\nof CB-SARS: by exploiting invariance properties of the algorithm, we turn the\nstudy of global linear convergence on scaling-invariant functions into the\nstudy of the stability of an underlying normalized Markov chain (MC). We hence\nprove global linear convergence by studying the stability (irreducibility,\nrecurrence, positivity, geometric ergodicity) of the normalized MC associated\nto the $(1+1)$-ES. More precisely, we prove that starting from any initial\nsolution and any step-size, linear convergence with probability one and in\nexpectation occurs. Our proof holds on unimodal functions that are the\ncomposite of strictly increasing functions by positively homogeneous functions\nwith degree $\\alpha$ (assumed also to be continuously differentiable). This\nfunction class includes composite of norm functions but also non-quasi convex\nfunctions. Because of the composition by a strictly increasing function, it\nincludes non continuous functions. We find that a sufficient condition for\nglobal linear convergence is the step-size increase on linear functions, a\ncondition typically satisfied for standard parameter choices. While introduced\nmore than 40 years ago, we provide here the first proof of global linear\nconvergence for the $(1+1)$-ES with generalized one-fifth success rule and the\nfirst proof of linear convergence for a CB-SARS on such a class of functions\nthat includes non-quasi convex and non-continuous functions. Our proof also\nholds on functions where linear convergence of some CB-SARS was previously\nproven, namely convex-quadratic functions (including the well-know sphere\nfunction).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Oct 2013 06:38:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-01"}

Five WBCs, three belonging to the\nsurface energy (SE) formulation using the linear, cubic and sine functions\n(denoted as LinSE, CubSE and SinSE), the fourth using a geometric formulation\n(Geom), and the fifth using a characteristic interpolation (CI), were compared\nwith each other through the study of several problems: (1) the static contact\nangle of a drop; (2) a Poiseuille flow-driven liquid column; (3) a wettability\ngradient (WG)-driven liquid column; (4) drop dewetting. It was found that while\nall WBCs can predict the static contact angle fairly accurately, they may\naffect the simulation outcomes of dynamic problems differently, depending on\nthe driving mechanism. For the flow-driven problem, to use different WBCs had\nalmost no effect on the flow characteristics over a large scale. But for other\ncapillarity-driven problems, the WBC had some noticeable effects. For the\nWG-driven liquid column, Geom gave the most consistent prediction between the\ndrop velocity and dynamic contact angles, and LinSE delivered the poorest\nprediction in this aspect. Except for Geom, the dynamic contact angle differed\nfrom the prescribed (static) one when other WBCs were used. For drop dewetting,\nGeom led to the most violent drop motion whereas CubSE caused the weakest\nmotion; the initial contact line velocity was also found to be dependent on the\nWBC. For several problems, CubSE and SinSE gave almost the same results, and\nthose by Geom and CI were close as well, possibly due to similar consideration\nin their design. Besides various comparisons, a new implementation that may be\nused for all WBCs was proposed to mimic the wall energy relaxation and control\nthe degree of slip.

Sunspot number is a benchmark series in many studies, but may still\ncontain inhomogeneities and inconsistencies. In particular, an essential\ndiscrepancy exists between the two main sunspot number series, Wolf (WSN) and\ngroup (GSN) sunspot numbers, before 1848. The source of this discrepancy has so\nfar remained unresolved. However, the recently digitized series of solar\nobservations in 1825-1867 by Samuel Heinrich Schwabe, who was the primary\nobserver of the WSN before 1848, makes such an assessment possible. Methods. We\nconstruct sunspot series, similar to WSN and GSN, but using only Schwabe's\ndata. These series, called WSN-S and GSN-S, respectively, were compared with\nthe original WSN and GSN series for the period 1835-1867 to look for possible\ninhomogeneities. Results. We show that: (1) The GSN series is homogeneous and\nconsistent with the Schwabe data throughout the entire studied period; (2) The\nWSN series decreases by roughly ~20% around 1848 caused by the change of the\nprimary observer from Schwabe to Wolf and an inappropriate individual\ncorrection factor used for Schwabe in the WSN; (3) This implies a major\ninhomogeneity in the WSN, which needs to be corrected by reducing its values by\n20% before 1848; (4) The corrected WSN series is in good agreement with the GSN\nseries. This study supports the earlier conclusions that the GSN series is more\nconsistent and homogeneous in the earlier part than the WSN series.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Oct 2013 10:14:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 1 Nov 2013 07:04:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-04"}

The presence of dust grains,\nwhich allow many chemical reactions to occur on their surfaces, strongly\nimpacts the chemical composition of a cloud. At low temperatures, dust grains\ncan lock-up species from the gas phase which freeze out and form ices. In this\nsense, dust can deplete important coolants. Our aim is to understand the\neffects of freeze-out on the thermal balance and the evolution of a\ngravitationally bound molecular cloud. For this purpose, we perform 3D\nhydrodynamical simulations with the adaptive mesh code FLASH. We simulate a\ngravitationally unstable cloud under two different conditions, with and without\ngrain surface chemistry. We let the cloud evolve until one free-fall time is\nreached and track the thermal evolution and the abundances of species during\nthis time. We see that at a number density of 10$^4$ cm$^{-3}$ most of the CO\nmolecules are frozen on dust grains in the run with grain surface chemistry,\nthereby depriving the most important coolant. As a consequence, we find that\nthe temperature of the gas rises up to $\\sim$25 K. The temperature drops once\nagain due to gas-grain collisional cooling when the density reaches a\nfew$\\times$10$^4$ cm$^{-3}$. We conclude that grain surface chemistry not only\naffects the chemical abundances in the gas phase, but also leaves a distinct\nimprint in the thermal evolution that impacts the fragmentation of a\nstar-forming cloud.

Scivetti and M. Persson, Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter 25,\n355006 (2013)]. The missing interactions between the metal substrate and the\ninsulating film in the PC approximation are modelled by a simple force field\n(FF). The parameters of the PC model and the force field are obtained from DFT\ncalculations of the film and the substrate, here shown explicitly for a NaCl\nbilayer supported by a Cu(100) surface. In order to obtain some of these\nparameters and the polarisability of the force field, we have to include an\nexternal, uniformly charged plane in the DFT calculations, which has required\nthe development of a periodic DFT formalism to include such a charged plane in\nthe presence of a metal substrate. This extension and implementation should be\nof more general interest and applicable to other challenging problems, for\ninstance, in electrochemistry. As illustrated for the gold atom on the NaCl\nbilayer supported by a Cu(100) surface, our new DFT-PC-FF method allows us to\nhandle different charge states of adsorbates in a controlled and accurate\nmanner with a considerable reduction of the computational time. In addition, it\nis now possible to calculate vertical transition and reorganisation energies\nfor charging and discharging of adsorbates that cannot be obtained by current\nDFT methodologies that include the metal substrate.

The estimates then rely on a subtle analysis\nof $g_{n}$ and its derivatives which we will also present in this paper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Oct 2013 13:29:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-01"}

A common limitation of all\nnon-volatile devices is their limited write endurance. Further, since existing\ncache management policies are write-variation unaware, excessive writes to a\nfew blocks may lead to a quick failure of the whole cache. We propose an\narchitectural technique for wear-leveling of non-volatile last level caches\n(LLCs). Our technique uses cache-coloring approach which adds a\nsoftware-controlled mapping layer between groups of physical pages and cache\nsets. Periodically the mapping is altered to ensure that write-traffic can be\nspread uniformly to different sets of the cache to achieve wear-leveling.\nSimulations performed with an x86-64 simulator and SPEC2006 benchmarks show\nthat our technique reduces the worst-case writes to cache blocks and thus\nimproves the cache lifetime by 4.07X.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Oct 2013 13:33:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-01"}

In order to better understand the origin of the gamma-ray\nemission and locate it within the galaxy, we studied contemporaneous\nmulti-frequency observations of NGC 1275 and modeled the overall spectral\nenergy distribution (SED). We analyzed unpublished MAGIC observations carried\nout between Oct. 2009 and Feb. 2010, and the previously published ones taken\nbetween Aug. 2010 and Feb. 2011. We studied the multi-band variability and\ncorrelations by analyzing data of Fermi-LAT (0.1-100 GeV), as well as Chandra\n(X-ray), KVA (optical) and MOJAVE (radio) data taken during the same period.\nUsing customized Monte Carlo simulations corresponding to early MAGIC stereo\ndata, we detect NGC 1275 also in the earlier campaign. The flux level and\nenergy spectra are similar to the results of the second campaign. The monthly\nlight curve >100 GeV shows a hint of variability at the 3.6 sigma level. In the\nFermi-LAT band, both flux and spectral shape variabilities are reported. The\noptical light curve is variable and shows a clear correlation with the\ngamma-ray flux >100 MeV. In radio, 3 compact components are resolved in the\ninnermost part of the jet. One of them shows a similar trend as the LAT and KVA\nlight curves. The 0.1-650 GeV spectra measured simultaneously with MAGIC and\nFermi-LAT can be well fitted either by a log-parabola or by a power-law with a\nsub-exponential cutoff for both campaigns. A single-zone\nsynchrotron-self-Compton model, with an electron spectrum following a power-law\nwith an exponential cutoff, can explain the broadband SED and the multi-band\nbehavior of the source. However, this model suggests an untypical low\nbulk-Lorentz factor or a velocity alignment closer to the line of sight than\nthe pc-scale radio jet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Oct 2013 13:47:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 5 Mar 2014 15:03:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-06"}

Polar coronal holes are the main\nsource of deflection in the rise and declining phases of solar cycles. In the\nmaximum phase, deflection by large-scale streamers or pseudo streamers\noverlying high-latitude filaments seems to be important. The B0 angle reduced\nthe ecliptic distance of some GLE source regions and increased in others with\nthe net result that the average latitude of GLE events did not change\nsignificantly. The non-radial CME motion is the dominant factor that reduces\nthe ecliptic distance of GLE source regions, thereby improving the latitudinal\nconnectivity to Earth.

The objective of this study is to detect changes in the water level\nrelationship between consecutive gauge stations along the Solim\\~oes/Amazonas\nmain channel, since 1980. To carry out the analyses, data spanning from 1980 to\n2010 from three consecutive gauges (Tefe, Manaus and Obidos) were used to\ncompute standardized daily anomalies. In particular for infra-annual periods it\nwas possible to detect changes for the water level variability along the\nSolim\\~oes/Amazonas main channel, by applying the Morlet Wavelet Transformation\n(WT) and Wavelet Cross Coherence (WCC) methods. It was possible to quantify the\nwaves amplitude for the WT infra-annual scaled-period and were quite similar to\nthe three gauge stations denoting that the water level variability are related\nto the same hydrological forcing functions. Changes in the WCC was detected for\nthe Manaus-Obidos river stretch and this characteristic might be associated\nwith land cover changes in the floodplains. The next steps of this research,\nwill be to test this hypotheses by integrating land cover changes into the\nfloodplain with hydrological modelling simulations throughout the time-series.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Oct 2013 14:38:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-01"}

These disagreements do not much affect the ordinary practice of\nscience which is about small subsystems of the universe, described or explained\nagainst a background, idealized to be fixed. But these issues become crucial\nwhen we consider including the whole universe within our system, for then there\nis no fixed background to reference observables to. I argue here that the key\nissue responsible for divergent versions of naturalism and divergent approaches\nto cosmology is the conception of time. One version, which I call temporal\nnaturalism, holds that time, in the sense of the succession of present moments,\nis real, and that laws of nature evolve in that time. This is contrasted with\ntimeless naturalism, which holds that laws are immutable and the present moment\nand its passage are illusions. I argue that temporal naturalism is empirically\nmore adequate than the alternatives, because it offers testable explanations\nfor puzzles its rivals cannot address, and is likely a better basis for solving\nmajor puzzles that presently face cosmology and physics.\n  This essay also addresses the problem of qualia and experience within\nnaturalism and argues that only temporal naturalism can make a place for qualia\nas intrinsic qualities of matter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Oct 2013 15:08:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-01"}

Fundamental stellar parameters were determined by means of the code\nFASTWIND. Projected rotational and extra broadening velocities originate from a\ncombined Ft + GOF method. Model calculations published previously were used to\nestimate the initial evolutionary masses. The sample O stars with Minit > 50\nMsun rotate with less that 26% of their break-up velocity, and they also lack\nobjects with v sin i < 50 km/s. For the stars with Minit > 35 Msun on the\nhotter side of the bi-stability jump, the observed and predicted rotational\nrates agree quite well; for those on the cooler side of the jump, the measured\nvelocities are systematically higher than the predicted ones. In general, the\nderived extra broadening velocities decrease toward cooler Teff, whilst for\nlater evolutionary phases they appear, at the same v sin i, higher for\nhigh-mass stars than for low-mass ones. None of the sample stars shows extra\nbroadening velocities higher than 110 km/s. For the majority of the more\nmassive stars, extra broadening either dominates or is in strong competition\nwith rotation. Conclusions: For OB stars of solar metallicity, extra broadening\nis important and has to be accounted for in the analysis.

The cell in\ncontact with substrate has only one (adhesion) point to work with, and thus a\nnew method of measurement needs to be invented. The aim of this theoretical\nwork is to develop a self-consistent physical model for mechanosensitivity, a\nprocess by which a cell detects the mechanical stiffness of its environment\n(e.g. a substrate it is attached to via adhesion points) and generates an\nappropriate chemical signaling to remodel itself in response to this\nenvironment. The model uses the molecular mechanosensing complex of latent\nTGF-$\\beta$ attached to the adhesion point as the biomarker. We show that the\nunderlying Brownian motion in the substrate is the reference element in the\nmeasuring process. The model produces the closed expression for the rate of\nrelease of active TGF-$\\beta$, which depends on the substrate stiffness and the\npulling force coming from the cell in a subtle and non-trivial way. It is\nconsistent with basic experimental data showing an increase in signal for\nstiffer substrates and higher pulling forces. In addition, we find that for\neach cell there is a range of stiffness where a homeostatic configuration of\nthe cell can be achieved, outside of which the cell either relaxes its\ncytoskeletal forces and detaches from the very weak substrate, or generates an\nincreasingly strong pulling force through stress fibers with a positive\nfeedback loop on very stiff substrates. In this way, the theory offers the\nunderlying mechanism for the myofibroblast conversion in wound healing and\nsmooth muscle cell dysfunction in cardiac disease.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Oct 2013 15:44:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 28 Dec 2014 16:26:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

In this paper the conjecture is verified for\n$K=\\mathbb{R}$ and $n=2$, also for semi-homogeneous polynomials $p$, with a\npartial solution for an arbitrary field $K$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Oct 2013 15:55:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 Nov 2013 20:42:26 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 13 Nov 2013 20:37:40 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 15 Dec 2013 14:36:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-17"}

However, in contrast to bulk\nfluids, properties of inhomogeneous fluids are seldom studied at the\npair-distribution level. Motivated by recent experimental advances in\ndetermining anisotropic structure factors of confined fluids, we analyze\ntheoretically the underlying anisotropic pair distributions of the archetypical\nhard-sphere fluid confined between two parallel hard surfaces using\nfirst-principles statistical mechanics of inhomogeneous fluids. For this\npurpose, we introduce an experimentally accessible ensemble-averaged local\ndensity correlation function and study its behavior as a function of confining\nslit width. Upon increasing the distance between the confining surfaces, we\nobserve an alternating sequence of strongly anisotropic versus more isotropic\nlocal order. The latter is due to packing frustration of the spherical\nparticles. This observation highlights the importance of studying inhomogeneous\nfluids at the pair-distribution level.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Oct 2013 15:58:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-01"}

We suppose that these masses are pressureless in the\nexternal space but they have relativistic pressure in the internal space. We\nshow that metric perturbations do not depend on coordinates of the internal\nspace and gravitating masses should be uniformly smeared over the internal\nspace. This means, first, that KK modes corresponding to the metric\nfluctuations are absent and, second, particles should be only in the ground\nquantum state with respect to the internal space. In our opinion, these results\nlook very unnatural. According to statistical physics, any nonzero temperature\nshould result in fluctuations, i.e. in KK modes.
