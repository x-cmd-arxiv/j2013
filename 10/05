First, the\ntheorems only establish that there exists some probabilistic model; they do not\nestablish that there exists a useful probabilistic model, i.e. one with a\ntractably small number of numerical parameters and a large number of\nindependence assumptions. Second, there are in general many different\nprobabilistic models for a given situation, many of which may be far more\nirrational, in the usual sense of the term, than a model that violates the\naxioms of probability theory. I illustrate this second point with an extended\nexamples of two tasks of induction, of a similar structure, where the\nreasonable probabilistic models are very different.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Oct 2013 16:04:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-07"}

Two vector valued fields are constants of the motion: the velocity\nfield in the Burgers case and the momentum field per unit mass in the\nEuler-Coriolis one.

One method is based on a\ndynamical analysis of the stellar component. The second method is closer to\ntechniques commonly employed in observational studies. Both the dynamical\nmethod and the method based on the surface brightness limit criterion are\napplied to the same set of hydrodynamical simulations for a large sample about\n80 galaxy clusters.\n  We find significant differences between the ICL and DSC fractions computed\nwith the two corresponding methods, which amounts to about a factor of two for\nthe AGN simulations, and a factor of four for the CSF set. We also find that\nthe inclusion of AGN feedback boosts the DSC and ICL fractions by a factor of\n1.5-2, respectively, while leaving the BCG+ICL and BCG+DSC mass fraction almost\nunchanged. The sum of the BCG and DSC mass stellar mass fraction is found to\ndecrease from ~80 per cent in galaxy groups to ~60 per cent in rich clusters,\nthus in excess of what found from observational analysis.\n  We identify the average surface brightness limits that yields the ICL\nfraction from the SBL method close to the DSC fraction from the dynamical\nmethod. These surface brightness limits turn out to be brighter in the CSF than\nin the AGN simulations. This is consistent with the finding that AGN feedback\nmakes BCGs to be less massive and with shallower density profiles than in the\nCSF simulations. The BCG stellar component, as identified by both methods, are\nslightly older and more metal-rich than the stars in the diffuse component.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Oct 2013 20:00:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 Nov 2013 07:09:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

The turbulent nature of the wind\ncreates a complex flow environment, and causes the filaments to propagate in\nthe form of patches with varying concentration distributions. Inspired by moth\nnavigation capabilities, we propose a navigation strategy that enables a flier\nto locate a pulsating odor source in a windy environment using a single\nthreshold-based detection sensor. The strategy is constructed based on the\nphysical properties of the turbulent flow carrying discrete puffs of odor and\ndoes not involve learning, memory, complex decision making or statistical\nmethods. We suggest that in turbulent plumes from a pulsating point source, an\ninstantaneously measurable quantity referred as a \"puff crossing time\",\nimproves the success rate as compared to the navigation strategy based on\n\"internal counter\" that does not use this information. Using computer\nsimulations of fliers navigating in turbulent plumes of the pulsating point\nsource for varying flow parameters: turbulent intensities, plume meandering and\nwind gusts, we obtained trajectories qualitatively resembling male moths\nflights towards the pheromone sources. We quantified the probability of a\nsuccessful navigation as well as the flight parameters such as the time spent\nsearching and the total flight time, with respect to different turbulent\nintensities, meandering or gusts.

On the other hand, IR is\noften based on the discrete forward model of X-ray transform and formulated as\na minimization problem with some appropriate image regularization method, so\nthat the reconstructed image corresponds to the minimizer of the optimization\nproblem. This work is to investigate the fused analytical and iterative\nreconstruction (AIR) method.\n  Methods: Based on IR with L1-type image regularization, AIR is formulated\nwith a AR-specific preconditioner in the data fidelity term, which results in\nthe minimal change of the solution algorithm that replaces the adjoint X-ray\ntransform by the filtered X-ray transform. As a proof-of-concept 2D example of\nAIR, FBP is incorporated into tensor framelet (TF) regularization based IR, and\nthe formulated AIR minimization problem is then solved through split Bregman\nmethod with GPU-accelerated X-ray transform and filtered adjoint X-ray\ntransform.\n  Conclusion: AIR, the fused Analytical and Iterative Reconstruction method, is\nproposed with a proof-of-concept 2D example to synergize FBP and TF-regularized\nIR, with improved image resolution and contrast for experimental data. The\npotential impact of AIR is that it offers a general framework to develop\nvarious AR enhanced IR methods, when neither AR nor IR alone is sufficient.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Oct 2013 02:45:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-08"}

A spine field line links distinct\nflux domains, but direct observation of such feature has been rare. Here we\nreport a unique event observed by the Solar Dynamic Observatory where a set of\nhot coronal loops (over 10 MK) connected to a quasi-circular chromospheric\nribbon at one end and a remote brightening at the other. Magnetic field\nextrapolation suggests these loops are partly tracer of the evolving spine\nfield line. Continuous slipping- and null-point-type reconnections were likely\nat work, energizing the loop plasma and transferring magnetic flux within and\nacross the fan quasi-separatrix layer. We argue that the initial reconnection\nis of the \"breakout\" type, which then transitioned to a more violent flare\nreconnection with an eruption from the fan dome. Significant magnetic field\nchanges are expected and indeed ensued. This event also features an\nextreme-ultraviolet (EUV) late phase, i.e. a delayed secondary emission peak in\nwarm EUV lines (about 2-7 MK). We show that this peak comes from the cooling of\nlarge post-reconnection loops beside and above the compact fan, a direct\nproduct of eruption in such topological settings. The long cooling time of the\nlarge arcades contributes to the long delay; additional heating may also be\nrequired. Our result demonstrates the critical nature of cross-scale magnetic\ncoupling - topological change in a sub-system may lead to explosions on a much\nlarger scale.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Oct 2013 03:24:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

Geophysical turbulence is characterized by significant\nintermittent cascades of energy from the unresolved to the resolved scales\nresulting in complex patterns of waves, jets, and vortices. Conventional SP\nsimulates large scale dynamics on a coarse grid in a physical domain, and\ncouples these dynamics to high-resolution simulations on periodic domains\nembedded in the coarse grid. Stochastic SP replaces the nonlinear,\ndeterministic eddy equations on periodic embedded domains by quasilinear\nstochastic approximations on formally infinite embedded domains. The result is\na seamless algorithm which never uses a small scale grid and is far cheaper\nthan conventional SP, but with significant success in difficult test problems.\nVarious design choices in the algorithm are investigated in detail here,\nincluding decoupling the timescale of evolution on the embedded domains from\nthe length of the time step used on the coarse grid, and sensitivity to certain\nassumed properties of the eddies (e.g. the shape of the assumed eddy energy\nspectrum).

Yet, in a number of materials, in particular the\nhigh-temperature superconductors and the layered organic superconductors, they\nfail. In these lecture notes for an international school, I emphasize that even\nthough the low energy properties of a phase of matter are generally emergent\nand entirely determined by the broken symmetry, there are many differences\nbetween a strongly correlated and a weakly correlated state of matter. For\nexample, spin waves are an emergent property for antiferromagnets, but for weak\ncorrelations the normal phase of a (Slater) antiferromagnet is metallic,\nwhereas it is insulating (Heisenberg) for strong correlations. As a function of\ninteraction strength, above the antiferromagnetic phase, the crossover between\na metal and a local moment paramagnetic insulator is described by the Mott\ntransition, whose mean-field theory down to T=0 is best formulated with\ndynamical mean-field theory. A similar situation occurs for superconductors:\ndespite similar emergent properties, there are many differences between both\nkinds of superconductors. Experimental evidence suggests that hole-doped\ncuprates are strongly correlated whereas the correlations are weaker in the\nelectron-doped case, especially near optimal doping. Evidence for a pseudogap\narising from antiferromagnetic fluctuations is strong in the latter case,\nwhereas in the hole-doped case the pseudogap temperature appears as a\nconsequence of Mott physics. In cluster dynamical mean-field theory, the\npseudogap line T* is a Widom line arising from a T=0 first-order transition\nthat terminates at a finite T critical point. Strongly correlated\nsuperconductors are much more resilient to near-neighbor repulsion than their\nweakly correlated counterpart. Many different methods to attack these problems\ntheoretically are described.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Oct 2013 14:46:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-17"}

For puller-like\nmicroswimmers an increase in the viscosity has been observed. It has been\nsuggested that the persistence of the orientation of the microswimmers hinders\nthe rotation that is normally caused by the vorticity. It was previously shown\nthat some sorts of algaes are bottom-heavy swimmers, i.e. their centre of mass\nis not located in the centre of the body. In this way, the algae affects the\nvorticity of the flow when it is perpendicular oriented to the axis of gravity.\nThis orientation of gravity to vorticity is given in a rheometer that is\nequipped with a cone-plate geometry. Here we present measurements of the\nviscosity both in a cone-plate and a Taylor-Couette cell. The two set-ups\nyielded the same increase in viscosity although the axis of gravitation in the\nTaylor-Couette cell is parallel to the direction of vorticity. In a\ncomplementary experiment we tested the orientation of the direction of swimming\nthrough microscopic observation of single \\textit{Chlamydomonas reinhardtii}\nand could not identify a preferred orientation, i. e. our specific strain of\n\\textit{Chlamydomonas reinhardtii} are not bottom-heavy swimmers. We thus\nconclude that bottom heaviness is not a prerequisite for the increase of\nviscosity and that the effect of gravity on the rheology of our strain of\n\\textit{Chlamydomonas reinhardtii} is negligible. This finding reopens the\nquestion of whether origin of persistence in the orientation of cells is\nactually responsible for the increased viscosity of the suspension.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Oct 2013 14:46:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-08"}

We numerically model the distortions of the\nmagnetosphere of pulsar B by the magnetized wind from pulsar A, including\neffects of magnetic reconnection and of the geodetic precession. Geodetic\nprecession leads to secular evolution of the geometric parameters and\neffectively allows a 3D view of the magnetosphere. Using the two complimentary\nmodels of pulsar B's magnetosphere, adapted from the Earth's magnetosphere\nmodels by Tsyganenko (ideal pressure confinement) and Dungey (highly resistive\nlimit), we determine the precise location and shape of the coherent radio\nemission generation region within pulsar B's magnetosphere. We successfully\nreproduce orbital variations and secular evolution of the profile of B, as well\nas subpulse drift (due to reconnection between the magnetospheric and wind\nmagnetic fields), and determine the location and the shape of the emission\nregion. The emission region is located at about 3750 stellar radii and has a\nhorseshoe-like shape, which is centered on the polar magnetic field lines. The\nbest fit angular parameters of the emission region indicate that radio emission\nis generated on the field lines which, according to the theoretical models,\noriginate close to the poles and carry the maximum current. When considered\ntogether, the results of the two models converge and can explain why the\nmodulation of B's radio emission at A's period is observed only within a\ncertain orbital phase region.
