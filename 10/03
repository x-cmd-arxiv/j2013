The theoretical predictions are validated by\nmeans of Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics simulations, showing that\nNavier-Stokes hydrodynamics produces accurate segregation criteria even under\nstrong shearing and/or inelasticity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Oct 2013 17:12:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Apr 2014 15:23:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-15"}

After making the appropriate\nmodifications, accurate initial guesses for the spectral parameters are no\nlonger needed so Monte-Carlo techniques can now be used to ensure the best fit\nto the observables. ii) The method is extended here to use masses and tidal\ndeformabilities (which will be measured by gravitational wave observations of\nneutron-star mergers) as the macroscopic observables instead of masses and\nradii. The accuracy and reliability of this extended and more robust spectral\nmethod is evaluated in this paper using mock data for observables from stars\nbased on 34 different theoretical models of the high density neutron-star\nequation of state.

This rotation was used as one of the\ncriteria to determine if Voyager 1 (V1) had crossed the HP. Recently the\nVoyager team concluded that V1 crossed into interstellar space last year\n(Gurnett et al. 2013). The question is then why there was no significant\nrotation in the direction of the magnetic field across the HP (Burlaga et al.\n2013). Here we present simulations that reveal that strong rotations in the\ndirection of the magnetic field at the HP at the location of V1 (and Voyager 2)\nare not expected. The solar magnetic field strongly affects the drapping of the\ninterstellar magnetic field (BISM) around the HP. BISM twists as it approaches\nthe HP and acquires a strong T component (east-west).

H-gamma showed a maximum 3-sigma and\n4-sigma deviation in each flare, respectively, corresponding to a factor of 1.7\nand 2.5 increase in flux.

We used the radiative transfer code RADMC to\nsuccessfully model the SED of 17 M-type stars detected at PACS wavelengths.

The Herschel/PACS\nobservations of low-mass stars in Cha-I provide new constraints on their disk\nproperties, overall suggesting that disk parameters for early M-type stars are\ncomparable to those for more massive stars (e.g., comparable scale height and\nflaring angles). However, regions of the disks emitting at about 100 $\\mu$m may\nstill be in the optically thick regime, preventing direct determination of disk\nmasses.

We were able to\nexpand scaling relations at very low frequency. This helped us to identify the\ndifferent sequences of period-luminosity relations, and allowed us to propose a\ncalibration of the K magnitude with the observed frequency large separation.\nInterpreting period-luminosity relations in red giants in terms of solar-like\noscillations allows us to investigate, with a firm physical basis, the time\nseries obtained from ground-based microlensing surveys. This can be done with\nan analytical expression that describes the low-frequency oscillation spectra.\nThe different behavior of oscillations at low frequency, with frequency\nseparations scaling only approximately with the square root of the mean stellar\ndensity, can be used to address precisely the physics of the semi-regular\nvariables.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Oct 2013 20:35:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Oct 2013 07:33:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

Most basic are the points\nthat there is no security parameter in such protocols and it is not the case\nthe generated key is perfect with probability $\\geq 1-\\epsilon$ under the trace\ndistance criterion $d\\leq\\epsilon$, which is widely claimed in the technical\nand popular literature. The many serious security consequences of this error\nabout the QKD generated key would be explained, including practical\nramification on achievable security levels. It will be shown how the error\ncorrection problem alone may already defy rigorous quantitative analysis.\nVarious other problems would be touched upon. It is pointed out that rigorous\nsecurity guarantee of much more efficient quantum cryptosystems may be obtained\nby abandoning the disturbance-information tradeoff principle and utilizing\ninstead the known KCQ (keyed communication in quantum noise) principle in\nconjunction with a new DBM (decoy bits method) principle that will be detailed\nelsewhere.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Oct 2013 21:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Oct 2013 14:33:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-23"}

We propose that the magnetic field was amplified to this values\nalready during the formation and the early evolution of the galaxies.\nTurbulence in young galaxies is driven by accretion as well as by supernova\n(SN) explosions of the first generation of stars. The small-scale dynamo can\nconvert the turbulent kinetic energy into magnetic energy and amplify very weak\nprimordial magnetic seed fields on short timescales. The amplification takes\nplace in two phases: in the kinematic phase the magnetic field grows\nexponentially, with the largest growth on the smallest non-resistive scale. In\nthe following non-linear phase the magnetic energy is shifted towards larger\nscales until the dynamo saturates on the turbulent forcing scale. To describe\nthe amplification of the magnetic field quantitatively we model the\nmicrophysics in the interstellar medium (ISM) of young galaxies and determine\nthe growth rate of the small-scale dynamo. We estimate the resulting saturation\nfield strengths and dynamo timescales for two turbulent forcing mechanisms:\naccretion-driven turbulence and SN-driven turbulence. We compare them to the\nfield strength that is reached, when only stellar magnetic fields are\ndistributed by SN explosions. We find that the small-scale dynamo is much more\nefficient in magnetizing the ISM of young galaxies. In the case of\naccretion-driven turbulence a magnetic field strength of the order of 10^-6 G\nis reached after a time of 24-270 Myr, while in SN-driven turbulence the dynamo\nsaturates at field strengths of typically 10^-5 G after only 4-15 Myr.

The tensor-gluons have zero electric charge, like\ngluons, but have a larger spin. Inside the proton a nonzero density of the\ntensor-gluons can be generated by the emission of tensor-gluons by gluons. The\nlast mechanism is typical for non-Abelian tensor gauge theories, in which there\nexists a gluon-tensor-tensor vertex of order g. Therefore the number of gluons\nchanges not only because a quark may radiate a gluon or because a gluon may\nsplit into a quark-antiquark pair or into two gluons, but also because a gluon\ncan split into two tensor-gluons. The process of gluon splitting suggests that\npart of the proton momentum which was carried by neutral partons is shared\nbetween vector and tensor gluons. We derive evolution equations for the parton\ndistribution functions which take into account these new processes. The\nmomentum sum rule allows to find the tensor-gluons contribution to the\nCallan-Simanzik beta function and to calculate the corresponding anomalous\ndimensions. This contribution changes the behavior of the structure functions,\nand the logarithmic correction to the Bjorken scaling becomes more mild.

As a test of this prediction, we have carried out\na search for variability in Type 2 quasars in SDSS Stripe 82 using\ndifference-imaging photometry. Starting with the Type 2 AGN catalogs of\nZakamska et al. (2003) and Reyes et al.

To determine the nature of this variability,\nwe obtained new Keck spectropolarimetry observations for seven of these\nvariable AGNs. The Keck data show that these objects have low continuum\npolarizations (p<~1% in most cases) and all seven have broad H-alpha and/or\nMgII emission lines in their total (unpolarized) spectra, indicating that they\nshould actually be classified as Type 1 AGNs.

The remnant mass fraction in the total\n(living+remnant) stellar mass of a simple stellar population monotonically\nincreases with the age of the population, and the initial mass function and\nmetallicity affect the increasing rate. Since galaxies are composed of a number\nof stellar populations, the remnant mass fraction may depend on the total\nstellar mass of galaxies in a complex way. As a result, the shape of the\nstellar mass function of galaxies may change, depending on the definition of\nthe stellar mass. In order to explore this issue, we ran a cosmological\nhydrodynamical simulation, and then, we have found that the remnant mass\nfraction indeed correlates with the total stellar mass of galaxies. However,\nthis correlation is weak and the remnant fraction can be regarded as a constant\nwhich depends only on the redshift. Therefore, the shape of the stellar mass\nfunction is almost unchanged, but it simply shifts horizontally if the remnant\nmass includes or not.

The quantum phase transition from a gapless Neel\nstate to a spin-gapped Peierls state is studied in the parameter space spanned\nby spatial anisotropy, inter-chain coupling strength and spin-lattice coupling\nstrength. It is found that for any finite inter-chain coupling, the transition\nto a dimerized Peierls ground state only occurs when the spin-lattice coupling\nexceeds a finite, non-zero critical value. This is in contrast to the pure 1D\nmodel (zero inter-chain coupling), where adiabatic/classical phonons lead to a\ndimerized ground state for any non-zero spin-phonon interaction. The phase\ndiagram in the parameter space shows that for a strong inter-chain coupling,\nthe relation between the inter-chain coupling and the critical value of the\nspin-phonon interaction is linear whereas for weak inter-chain coupling, this\nbehavior is found to have a natural logarithm-like relation. No region was\nfound to have a long range magnetic order and dimerization occurring\nsimultaneously. Instead, the Neel state order vanishes simultaneously with the\nsetting in of the spin-Peierls state. For the thermal phase transition, a\ncontinuous heat capacity with a peak at the critical temperature, $T_{c}$,\nshows a second order phase transition. The variation of the equilibrium bond\nlength distortion, $\\delta_{eq}$, with temperature showed a power law relation\nwhich decayed to zero as the temperature was increased to $T_{c}$, indicating a\ncontinuous transition from the dimerized phase to a paramagnetic phase with\nuniform bond length and zero antiferromagnetic susceptibility.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Oct 2013 02:41:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-04"}

We consider that stepwise target recognition via intermediate states\nis a characteristic of IDP binding to targets with \"hidden\" binding sites. To\ninvestigate IDP binding to hidden target binding sites, we constructed an IDP\nlattice model based on the HP model. In our model, the IDP is modeled as a\nchain and the target is modeled as a highly coarse-grained object. We\nintroduced motion and internal interactions to the target to hide its binding\nsites. In the case of unhidden binding sites, a two-state transition between\nthe free states and a bound state is observed, and we consider that this\nrepresents coupled folding and binding.

The dual of a CGP involves the maximization of the negative\nrelative entropy between two nonnegative vectors jointly, subject to affine and\nconic constraints on the two vectors. Although CGPs contain GPs and SDPs as\nspecial instances, computing global optima of CGPs is not much harder than\nsolving GPs and SDPs. More broadly, the CGP framework facilitates a range of\nnew applications that fall outside the scope of SDPs and GPs. Specifically, we\ndemonstrate the utility of CGPs in providing solutions to problems such as\npermanent maximization, hitting-time estimation in dynamical systems, the\ncomputation of the capacity of channels transmitting quantum information, and\nrobust optimization formulations of GPs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Oct 2013 05:20:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Oct 2013 03:57:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-14"}

In this situation the performance of a detector should be\nassessed on the basis of the area under the ROC curve over that range, rather\nthan over the full curve, as the performance outside the range is irrelevant.\n  This measure is labelled as the partial area under the ROC curve (pAUC).\nEffective cascade-based classification, for example, depends on training node\nclassifiers that achieve the maximal detection rate at a moderate false\npositive rate, e.g., around 40% to 50%. We propose a novel ensemble learning\nmethod which achieves a maximal detection rate at a user-defined range of false\npositive rates by directly optimizing the partial AUC using structured\nlearning. By optimizing for different ranges of false positive rates, the\nproposed method can be used to train either a single strong classifier or a\nnode classifier forming part of a cascade classifier.

This allows the detection of memory leaks and\nchecking the validity of accesses.\n  Though suited for a wide variety of programs, this approach still fails when\naccelerator based programming models are involved. The code running on these\ndevices is separate from the code running on the host. Access to memory on the\ndevice and starting of kernels is being handled by an API provided by the\ndriver being used. Hence Valgrind is unable to understand and instrument\noperations being run on the device.\n  To circumvent this limitation a new set of wrapper functions have been\nintroduced. These wrap a subset of the CUDA Driver API function that is\nresponsible for (de-)allocation memory regions on the device and the respective\nmemory copy operations. This allows to check whether memory is fully allocated\nduring a transfer and, through the functionality provided by Valgrind, whether\nthe memory transfered to the device from the host is defined and addressable.\nThrough this technique it is possible to detect a number of common programming\nmistakes, which are very difficult to debug by other means.

We use the oPBE-vdW functional which includes\nvan der Waals forces on an ab initio level. It is shown that the molecule binds\nvia its carboxyl and the hydroxyl oxygen atoms to the surface. The binding\nenergy is larger on Pt(321) and Ag(321) than on Au(321). An analysis of the\ncontributions to the binding energy of the different molecular functional\ngroups reveals that the deprotonated carboxyl group contributes most to the\nbinding energy, with a much smaller contribution of the hydroxyl group. The\nPt(321) surface shows considerable enantioselectivity of 0.06 eV. On Au(321)\nand Ag(321) it is much smaller if not vanishing. The chiral selectivity of the\nPt(321) surface can be explained by two factors. First, it derives from the\ndifference in van der Waals attraction of L- and D-lactate to the surface that\nwe trace to differences in the binding energy of the methyl group. Second, the\nmulti-point binding pattern for lactate on the Pt(321) surface is sterically\nmore sensitive to surface chirality and also leads to large binding energy\ncontributions of the hydroxyl group. We also calculate the charge transfer to\nthe molecule and the work function to gauge changes in electronic structure of\nthe adsorbed molecule.

Using empirical relationships between speed class,\nluminosity and ejection velocity, it can be shown that dust formation timescale\nis expected to be essentially independent of speed class. However, following a\nnova outburst the spectrum of the central hot source evolves, with an\nincreasing proportion of the radiation being emitted short-ward of the Lyman\nlimit. The rate at which the spectrum evolves also depends on the speed class.\nWe have therefore refined the simple model by assuming photons at energies\nhigher than the Lyman limit are absorbed by neutral hydrogen gas internal to\nthe dust formation sites, therefore preventing these photons reaching the\nnucleation sites. With this refinement the dust formation timescale is\ntheoretically dependent on speed class and the results of our theoretical\nmodification agree well with the observational data. We consider two types of\ncarbon-based dust, graphite and amorphous carbon, with both types producing\nsimilar relationships.

A necessary condition for a\nsimplicial mapping of a mesh to be injective is that it either maintains the\norientation of all elements or flips all the elements. However, these\nconditions are known to be insufficient for injectivity of a simplicial map. In\nthis paper we provide additional simple conditions that, together with the\nabove mentioned necessary conditions guarantee injectivity of the simplicial\nmap.\n  The first set of conditions generalizes classical global inversion theorems\nto the mesh (piecewise-linear) case. That is, proves that in case the boundary\nsimplicial map is bijective and the necessary condition holds then the map is\ninjective and onto the target domain. The second set of conditions is concerned\nwith mapping of a mesh to a polytope and replaces the (often hard) requirement\nof a bijective boundary map with a collection of linear constraints and\nguarantees that the resulting map is injective over the interior of the mesh\nand onto. These linear conditions provide a practical tool for optimizing a map\nof the mesh onto a given polytope while allowing the boundary map to adjust\nfreely and keeping the injectivity property in the interior of the mesh. The\nthird set of conditions adds to the second set the requirement that the\nboundary maps are orientation preserving as-well (with a proper definition of\nboundary map orientation). This set of conditions guarantees that the map is\ninjective on the boundary of the mesh as-well as its interior.

The\nfree energy of all experimentally known ice phases has been calculated with the\nflexible q-TIP4P/F model of water. The only exception is the high pressure ice\nX, in which the presence of symmetric O-H-O bonds prevents its modeling with\nthis empirical interatomic potential. The simplicity of our approach allows us\nto study ice phases at state points of the T-P plane that have been omitted in\nprevious simulations using free energy methods based on thermodynamic\nintegration. The effect in the phase diagram of averaging the proton disorder\nthat appears in several ice phases has been studied. It is found particularly\nrelevant for ice III, at least for cell sizes typically used in phase\ncoexistence simulations. New insight into the capability of the employed water\nmodel to describe the coexistence of ice phases is presented. We find that the\nH-ordered ices IX and XIV, as well as the H-disordered ice XII, are\nparticularly stable for this water model. This fact disagrees with experimental\ndata. The unexpected large stability of ice IX is a property related to the\nTIP4P-character of the water model. Only after omission of these three stable\nice phases, the calculated phase diagram becomes in reasonable qualitative\nagreement to the experimental one in the T-P region corresponding to ice Ih,\nII, III, V, and VI. The calculation of the phase diagram in the quantum and\nclassical limits shows that the most important quantum effect is the\nstabilization of ice II due to its lower zero-point energy when compared to\nthat one of ices Ih, III, and V.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Oct 2013 15:25:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-04"}

Accordingly, the\ninclusion of such effects in the LMD Mars Global Climate Model (GCM) greatly\nmodifies the simulated Martian water cycle. The intent of this paper is to\naddress the impact of radiatively active clouds on atmospheric water vapor and\nice in the GCM and improve its representation. We propose a new enhanced\nmodeling of the water cycle, consisting of detailed cloud microphysics with\ndynamic condensation nuclei and a better implementation of perennial surface\nwater ice. This physical modeling is based on tunable parameters. This new\nversion of the GCM is compared to the Thermal Emission Spectrometer\nobservations of the water cycle. Satisfying results are reached for both vapor\nand cloud opacities. However, simulations yield a lack of water vapor in the\ntropics after Ls=180{\\deg} which is persistent in simulations compared to\nobservations, as a consequence of aphelion cloud radiative effects\nstrengthening the Hadley cell. Every year, our GCM simulations indicate that\npermanent surface water ice on the north polar cap increases at latitudes\nhigher than 80{\\deg}N and decreases at lower latitudes. Supersaturation above\nthe hygropause is predicted in line with SPICAM observations. The model also\nshows for the first time that the scavenging of dust by water ice clouds alone\nfails to fully account for observed dust detached layers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Oct 2013 15:34:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Jul 2014 09:29:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-29"}

We study two containment problems related to the QCSP. Firstly,\nwe give a combinatorial condition on finite structures $\\mathcal{A}$ and\n$\\mathcal{B}$ that is necessary and sufficient to render\n$\\mathrm{QCSP}(\\mathcal{A}) \\subseteq \\mathrm{QCSP}(\\mathcal{B})$. We prove\nthat $\\mathrm{QCSP}(\\mathcal{A}) \\subseteq \\mathrm{QCSP}(\\mathcal{B})$, that is\nall sentences of positive Horn logic true on $\\mathcal{A}$ are true on\n$\\mathcal{B}$, iff there is a surjective homomorphism from\n$\\mathcal{A}^{|A|^{|B|}}$ to $\\mathcal{B}$. This can be seen as improving an\nold result of Keisler that shows the former equivalent to there being a\nsurjective homomorphism from $\\mathcal{A}^\\omega$ to $\\mathcal{B}$. We note\nthat this condition is already necessary to guarantee containment of the\n$\\Pi_2$ restriction of the QCSP, that is $\\Pi_2$-$\\mathrm{CSP}(\\mathcal{A})\n\\subseteq \\Pi_2$-$\\mathrm{CSP}(\\mathcal{B})$. The exponent's bound of\n${|A|^{|B|}}$ places the decision procedure for the model containment problem\nin non-deterministic double-exponential time complexity. We further show the\nexponent's bound $|A|^{|B|}$ to be close to tight by giving a sequence of\nstructures $\\mathcal{A}$ together with a fixed $\\mathcal{B}$, $|B|=2$, such\nthat there is a surjective homomorphism from $\\mathcal{A}^r$ to $\\mathcal{B}$\nonly when $r \\geq |A|$. Secondly, we prove that the entailment problem for\npositive Horn fragment of first-order logic is decidable. That is, given two\nsentences $\\varphi$ and $\\psi$ of positive Horn, we give an algorithm that\ndetermines whether $\\varphi \\rightarrow \\psi$ is true in all structures\n(models). Our result is in some sense tight, since we show that the entailment\nproblem for positive first-order logic (i.e. positive Horn plus disjunction) is\nundecidable. In the final part of the paper we ponder a notion of Q-core that\nis some canonical representative among the class of templates that engender the\nsame QCSP. Although the Q-core is not as well-behaved as its better known\ncousin the core, we demonstrate that it is still a useful notion in the realm\nof QCSP complexity classifications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Oct 2013 15:52:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 May 2015 14:11:33 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 10 Sep 2015 06:59:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-11"}
