In order to clarify the new\nfeatures specific to 3D models, reference 2D simulations have been carried out\nas well. Compared to the previous 2D simulations, we considered pulsar winds\nwith much stronger magnetisation, up to \\sigma=3, and accounted more accurately\nfor the anticipated magnetic dissipation in the striped zone of these winds.\nWhile the 3D models preserve the separation of the post termination shock flow\ninto the equatorial and polar components, their relative strength and\nsignificance differ. Whereas the highly magnetised 2D models produce highly\ncoherent and well collimated polar jets capable of efficient \"drilling\" through\nthe supernova shell, in the corresponding 3D models the jets are disrupted by\nthe kink mode current driven instability and \"dissolve\" into the main body of\nPWN after propagation of several shock radii. Our results show that contrary to\nthe expectations based on 1D analytical and semi-analytical models, our\nnumerical solutions with highly magnetized pulsar winds still produce\ntermination shocks with radii comparable to those deduced from the\nobservations. We present polarized synchrotron maps constructed from the 3D\nsimulations, showing that the wealth of morphological features observed with\nHubble and Chandra can well be reproduced with 3D-MHD models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Oct 2013 16:06:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

Given a finite computational resource,\nthis article addresses how to optimally divide sampling effort between the\nsamplers of the different distributions. Formally approaching this decision\nproblem requires both the specification of an error criterion to assess how\nwell each group of samples represent their underlying distribution, and a loss\nfunction to combine the errors into an overall performance score. For the first\npart, a new Monte Carlo divergence error criterion based on Jensen-Shannon\ndivergence is proposed.

Building upon the\ntheory of continuous-time invariant observers, we show that, as in the linear\ncase, the error equation is a Markov chain that does not depend on the state\nestimate. Thus, when the filter's gains are held fixed, and the filter admits\nalmost-global convergence properties with noise turned off, the noisy error's\ndistribution is proved to converge to a stationary distribution, providing\ninsight into the mathematical theory of filtering on Lie groups. For\nengineering purposes we also introduce the discrete-time Invariant Extended\nKalman Filter, for which the trusted covariance matrix is shown to\nasymptotically converge, and some numerically more involved sample-based\nmethods as well to compute the Kalman gains.

However, Swift\nobservations suggest that many GRBs have extended central engine activities\nmanifested as flares and internal plateaus in X-rays. We perform a\ncomprehensive study on a large sample of Swift GRBs with XRT observations to\ninvestigate GRB central engine activity duration and to determine whether\nultra-long GRBs are unusual events. We define burst duration t_burst based on\nboth gamma-ray and X-ray light curves rather than using gamma-ray observations\nalone. We find that t_burst can be reliably measured in 343 GRBs. Within this\n\"good\" sample, 21.9% GRBs have t_burst >=10^3 s and 11.5% GRBs have t_burst\n>=10^4 s. There is an apparent bimodal distribution of t_burst in this sample.\nHowever, when we consider an \"undetermined\" sample (304 GRBs) with t_burst\npossibly falling in the gap between GRB duration T_90 and the first X-ray\nobservational time, as well as a selection effect against t_burst falling into\nthe first Swift orbital \"dead zone\" due to observation constraints, the\nintrinsic underlying t_burst distribution is consistent with being a single\ncomponent distribution. We found that the existing evidence for a separate\nultra-long GRB population is inconclusive, and further multi-wavelength\nobservations are needed to draw a firmer conclusion. We also discuss the\ntheoretical implications of our results. In particular, the central engine\nactivity duration of GRBs is generally much longer than the gamma-ray T90\nduration and it does not even correlate with T90. It would be premature to make\na direct connection between T90 and the size of the progenitor star.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Oct 2013 16:38:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 2 Apr 2014 03:28:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-06"}

While user (near) realtime geographical information is essential to\nenable location-based social discovery in LBSNs, the importance of user\nlocation privacy has also been recognized by leading real-world LBSNs. To\nprotect user's exact geographical location from being exposed, a number of\nlocation protection approaches have been adopted by the industry so that only\nrelative location information are publicly disclosed. These techniques are\nassumed to be secure and are exercised on the daily base. In this paper, we\nquestion the safety of these location-obfuscation techniques used by existing\nLBSNs. We show, for the first time, through real world attacks that they can\nall be easily destroyed by an attacker with the capability of no more than a\nregular LBSN user. In particular, by manipulating location information fed to\nLBSN client app, an ill-intended regular user can easily deduce the exact\nlocation information by running LBSN apps as location oracle and performing a\nseries of attacking strategies. We develop an automated user location tracking\nsystem and test it on the most popular LBSNs including Wechat, Skout and Momo.\nWe demonstrate its effectiveness and efficiency via a 3 week real-world\nexperiment with 30 volunteers.

We finally demonstrate that a force-feedbacked\nnanoelectromechanical approach in which both of the C60-electrode distances are\nkept at short distances before and after switching operations can achieve a\nmetal-independent and significantly improved switching performance due to the\nFermi-level pinning in both contacts and the large intrinsic conductance\nswitching capacity of the C60 chain oligomerization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Oct 2013 17:17:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-09"}

The technique embeds the discrete channel selection problem\ninto the continuous space of predictor preweighting, then employs a\nQuasi-Newton (or other) optimization algorithm to optimize the preweighting\nvector. Once the weighting vector has been optimized, the magnitudes of the\nweights indicate the relative importance of each channel. The relative\nimportances are used to construct n different models, the kth consisting of the\nk most important channels.

When applied to time series from 39 countries,\nthis method reveals a well-defined power law in the relative per capita GDP\ncontractions that span from 5.53% to 50%, comprising 263 events. However, this\nobservation does not suffice to attribute recessions to some specific\nmechanism, such as self-organized criticality. The paper highlights a set of\npoints requiring more study so as to discriminate among models compatible with\nthe power law, as needed to develop sound tools for the management of\nrecessions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Oct 2013 18:18:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-10"}

The objects were\nidentified as SNR candidates in X-ray observations performed during the survey\nof the LMC with XMM-Newton.\n  Methods: Data obained with XMM-Newton are used to investigate the\nmorphological and spectral features of the remnants in X-rays. We measure the\nplasma conditions, look for supernova (SN) ejecta emission, and constrain some\nof the SNR properties (e.g. age and ambient density). We supplement the X-ray\ndata with optical, infrared, and radio-continuum archival observations, which\nallow us to understand the conditions resulting in the current appearance of\nthe remnants. Based on the spatially-resolved star formation history (SFH) of\nthe LMC together with the X-ray spectra, we attempt to type the supernovae that\ncreated the remnants.\n  Results: We confirm all four objects as SNRs, to which we assign the names\nMCSNR J0508-6830, MCSNR J0511-6759, MCSNR J0514-6840, and MCSNR J0517-6759. In\nthe first two remnants, an X-ray bright plasma is surrounded by very faint [S\nII] emission. The emission from the central plasma is dominated by Fe L-shell\nlines, and the derived iron abundance is greatly in excess of solar. This\nestablishes their type Ia (i.e. thermonuclear) SN origin. They appear to be\nmore evolved versions of other Magellanic Cloud iron-rich SNRs which are\ncentrally-peaked in X-rays. From the two other remnants (MCSNR J0514-6840 and\nMCSNR J0517-6759), we do not see ejecta emission. At all wavelengths at which\nthey are detected, the local environment plays a key role in their\nobservational appearance. We present evidence that MCSNR J0517-6759 is close to\nand interacting with a molecular cloud, suggesting a massive progenitor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Oct 2013 18:24:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-14"}

This paper considers\nthe combined action of stellar mass loss and tidal dissipation on planetary\norbits in order to determine the conditions required for planetary survival.\nStellar mass loss is included using a so-called Jeans model, described by a\ndimensionless mass loss rate \\gamma and an index \\beta. We use an analogous\nprescription to model tidal effects, described here by a dimensionless\ndissipation rate \\Gamma and two indices (q,p). The initial conditions are\ndetermined by the starting value of angular momentum parameter \\eta\n(equivalently, the initial eccentricity) and the phase \\theta of the orbit.\nWithin the context of this model, we derive an analytic formula for the\ncritical dissipation rate \\Gamma, which marks the boundary between orbits that\nspiral outward due to stellar mass loss and those that spiral inward due to\ntidal dissipation. This analytic result\n\\Gamma=\\Gamma(\\gamma,\\beta,q,p,\\eta,\\theta) is essentially exact for initially\ncircular orbits and holds to within an accuracy of 50% over the entire\nmulti-dimensional parameter space, where the individual parameters vary by\nseveral orders of magnitude. For stars that experience mass loss, the stellar\nradius often displays quasi-periodic variations, which produce corresponding\nvariations in tidal forcing; we generalize the calculation to include such\npulsations using a semi-analytic treatment that holds to the same accuracy as\nthe non-pulsating case.

Compression techniques dedicated to such meshes have emerged, which\nexploit the idea that the connectivity of a dense mesh does not deviate much\nfrom the connectivity that can be constructed automatically from the vertex\npositions (while possibly being guided by additional codes). The edge flip is\none of the tools that can encode the differences between two meshes, and it is\nimportant to control the length of a sequence of flips that transform one\ntriangulation into another. This paper provides a practical solution to this\nproblem. Indeed, the problem of determining a minimal sequence of edge flips\nbetween two triangulations is NP-complete for some types of triangulations\nincluding manifold triangulations of surfaces, so that it is necessary to\ndevelop heuristics. Moreover, it is sometimes difficult to establish a first\nsequence of flips between two meshes, and we advocate a solution based on the\nreduction of an existing sequence. The new approach we propose is founded on\nthe assignment of labels to identify the edges, with a property of label\ntransfer during a flip. This gives a meaning to the tracking of an edge in a\nsequence of flips and offers the exploitation of very simple combinatorial\nproperties.

Previous separate analyses of\nthese data found that they were consistent with an irradiated accretion disc\nwith contribution from either a very young or very old stellar population, and\nalso indicated that the optical flux of the HLX-1 counterpart could be\nvariable. Such variability could only be attributed to a varying accretion\ndisc, so simultaneous analysis of all data sets should break the degeneracies\nin the model fits. We thus simultaneously fit the broad-band spectral energy\ndistribution (SED) from near-infrared through to X-ray wavelengths of the two\nepochs of data with a model consisting of an irradiated accretion disc and a\nstellar population. We show that this combined analysis rules out an old\nstellar population, finding that the SED is dominated by emission from an\naccretion disc with moderate reprocessing in the outer disc around an\nintermediate mass black hole imbedded in a young (20 Myr) stellar cluster with\na mass of 1E5 Msun.

The NuSTAR data presented here represent one of the first instances of\na ULX reliably detected at hard (E>10 keV) X-rays. Circinus ULX5 is variable on\nlong timescales by at least a factor of ~5 in flux, and was caught in a\nhistorically bright state during our 2013 observations (0.3-30.0 keV luminosity\nof 1.6e40 erg/s). During this epoch, the source displayed a curved 3-10 keV\nspectrum, broadly similar to other bright ULXs. While in many cases the\ninterpretation of spectral components in ULXs is uncertain, the spectral and\ntemporal properties of the all the high quality datasets currently available\nstrongly support a simple disk-corona model reminiscent of that invoked for\nGalactic binaries, with the accretion disk becoming more prominent as the\nluminosity increases. However, although the disk temperature and luminosity are\nremarkably well correlated across all timescales currently probed, the observed\nluminosity follows T^(1.70+/-0.17), flatter than that expected for simple\nblackbody radiation. The spectral variability displayed by Circinus ULX5 is\nhighly reminiscent of that observed from some known Galactic black hole\nbinaries (BHBs) at high luminosities. This comparison would imply a black hole\nmass of ~90 Msun for Circinus ULX5. However, given the diverse behavior\nobserved from Galactic BHB accretion disks, this mass estimate is still\nuncertain.

Our\nconclusions are based on observations about the spread of diseases, which\ntravel over contact networks between individuals and whose dynamics can give us\nclues to the structure of those networks even when direct network measurements\nare not available. As an example we consider the spread of the Black Death in\n14th-century Europe, which is known to have traveled across the continent in\nwell-defined waves of infection over the course of several years.

Simulation\nresults show that the local arrangements of grain boundaries and the resulting\nstructural units have a significant influence on the magnitude of vacancy\nbinding energies, and the site-to-site variation within each boundary is\nsubstantial. Comparing the vacancy binding energies for each site in different\nc/a ratio materials shows that the binding energy increases significantly with\nan increase in c/a ratio. For example, in the [1-210] tilt axis, Ti and Zr with\nc/a=1.5811 have a lower vacancy binding energy than the Mg with c/a=1.6299.\nFurthermore, when the grain boundary energies of all 190 boundaries in all\nthree elements are plotted against the vacancy binding energies of the same\nboundaries, a highly negative correlation (r = -0.7144) is revealed that has a\nlinear fit with a proportionality constant of -25 ang^2. This is significant\nfor applications where extreme environmental damage generates lattice defects\nand grain boundaries act as sinks for both vacancies and interstitial atoms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Oct 2013 21:56:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Dec 2013 04:56:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-06"}

In both models, the\ndischarging flow-rate is determined by a recently developed model of capacity\ndrop, and the upstream in-flux is regulated by the speed limit in the VSL zone.\nSince the link queue model approximates the LWR model and is much simpler, we\nfirst analyze the control problem and develop effective VSL strategies based on\nthe former. First for an open-loop control system with a constant speed limit,\nwe prove that a constant speed limit can introduce an uncongested equilibrium\nstate, in addition to a congested one with capacity drop, but the congested\nequilibrium state is always exponentially stable. Then we apply a feedback\nproportional-integral (PI) controller to form a closed-loop control system, in\nwhich the congested equilibrium state and, therefore, capacity drop can be\nremoved by the I-controller. Both analytical and numerical results show that,\nwith appropriately chosen controller parameters, the closed-loop control system\nis stable, effect, and robust. Finally, we show that the VSL strategies based\non I- and PI-controllers are also stable, effective, and robust for the LWR\nmodel. Since the properties of the control system are transferable between the\ntwo models, we establish a dual approach for studying the control problems of\nnonlinear traffic flow systems.

For a lane-drop area, we demonstrate that the model is well-defined,\nand its Riemann problem can be uniquely solved. We theoretically discuss\ntraffic stability with this model subject to perturbations in density, upstream\ndemand, and downstream supply. We clarify that discontinuous flow-density\nrelations, or so-called \"discontinuous\" fundamental diagrams, are caused by\nincomplete observations of traffic states.

Since\na single statistical estimator can hardly be suitable to detect the various\npossible forms of non-Gaussianity, it is important to employ different\nstatistical indicators to study non-Gaussianity of CMB. This has motivated the\nproposal of a number statistical tools, including two large-angle indicators\nbased on skewness and kurtosis of spherical caps of CMB sky-sphere. Although\nsuitable to detect fairly large non-Gaussianity they are unable to detect\nnon-Gaussianity within the Planck bounds, and exhibit power spectra with\nundesirable oscillation pattern. Here we use several thousands simulated CMB\nmaps to examine interrelated problems regarding advances of these spherical\npatches procedures. We examine whether a change in the choice of the patches\ncould enhance the sensitivity of the procedures well enough to detect\nlarge-angle non-Gaussianity within the Planck bounds. To this end, a new\nstatistical procedure with non-overlapping cells is proposed and its capability\nis established. We also study whether this new procedure is capable to smooth\nout the undesirable oscillation pattern in the skewness and kurtosis power\nspectra of the spherical caps procedure. We show that the new procedure solves\nthis problem, making clear this unexpected power spectra pattern does not have\na physical origin, but rather presumably arises from the overlapping obtained\nwith the spherical caps approach. Finally, we make a comparative analysis of\nthis new statistical procedure with the spherical caps routine, determine their\nlower bounds for non-Gaussianity detection, and make apparent their relative\nstrength and sensitivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Oct 2013 00:13:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-11"}

We avoid taking asymptotic\nlimits, and focus on a practical setting where the system size is large enough\nfor many events to take place along a path, so that exact simulation of paths\nis expensive, making tau-leaping an attractive option. We use a general scaling\nof the system components that allows for the reaction rate constants and the\nabundances of species to vary over several orders of magnitude, and we exploit\nthe random time change representation developed by Kurtz.

In this\nstudy, we show that the C, Ca, and Ti isotopic anomalies are consistent with\nnucleosynthesis predictions of the H-ingestion phase during a very late thermal\npulse (VLTP) event in post-AGB stars. The low $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C isotopic ratios\nin these grains are a result of abundant $^{12}$C efficiently capturing the\nprotons that are being ingested during the VLTP. Very high neutron densities of\n$\\sim 10^{15}$ cm$^{-3}$, typical of the $i$-process, are achieved during this\nphase in post-AGB stars. The large $^{42,43,44}$Ca excesses in some graphite\ngrains are indicative of neutron capture nucleosynthesis during VLTP. The\ncomparison of VLTP nucleosynthesis calculations to the graphite data also\nindicate that apparent anomalies in the Ti isotopic ratios are due to large\ncontributions from $^{46,48}$Ca, which cannot be resolved from the isobars\n$^{46,48}$Ti during the measurements. We conclude that presolar graphite grains\nwith moderate to extreme Ca and Ti isotopic anomalies originate in post-AGB\nstars that suffer a very late thermal pulse.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Oct 2013 01:35:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

A similar upper\nbound is found for magnetic white dwarfs even though the highest magnetic field\nstrengths at their surfaces are much larger. For magnetic A and B stars there\nalso appears to be a well defined lower bound below which the incidence of\nmagnetism declines rapidly. According to recent hypotheses, both groups of\nstars may result from merging stars and owe their strong magnetism to fields\ngenerated by a dynamo mechanism as they merge. We postulate a simple dynamo\nthat generates magnetic field from differential rotation. The growth of\nmagnetic fields is limited by the requirement that the poloidal field\nstabilizes the toroidal and vice versa. While magnetic torques dissipate the\ndifferential rotation, toroidal field is generated from poloidal by an Omega\ndynamo. We further suppose that mechanisms that lead to the decay of toroidal\nfield lead to the generation of poloidal. Both poloidal and toroidal fields\nreach a stable configuration which is independent of the size of small initial\nseed fields but proportional to the initial differential rotation. We pose the\nhypothesis that strongly magnetic stars form from the merging of two stellar\nobjects. The highest fields are generated when the merge introduces\ndifferential rotation that amounts to critical break up velocity within the\ncondensed object. Calibration of a simplistic dynamo model with the observed\nmaximum flux per unit mass for main-sequence stars and white dwarfs indicates\nthat about 1.5x10^-4 of the decaying toroidal flux must appear as poloidal. The\nhighest fields in single white dwarfs are generated when two degenerate cores\nmerge inside a common envelope or when two white dwarfs merge by\ngravitational-radiation angular momentum loss.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Oct 2013 03:32:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

Dynamic Quantum Clustering (DQC) is such a methodology. DQC is a\npowerful visual method that works with big, high-dimensional data. It exploits\nvariations of the density of the data (in feature space) and unearths subsets\nof the data that exhibit correlations among all the measured variables. The\noutcome of a DQC analysis is a movie that shows how and why sets of data-points\nare eventually classified as members of simple clusters or as members of - what\nwe call - extended structures. This allows DQC to be successfully used in a\nnon-conventional exploratory mode where one searches data for unexpected\ninformation without the need to model the data. We show how this works for big,\ncomplex, real-world datasets that come from five distinct fields: i.e., x-ray\nnano-chemistry, condensed matter, biology, seismology and finance. These\nstudies show how DQC excels at uncovering unexpected, small - but meaningful -\nsubsets of the data that contain important information. We also establish an\nimportant new result: namely, that big, complex datasets often contain\ninteresting structures that will be missed by many conventional clustering\ntechniques. Experience shows that these structures appear frequently enough\nthat it is crucial to know they can exist, and that when they do, they encode\nimportant hidden information. In short, we not only demonstrate that DQC can be\nflexibly applied to datasets that present significantly different challenges,\nwe also show how a simple analysis can be used to look for the needle in the\nhaystack, determine what it is, and find what this means.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Oct 2013 04:00:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Oct 2013 21:06:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-21"}

It is also assumed\nthat as the temperature of the surrounding environment increases, so the\nefficiency of processes such as quantum tunnelling drops. One way of viewing\nthis has been to invoke the quantum Zeno effect: that the watched pot never\nboils. In this work we show that the opposite is true. For a quite general open\nquantum system, a proton in an asymmetric double-well potential, the action of\nthe environment is to enhance the tunnelling rate (an anti-Zeno effect). We\ncompare two simple mathematical models to show that, over a specific\ntemperature range, thermally enhanced quantum tunnelling is equivalent to\nincreasing the frequency of a von Neumann-type measurement by the environment\non the system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Oct 2013 09:15:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-09"}

It is difficult\nto estimate to what extent the vorticity self-organization (a purely kinematic\nprocess) have influenced the characteristics of the tropical cyclone at\nstationarity.

The secondary constraint p^i,_i=0 still holds,\nbut being a function of derivatives of momenta (mere auxiliary fields), it is\nnot directly about the observable electric field (a function of derivatives of\nA), which couples to charge. Only a special combination of the two first-class\nconstraints, the Anderson-Bergmann-Castellani gauge generator G, leaves E\nunchanged. Likewise only that combination leaves the canonical action\ninvariant---an argument independent of observables. If one uses a first-class\nconstraint to generate instead a canonical transformation, one partly strips\nthe canonical coordinates of physical meaning as electromagnetic potentials,\nvindicating the Anderson-Bergmann Lagrangian orientation of interesting\ncanonical transformations. The need to keep gauge-invariant q,t-dH/dp=-E-p=0\nsupports using the gauge generator and primary Hamiltonian rather than the\nseparate first-class constraints and the extended Hamiltonian.\n  Partly paralleling Pons's criticism, it is shown that Dirac's proof that a\nfirst-class primary constraint generates a gauge transformation, by comparing\nevolutions from _identical_ initial data, cancels out and hence fails to detect\nthe alterations made to the initial state. It also neglects the arbitrary\ncoordinates multiplying the secondary constraints _inside_ the canonical\nHamiltonian. Thus the gauge-generating property has been ascribed to the\nprimaries alone.\n  Hence the Dirac conjecture about secondary first-class constraints as\ngenerating gauge transformations rests upon a false presupposition about\nprimary first-class constraints. Clarity about electromagnetism help with GR.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Oct 2013 10:22:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 3 Oct 2014 19:05:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-10"}

We obtain analytical\nexpressions for key performance metrics at the relay, such as arrival and\nservice rates, stability conditions, and average queue length, as functions of\nthe transmission probabilities, the self interference coefficient, and the\nlinks' outage probabilities. Furthermore, we study the impact of the relay node\nand the self-interference coefficient on the per-user and aggregate throughput,\nand the average delay per packet. We show that perfect self-interference\ncancelation plays a crucial role when the SINR threshold is small, since it may\nresult to worse performance in throughput and delay comparing with the\nhalf-duplex case. This is because perfect self-interference cancelation can\ncause an unstable queue at the relay under some conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Oct 2013 11:14:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 21 Oct 2013 21:43:41 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 23 Mar 2014 16:59:36 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 30 Jan 2015 10:39:34 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 26 Feb 2015 18:02:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

We perform\nthree-dimensional, time-dependent, multi-frequency radiative transfer\nsimulations for radioactively powered emission from the ejecta of black hole\n(BH) - neutron star (NS) mergers. Depending on the BH to NS mass ratio, spin of\nthe BH, and equations of state of dense matter, BH-NS mergers can eject more\nmaterial than NS-NS mergers. In such cases, radioactively powered emission from\nthe BH-NS merger ejecta can be more luminous than that from NS-NS mergers. We\nshow that, in spite of the expected larger distances to BH-NS merger events,\nobserved brightness of BH-NS mergers can be comparable to or even higher than\nthat of NS-NS mergers. We find that, when the tidally disrupted BH-NS merger\nejecta are confined to a small solid angle, the emission from BH-NS merger\nejecta tends to be bluer than that from NS-NS merger ejecta for a given total\nluminosity. Thanks to this property, we might be able to distinguish BH-NS\nmerger events from NS-NS merger events by multi-band observations of the\nradioactively powered emission. In addition to the GW observations, such\nelectromagnetic observations can potentially provide independent information on\nthe nature of compact binary coalescences.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Oct 2013 11:17:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

For this study, we\nalso used EUV images from Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) and magnetograms\nfrom Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) onboard Solar Dynamics Observatory,\nand multi-channel microwave data from Nobeyama Radiopolarimeters (NoRP) and\nKorean Solar Radio Burst Locator (KSRBL). We traced centroids of the microwave\nsource observed by NoRH 17 GHz during the flare and found two episodes of the\nmotion with several facts: 1) The microwave source moved systematically along\nthe flare-arcade, which was observed by the AIA 94 A in a direction parallel to\nthe neutral line. 2) The period of each episode was 5 min and 14 min,\nrespectively. 3) Estimated parallel speed was 34 km/s for the first episode and\n22 km/s for the second episode. The spectral slope of microwave flux above 10\nGHz obtained by NoRP and KSRBL was negative for both episodes, and for the last\nphase of the second episodes, it was flat with the flux of 150 sfu. The\nnegative spectrum and the flat with high flux indicate that the gyrosynchrotron\nemission from accelerated electrons was dominant during the source motions. The\nsequential images from the AIA 304 A and 94 A channels revealed that there were\nsuccessive plasma eruptions and each eruption was initiated just before the\nstart time of the microwave sources motion. Based on the results, we suggest\nthat the microwave source motion manifests the displacement of the particle\nacceleration site caused by plasma eruptions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Oct 2013 12:41:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

Recent work on max-margin supervised topic models\nhas successfully integrated it with Bayesian topic models to discover\ndiscriminative latent semantic structures and make accurate predictions for\nunseen testing data. However, the resulting learning problems are usually hard\nto solve because of the non-smoothness of the margin loss. Existing approaches\nto building max-margin supervised topic models rely on an iterative procedure\nto solve multiple latent SVM subproblems with additional mean-field assumptions\non the desired posterior distributions. This paper presents an alternative\napproach by defining a new max-margin loss. Namely, we present Gibbs max-margin\nsupervised topic models, a latent variable Gibbs classifier to discover hidden\ntopic representations for various tasks, including classification, regression\nand multi-task learning. Gibbs max-margin supervised topic models minimize an\nexpected margin loss, which is an upper bound of the existing margin loss\nderived from an expected prediction rule. By introducing augmented variables\nand integrating out the Dirichlet variables analytically by conjugacy, we\ndevelop simple Gibbs sampling algorithms with no restricting assumptions and no\nneed to solve SVM subproblems. Furthermore, each step of the\n\"augment-and-collapse\" Gibbs sampling algorithms has an analytical conditional\ndistribution, from which samples can be easily drawn. Experimental results\ndemonstrate significant improvements on time efficiency. The classification\nperformance is also significantly improved over competitors on binary,\nmulti-class and multi-label classification tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Oct 2013 13:47:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-11"}

However, although interesting results have been\nachieved, the methods require the underlying polytope to have very restrictive\nproperties (half-integrality and persistence), which are known only for few\nproblems (essentially Vertex Cover (Nemhauser and Trotter, 1975) and Node\nMultiway Cut (Garg et al., 1994)).

The best way to obtain the necessary data is via very high resolution\nground-based spectrography. Such observations measure the perceived\nradial-velocity shifts that arise due to stellar oscillations, which exhibit a\nmuch better signal-to-noise ratio than those for intensity observations.

Oxygen sequence Wolf-Rayet (WO) stars are thought to represent the\nfinal evolutionary stage of the most massive stars. The characteristic strong O\nvi emission possibly originates from an enhanced oxygen abundance in the\nstellar wind. Alternatively, the O vi emission can be caused by the high\ntemperature of these stars, in which case the WO stars are the high-temperature\nextension of the more common carbon sequence Wolf-Rayet (WC) stars. Aims. By\nconstraining the physical properties and evolutionary status of DR1, a WO star\nin the low-metallicity Local Group dwarf galaxy IC 1613 and one of only two\nobjects of its class known in a SMC-like metallicity environment, we aim to\ninvestigate the nature of WO stars and their evolutionary connection with WC\nstars. Methods. We use the non-LTE atmosphere code cmfgen to model the observed\nspectrum of DR1 and to derive its stellar and wind parameters. We compare our\nvalues with other studies of WC and WO stars, as well as with the predictions\nof evolutionary models. We also model the surrounding nebula using the\nphoto-ionization code cloudy. Results. The oxygen and carbon abundances that we\nobtain are comparable to values found for WC stars. The temperature and\nluminosity are, however, higher than those of WC stars. DR1 is embedded in the\nhottest known H ii region in the Local Group. The nebular properties can be\nconsistently reproduced by cloudy models adopting DR1 as central ionizing\nsource. Conclusions. Comparison of the abundances and temperature of DR1 with\ncore helium-burning models show that DR1 is currently well into the second half\nof helium burning. If the properties of DR1 are representative for the WO\nclass, it would imply that WO stars are the high-temperature and\nhigh-luminosity extension of the WC stars, and do not necessarily represent a\nlater evolutionary stage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Oct 2013 15:08:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

In this work, we studied the\nevolution of plasma heating after the CME of 2004 July 28 by comparing UV\nspectra acquired by UVCS with soft X-ray (SXR) and hard X-ray (HXR)images of\nthe post-flare loops taken by GOES/SXI and RHESSI. The X-ray data show a\nlong-lasting extended source that is rising upwards, toward the\nhigh-temperature source detected by UVCS. UVCS data show the presence of\nsignificant non-thermal broadening in the CS (signature of turbulent motions)\nand a strong density gradient across the CS region. The thermal energy released\nin the HXR source is on the order of about 10^32 erg, a factor about 2-5 larger\nthan the energy required to explain the high-temperature plasma sampled by\nUVCS. Nevertheless, the very different time evolutions of SXR and HXR sources\ncompared to the UV emission suggest that reconnection occurring above the\npost-eruption arcades are not directly responsible for the high-temperature\nplasma sampled higher up by UVCS. We conclude that an additional plasma heating\nmechanism (such as turbulent reconnection) in the CS is likely required.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Oct 2013 15:17:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

Then, it is important to\ndevelop a method to avoid the phase transition by introducing a new type of\nfluctuation. By taking the Potts model for instance, we review a way to change\nthe phase transition nature. Although the method described in this paper does\nnot succeed to avoid the phase transition, we believe that the concept of the\nmethod will be useful for optimization problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Oct 2013 08:35:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-23"}

This model\nincorporates a shape prior of the white matter anatomy and the likelihood of\nindividual observed HARDI datasets. We first assume that the atlas is generated\nfrom a known hyperatlas through a flow of diffeomorphisms and its shape prior\ncan be constructed based on the framework of large deformation diffeomorphic\nmetric mapping (LDDMM). LDDMM characterizes a nonlinear diffeomorphic shape\nspace in a linear space of initial momentum uniquely determining diffeomorphic\ngeodesic flows from the hyperatlas. Therefore, the shape prior of the HARDI\natlas can be modeled using a centered Gaussian random field (GRF) model of the\ninitial momentum. In order to construct the likelihood of observed HARDI\ndatasets, it is necessary to study the diffeomorphic transformation of\nindividual observations relative to the atlas and the probabilistic\ndistribution of orientation distribution functions (ODFs). To this end, we\nconstruct the likelihood related to the transformation using the same\nconstruction as discussed for the shape prior of the atlas. The probabilistic\ndistribution of ODFs is then constructed based on the ODF Riemannian manifold.\nWe assume that the observed ODFs are generated by an exponential map of random\ntangent vectors at the deformed atlas ODF. Hence, the likelihood of the ODFs\ncan be modeled using a GRF of their tangent vectors in the ODF Riemannian\nmanifold. We solve for the maximum a posteriori using the\nExpectation-Maximization algorithm and derive the corresponding update\nequations. Finally, we illustrate the HARDI atlas constructed based on a\nChinese aging cohort of 94 adults and compare it with that generated by\naveraging the coefficients of spherical harmonics of the ODF across subjects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Oct 2013 00:32:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-14"}
