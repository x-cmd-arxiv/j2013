We found Cen X-4 to be highly variable in all\nenergy bands on timescales from days to months, with the strongest quiescent\nvariability a factor of 22 drop in the X-ray count rate in only 4 days. The\nX-ray, UV and optical (V band) emission are correlated on timescales down to\nless than 110 s. The shape of the correlation is a power law with index gamma\nabout 0.2-0.6. The X-ray spectrum is well fitted by a hydrogen NS atmosphere\n(kT=59-80 eV) and a power law (with spectral index Gamma=1.4-2.0), with the\nspectral shape remaining constant as the flux varies. Both components vary in\ntandem, with each responsible for about 50% of the total X-ray flux, implying\nthat they are physically linked. We conclude that the X-rays are likely\ngenerated by matter accreting down to the NS surface. Moreover, based on the\nshort timescale of the correlation, we also unambiguously demonstrate that the\nUV emission can not be due to either thermal emission from the stream impact\npoint, or a standard optically thick, geometrically thin disc. The spectral\nenergy distribution shows a small UV emitting region, too hot to arise from the\naccretion disk, that we identified as a hot spot on the companion star.\nTherefore, the UV emission is most likely produced by reprocessing from the\ncompanion star, indeed the vertical size of the disc is small and can only\nreprocess a marginal fraction of the X-ray emission. We also found the\naccretion disc in quiescence to likely be UV faint, with a minimal contribution\nto the whole UV flux.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Oct 2013 16:10:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

However, they can\nbe attributed to the line of sight projection of the edges of coronal mass\nejections. Therefore, the altitude estimation of these features is crucial to\ndiscriminate in favor of one of these two interpretations. We take advantage of\na set of observations obtained from two different points of view by\nEUVI/SECCHI/STEREO on December, 7th 2007 to derive the time evolution of the\naltitude of a coronal wave front. We develop a new technique to compute the\naltitude.\n  We find that the observed brightness has an increasing altitude during 5\nminutes, then the altitude decreases slightly back to the low corona. We\ninterpret the evolution of the altitude as following: the increase of altitude\nof the wave front is linked to the rise of a bubble like structure whether it\nis a magnetosonic wave front or a CME in the first phase. During the second\nphase, the observed brightness is mixed with the brightening of the underlying\nmagnetic structures as the emission of the plasma of the wave front fades due\nto the plasma dilution with the altitude.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Oct 2013 16:15:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

Heat capacity measurements establish that the\nreduction of T_N with Gd substitution is much less as compared to that by Y\nsubstitution. The magnetic moment data reveal that there are changes in the\noxidation state of Co as well, unlike for Y-substitution, beyond x= 0.2. Thus,\ndespite being isovalent, both these substitutions interestingly differ in\nchanging these magnetic properties in these oxides. We propose that the valence\nelectrons of Y and those of R ions play different roles on deciding these\nmagnetic characteristics of these mixed oxides. It is observed that a small\namount (x= 0.3) of Gd substitution for Ca is enough to suppress glassy ac\nmagnetic susceptibility behavior for the peak around 12 K. An additional\nlow-temperature magnetic anomaly close to 5 K gets more prominent with\nincreasing Gd concentration as revealed by heat-capacity data. Trends in\ntemperature dependence of complex dielectric behavior were also tracked with\nvarying composition and a frequency dependence is observed, not only for the\ntransition in the region around 10 K (for some compositions), but also for the\n5 K transition which is well-resolved for a higher concentration of Gd.

A simple analytical model for the two-wind\ninteraction dynamics was developed accounting for the lifetime of clumps under\nthe pulsar-wind impact. This time plays a very important role with regard to\nthe evolution of the clump, the magnetic field in the clump-pulsar wind\ninteraction region, and the non-radiative and radiative cooling of the\nnon-thermal particles. We also computed the high-energy emission produced at\nthe interaction of long-living clumps with the pulsar wind. For reasonable\nparameters, the clumps will induce small variability on the X-ray and gamma-ray\nradiation. Sporadically, large clumps can reach closer to the pulsar increasing\nthe magnetic field, triggering synchrotron X-ray flares and weakening other\nemission components like inverse Compton. The reduction of the emitter size\ninduced by clumps also makes non-radiative losses faster. Stellar wind clumps\ncan also enhance instability development and matter entrainment in the shocked\npulsar wind when it leaves the binary. Growth limitations of the clumps from\nthe wind acceleration region may imply that a different origin for the largest\nclumps is required. The large-scale wind structures behind the observed\ndiscrete absorption components in the UV may be the source of these large\nclumps. The presence of structure in the stellar wind can produce substantial\nenergy-dependent variability and should not be neglected when studying the\nbroadband emission from high-mass binaries hosting young pulsars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Oct 2013 16:57:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Nov 2013 14:38:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

Suppose a partial\nfunction is given from one such space into another one whose selected base has\na recursively enumerable index set, and suppose that the intersection of base\nopen sets in the first space is computable in the sense of Weihrauch-Grubba.\nThen the ordinary TTE computability of the function is characterized by the\nexistence of an appropriate recursively enumerable relation between indices of\nbase sets containing the argument value and indices of base sets containing the\ncorresponding function value.This result can be regarded as an improvement of a\nresult of Korovina and Kudinov. The second way is applicable to metric spaces\nwith selected indexed denumerable dense subsets. If a partial function is given\nfrom one such space into another one, then, under a semi-computability\nassumption concerning these spaces, the ordinary TTE computability of the\nfunction is characterized by the existence of an appropriate recursively\nenumerable set of quadruples.

We provide a\ndefinition together with a simplification, denoted sLTCs, for the special case\nof stabilizer codes, together with some basic results using those definitions.\nThe most crucial parameter of such codes is their soundness, $R(\\delta)$,\nnamely, the probability that a randomly chosen constraint is violated as a\nfunction of the distance of a word from the code ($\\delta$, the relative\ndistance from the code, is called the proximity). We then proceed to study\nlimitations on qLTCs. In our first main result we prove a surprising,\ninherently quantum, property of sLTCs: for small values of proximity, the\nbetter the small-set expansion of the interaction graph of the constraints, the\nless sound the qLTC becomes. This phenomenon, which can be attributed to\nmonogamy of entanglement, stands in sharp contrast to the classical setting.\nThe complementary, more intuitive, result also holds: an upper bound on the\nsoundness when the code is defined on poor small-set expanders (a bound which\nturns out to be far more difficult to show in the quantum case). Together we\narrive at a quantum upper-bound on the soundness of stabilizer qLTCs set on any\ngraph, which does not hold in the classical case. Many open questions are\nraised regarding what possible parameters are achievable for qLTCs. In the\nappendix we also define a quantum analogue of PCPs of proximity (PCPPs) and\npoint out that the result of Ben-Sasson et. al. by which PCPPs imply LTCs with\nrelated parameters, carries over to the sLTCs.

Correspondence limits are discussed, in\nthe presence of such new interactions, for both small black holes and large\nones; the near-horizon description of the latter is approximately that of\nRindler space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Oct 2013 20:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 Nov 2013 22:28:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-02"}

The prescription leads to\nconsistent SFR estimates and reproduces the observed relation between the\nHalpha/UV luminosity ratio and visual extinction, both on a pixel-by-pixel and\non a galaxy-integrated level. We find the surface density of star formation to\ncorrelate with the surface density of assembled stellar mass for spatially\nresolved regions within galaxies, akin to the so-called 'main sequence of star\nformation' established on a galaxy-integrated level. Deviations from this\nrelation towards lower equivalent widths are found in the inner regions of\ngalaxies. Clumps and spiral features, on the other hand, are associated with\nenhanced Halpha equivalent widths, bluer colors, and higher specific star\nformation rates compared to the underlying disk. Their Halpha/UV luminosity\nratio is lower than that of the underlying disk, suggesting the ACS clump\nselection preferentially picks up those regions of elevated star formation\nactivity that are the least obscured by dust.

Such intermittent response resembles\nthe behavior of earthquakes or contact depinning, where a well-defined\nlandscape of pinning disorder prohibits the deformation of an elastic medium.\nNevertheless, a disordered solid is evidently different in that pinning\nbarriers of particles are due to neighbors that are also subject to motion.\nMicroscopic yielding leads to destruction of the local microstructure and local\nheating. It is natural to assume that locally a liquid emerges for a finite\ntimescale before cooling down to a transformed configuration. For including\nthis characteristic transient in glass depinning models, we propose a general\nmechanism that involves a \"pin-delay\" time Tpd, during which each region that\nslipped evolves as a fluid.

Such constraints are independent of\nthe radial velocity (RV) analysis recently performed by Weiss and coworkers,\nand valuable in examining the reliability of the parameter estimate using TTVs.\nWe numerically fit the observed TTVs of KOI-94c, KOI-94d, and KOI-94e for their\nmasses, eccentricities, and longitudes of periastrons, and obtain the best-fit\nparameters including $m_{\\rm c} = 9.4_{-2.1}^{+2.4} M_{\\oplus}$, $m_{\\rm d} =\n52.1_{-7.1}^{+6.9} M_{\\oplus}$, $m_{\\rm e} = 13.0_{-2.1}^{+2.5} M_{\\oplus}$,\nand $e \\lesssim 0.1$ for all the three planets. While these values are mostly\nin agreement with the RV result, the mass of KOI-94d estimated from the TTV is\nsignificantly smaller than the RV value $m_{\\rm d} = 106 \\pm 11 M_{\\oplus}$. In\naddition, we find that the TTV of the outermost planet KOI-94e is not well\nreproduced in the current modeling. We also present analytic modeling of the\nPPE and derive a simple formula to reconstruct the mutual inclination of the\ntwo planets from the observed height, central time, and duration of the\nbrightening caused by the PPE. Based on this model, the implication of the\nresults of TTV analysis for the time of the next PPE is discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Oct 2013 01:30:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Nov 2013 12:35:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-15"}

A relativistic profile is required over a single Gaussian\nline from any charge state of Fe at the 5-sigma level of confidence, and any\ntwo Gaussians of equal width at the same confidence. The Compton\nback-scattering \"hump\" peaking in the 10-20 keV band is detected for the first\ntime in a neutron star X-ray binary. Fits with relativistically-blurred disk\nreflection models suggest that the disk likely extends close to the innermost\nstable circular orbit (ISCO) or stellar surface. The best-fit blurred\nreflection models constrain the gravitational redshift from the stellar surface\nto be z > 0.16.

To describe the structure of these phenomena one\nneeds information on the magnetic flux density and the electric current density\nvector components in three dimensions throughout the atmosphere. However,\ncurrent spectro-polarimetric measurements typically limit the determination of\nthe vector magnetic field only to the photosphere. Therefore, there is\nconsiderable interest in accurate modeling of the solar coronal magnetic field\nusing photospheric vector magnetograms as boundary data. In this work, we model\nthe coronal magnetic field for global solar atmosphere using a nonlinear\nforce-free field(NLFFF) extrapolation codes implemented to a synoptic maps of\nphotospheric vector magnetic field synthesized from Vector Spectromagnetograph\n(VSM) on Synoptic Optical Long-term Investigations of the Sun (SOLIS) as\nboundary condition. Using the resulting three dimensional magnetic field, we\ncalculate the three dimensional electric current density and free magnetic\nenergy throughout the solar atmosphere for Carrington rotation 2124. We found\nthat spatially, the low-lying, current-carrying core field demonstrates strong\nconcentration of free energy in the AR core, from the photosphere to the lower\ncorona; the coronal field becomes slightly more sheared in the lowest layer and\nit relaxes to the potential field configuration with height. The free energy\ndensity appears largely co-spatial with the electric current distribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Oct 2013 03:29:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

We discuss methods of calculations of these averages using both the\nmean-field and the pair-cluster approximation to describe influence of\nvacancy-solute and solute-solute interactions, and both the nearest-neighbor\nand the second-shell approximation to describe vacancy correlation effects. The\nmethods developed are used for calculations of enhancement factors which\ndetermine the concentration dependence of tracer self-diffusion and tracer\nsolute diffusion in dilute FCC alloys. For the tracer self-diffusion, we show\nthat some significant contribution to the enhancement factor related to the\nthermodynamic activity of vacancies was missed in the previous treatments of\nthis problem. It implies that the most of existing estimates of parameters of\nthe five-frequency model for real alloys should be revised. For the tracer\nsolute diffusion, the expression for the enhancement factor seems to be\npresented for the first time. The results obtained are used to estimate the\nmicroscopic parameters important for diffusion, including the vacancy-solute\ninteraction, in several FCC alloys for which necessary experimental data are\navailable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Oct 2013 06:18:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 25 Oct 2013 15:17:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-28"}

The connectivity of polymeric bicontinuous structures makes them\nhighly desirable for many applications. For conventional monodisperse diblock\nand triblock copolymers, regular bicontinuous structures (i.e., gyroid and\nFddd) can be formed over a narrow composition window of ~3%.

For suitable L, the functions $\\alpha$ and\n$\\beta$ can be chosen depending on any natural number m such that H admits an\nextra polynomial first integral in the momenta of degree m, explicitly\ndetermined in the form of the m-th power of a differential operator applied to\na certain function of coordinates and momenta. In particular, if L is maximally\nsuperintegrable (MS) then H is MS also. Therefore, the extension procedure\nallows the creation of new superintegrable systems from old ones. For m=2, the\nextra first integral generated by the extension procedure determines a\nsecond-order symmetry operator of a Laplace-Beltrami quantization of H,\nmodified by taking in account the curvature of the configuration manifold.

The new numerical method\nconsists of two parts. We first search for modes resonant with a prescribed\nforcing symmetry by moving through relevant regions of complex frequency space\nand monitoring any increase of the stellar response to the applied forcing and\nzooming in onto the resonance. These resonant non-adiabatic 2D-solutions are\nthen fed into a 2D relaxation code with the same equations but without forcing\nterms.

The model is based on a three-component nonlinear system of\ntwo-dimensional partial differential equations for fluid, glucose and albumin\ntransport with the relevant boundary and initial conditions. Its aim is to\nmodel ultrafiltration of water combined with inflow of glucose to the tissue\nand removal of albumin from the body during dialysis, and it does this by\nfinding the spatial distributions of glucose and albumin concentrations and\nhydrostatic pressure. The model is developed in one spatial dimension\napproximation and a governing equation for each of the variables is derived\nfrom physical principles. Under certain assumptions the model are simplified\nwith the aim of obtaining exact formulae for spatially non-uniform steady-state\nsolutions.\n  As the result, the exact formulae for the fluid fluxes from blood to tissue\nand across the tissue are constructed together with two linear autonomous ODEs\nfor glucose and albumin concentrations in the tissue. The obtained analytical\nresults are checked for their applicability for the description of\nfluid-glucose-albumin transport during peritoneal dialysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Oct 2013 10:54:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-08"}

This observed plateau phase was believed to be due to\na continued energy injection mechanism which powered the forward shock, giving\nrise to an unusual and long-lasting afterglow.

This process can\nhappen if the initial mass of the cluster exceeds a threshold above which\nejecta are retained and a second generation is formed. A determination of this\nmass-threshold is mandatory in order to understand how GCs form. We analyzed 9\nRGB stars belonging to the cluster Ruprecht 106. Targets were observed with the\nUVES@VLT2 spectrograph. Spectra cover a wide range and allowed us to measure\nabundances for light (O,Na,Mg,Al), alpha (Si,Ca,Ti), iron-peak\n(Sc,V,Cr,Mn,Fe,Co,Ni,Cu,Zn) and neutron-capture\n(Y,Zr,Ba,La,Ce,Pr,Nd,Sm,Eu,Dy,Pb) elements.

This result is supported also by an independent photometric test and by\nthe HB morphology and the dynamical state. It is old (~12 Gyrs) and, at odds\nwith other GCs, has no alpha-enhancement. The material it formed from was\ncontaminated by both s- and r- process elements. The abundance pattern points\ntoward an extragalactic origin.

Accordingly, accurately estimating the\nstatistical properties of such flows is necessary for developing a\ncomprehensive understanding of turbulence. We develop and employ a hierarchical\nBayesian fitting method to estimate the parameters describing the scaling\nrelationships of the velocity power spectra of supersonic turbulence. We\ndemonstrate the accuracy and other advantages of this technique compared with\nordinary linear regression methods. Using synthetic power spectra, we show that\nthe Bayesian method provides accurate parameter and error estimates. Commonly\nused normal linear regression methods can provide estimates that fail to\nrecover the underlying slopes, up to 70% of the instances, even when\nconsidering the 2std.dev. uncertainties. Additionally, we apply the Bayesian\nmethods to analyse the statistical properties of compressible turbulence in 3D\nnumerical simulations. We model driven, isothermal, turbulence with rms Mach\nnumbers in the highly supersonic regime M~15. We study the influence of purely\nsolenoidal (divergence-free) and purely compressive (curl-free) forcing on the\nscaling exponent of the power spectrum. In simulations with solenoidal forcing\nand 1024^3 resolution, our results indicate that there is no extended inertial\nrange with a constant scaling exponent.

The sample space of such walks with $n$ edges is the\n$(2n-3)$-dimensional Riemannian manifold of equilateral closed polygons in\n$\\mathbb{R}^3$. We study closed random walks using the symplectic geometry of\nthe $(2n-6)$-dimensional quotient of the manifold of polygons by the action of\nthe rotation group $\\operatorname {SO}(3)$. The basic objects of study are the\nmoment maps on equilateral random polygon space given by the lengths of any\n$(n-3)$-tuple of nonintersecting diagonals.

The Green's function approach is applied to obtain the energy spectrum of\nquasi-particle excitations responsible for thermal transport.

In most of the existing literature, either Bayesian or\nnon-Bayesian, the decision rules mainly focus on the validity of the test\nprocedure rather than actually utilizing the dependency to increase efficiency.\nMoreover, the decisions regarding different hypotheses are marginal in the\nsense that they do not depend upon each other directly. However, in realistic\nsituations, the hypotheses are usually dependent, and hence it is desirable\nthat the decisions regarding the dependent hypotheses are taken jointly.\n  In this article we develop a novel Bayesian multiple testing procedure that\ncoherently takes this requirement into consideration. Our method, which is\nbased on new notions of error and non-error terms, substantially enhances\nefficiency by judicious exploitation of the dependence structure among the\nhypotheses.

Gain control through\nnoisy input has been observed in vitro and in a range of computational models.\nWe investigate the behaviour of the simplest of such models to showcase gain\ncontrol, a stochastic leaky integrate-and-fire (sLIF) neuron, which exhibits\ngain control through divisive normalisation of the input both with and without\naccompanying subtractive shift of the input-response curve, depending on\nwhether input noise is proportional to or independent of its mean.

This analytic approximation qualitatively produces\nthe same behaviour as simulations and could be extended by spectrotemporally\ntuned inputs to give a simple, physiological and local mechanism of contrast\ngain control in auditory sensing, building on recent experimental work that has\nhitherto only been described by phenomenological models.

The calculations require to utilize massively parallel\ngraphics processor units (GPUs) for efficient and exact computations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Oct 2013 22:09:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-13"}

A polarimeter based on the asymmetry in the\nspacial distribution of the spin light component of synchrotron radiation will\nmake for a fine addition to the existing-conventional M{\\o}ller and Compton\npolarimeters. The spin light polarimeter consists of a set of wriggler magnet\nalong the beam that generate synchrotron radiation. The spacial distribution of\nsynchrotron radiation will be measured by an ionization chamber after being\ncollimated. The up-down spacial asymmetry in the transverse plane is used to\nquantify the polarization of the beam. As a part of the design process,\nfirstly, a rough calculation was drawn out to establish the validity of such an\nidea. Secondly, the fringe fields of the wriggler magnet was simulated using a\n2-D magnetic field simulation toolkit called Poisson Superfish, which is\nmaintained by Los Alamos National Laboratory. This was used to account for beam\nmotion effects and the corresponding correlations were show to be negligible.\nLastly, a full fledged GEANT-4 simulation was built to study the response time\nof the ionization chamber. This GEANT-4 simulation was analyzed for variety of\neffects that may hinder precision polarimetry. It was found that a Spin-Light\nPolarimeter would be a fine relative polarimeter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Oct 2013 13:22:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Apr 2015 01:36:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-16"}

The\nproblem is represented in the framework of Greek epic poetry and structured in\na didactic way. Owing to the characteristic properties of Lorenz\ntransformations, three events which are simultaneous in a given inertial\nreference system, occur at different times in the other two reference frames.\nIn contrast to the famous twin paradox, in the present case there are three,\nnot two, different inertial observers. This feature provides a better framework\nto expose some of the main characteristics of SRT, in particular, the concept\nof velocity and the relativistic rule of addition of velocities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Oct 2013 10:00:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-25"}

Impedance\nmeasurements are one most used technique available to study material properties\nas well as electromagnetic devices and circuits. This way, novelties on device\nconstruction and circuit technology associated to new material properties\nand/or unusual field dynamics generally rely on results supported by impedance\ndata. Recent advances on nanostructured materials explore astounding molecular\nproperties derived from nanoscale levels and apply them to studies foucused on\nthe generation of new devices. Accordingly, properties inherent to quantum\ndynamics can also generate unusual circuit elements, not included on the former\ndevelopment of the electromagnetic theory. On same footings, advances in field\ndynamics could also determine the advent of new technologies, producing\nimmediate impact on our everyday life. In this work we present the results\nobtained by measuring the impedance of single spires and coils of specific\ngeometry in the MHz range. They demonstrate that a new passive circuit element\nwas found, which bears out the existence of an as yet unobserved propagation\nmode of the electromagnetic fields in matter. Our results also indicates that\nthis effect is more evident using carbon made spires.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Oct 2013 14:58:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-31"}
