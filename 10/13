In this work we explore the effect of sequence flexibility on\ntranscription factor-mediated DNA looping, by drawing on sequences identified\nin nucleosome formation and ligase-mediated cyclization assays as being\nespecially favorable for or resistant to large deformations. We examine a\npoly(dA:dT)-rich, nucleosome-repelling sequence that is often thought to belong\nto a class of highly inflexible DNAs; two strong nucleosome positioning\nsequences that share a set of particular sequence features common to\nnucleosome-preferring DNAs; and a CG-rich sequence representative of high\nG+C-content genomic regions that correlate with high nucleosome occupancy in\nvivo.

Thus, it is imperative to understand the\nenergetics associated with segregation to design materials with desirable\nproperties. Here, molecular statics simulations were employed to analyze the\nenergetics associated with the segregation of various elements (He, H, C, P,\nand V) to four <100> (Sigma 5 and 13 GBs) and six <110> (Sigma 3,9,and 11 GBs)\nsymmetric tilt grain boundaries in alpha-Fe.

The method works well with observations at high spectral and\nangular resolutions, and is suited to the analysis of 2D velocity fields in Ha\nfrom Fabry-Perot spectroscopy, (though it is also applicable to fields in 21cm\nemission from HI, or to CO emission lines). The observations are mainly from\nthe GHASP spectrometer data base, taken on the 1.93m telescope at Haute\nProvence, plus some data from the GHaFaS spectrometer on the 4.2m WHT at La\nPalma. We find clear indications of resonance effects in the disk velocity\nfields of virtually all of the 104 galaxies. The number of resonance radii\ndetected ranges from one to seven, with a median of four. We have derived the\nresonance curves: Omega, Omega+/-kappa/2, Omega+/-kappa/4 against radius for\nall the galaxies, and used them to derive the ILR, the OLR, and the two 4:1\nresonances for each corotation in each galaxy. This led us to discover a\npattern in over 70% of the sample: given two pattern speeds, say Omega1 and\nOmega2, the OLR of Omega1 coincides with the corotation of Omega2, and the\ninner 4:1 resonance of Omega2 coincides with the corotation of Omega1.

This pattern is found once in 42 of\nthe galaxies, twice in a further 26, three times in five, and even four times\nin one galaxy.

Smart\nhomes define optimal consumption as either balancing/leveling consumption such\nthat the utility company is presented with a uniform demand or as minimizing\nconsumption costs by storing energy during off-peak time periods when prices\nare lower and use the stored energy during peak time periods when prices are\nhigher. Due to the varying nature of energy requirements of household and\nmarket energy prices over different time periods in a day, households face a\ntrade-off between consuming to meet their current energy requirements and/or\nstoring energy for future consumption and/or spending energy stored in the\npast. These trade-offs or consumption preferences of the household are modeled\nas utility functions using consumer theory. We introduce two different utility\nfunctions, one for cost minimization and another for consumption\nbalancing/leveling, that are maximized subject to respective budget,\nconsumption, storage and savings constraints to solve for the optimum\nconsumption profile. The optimization problem of a household with energy\nstorage is formulated as a geometric program for consumption\nbalancing/leveling, while cost minimization is formulated as a linear\nprogramming problem. Simulation results show that the proposed model achieves\nextremely low peak to average ratio in the consumption balancing/leveling\nscheme with about 8% reduction in consumption costs and the least possible\namount for electricity bill with about 12% reduction in consumption costs in\nthe cost minimization scheme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Oct 2013 21:14:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

We report detailed analyses of the resonance lines, which\nfully resolve the cyclotron mass structure of the main Fermi surface sheets. A\nparticular focus is given to the anomalous splitting of the sharpest resonance\nline near the [110] direction under in-plane magnetic-field rotation, which\nimplies peculiar electronic structure in the hidden order phase. The results\nunder the field rotation from [110] toward [001] direction reveal that the\nsplitting is a robust feature against field tilting from the basal plane. This\nis in sharp contrast to the reported frequency branch alpha in the quantum\noscillation experiments showing a three-fold splitting that disappears by a\nsmall field tilt, which can be explained by the magnetic breakdown between the\nlarge hole sphere and small electron pockets. Our analysis of the cyclotron\nresonance profiles reveals that the heavier branch of the split line has a\nlarger scattering rate, providing evidence for the existence of hot-spot\nregions along the [110] direction. These results are consistent with the broken\nfourfold rotational symmetry in the hidden-order phase, which can modify the\ninterband scattering in an asymmetric manner. We also extend our measurements\ndown to 0.7 K, which results in the observation of cyclotron resonance in the\nsuperconducting state, where novel effects of vortex dynamics may enter.

We are interested in\nsituations where global mesh quality and tight coupling to the physical\nsolution is important. We consider elliptic PDE based mesh generation and\npresent a method for the construction of adaptive meshes in two spatial\ndimensions using domain decomposition that is suitable for an implementation on\nparallel computing architectures. The method uses the stochastic representation\nof the exact solution of a linear mesh generator of Winslow type to find the\npoints of the adaptive mesh along the subdomain interfaces. The meshes over the\nsingle subdomains can then be obtained completely independently of each other\nusing the probabilistically computed solutions along the interfaces as boundary\nconditions for the linear mesh generator. Further to the previously\nacknowledged performance characteristics, we demonstrate how the stochastic\ndomain decomposition approach is particularly suited to the problem of grid\ngeneration - generating quality meshes efficiently. In addition we show further\nimprovements are possible using interpolation of the subdomain interfaces and\nsmoothing of mesh candidates. An optimal placement strategy is introduced to\nautomatically choose the number and placement of points along the interface\nusing the mesh density function. Various examples of meshes constructed using\nthis stochastic-deterministic domain decomposition technique are shown and\ncompared to the respective single domain solutions using a representative mesh\nquality measure.

Besides, these jets have a peculiar\nstructure: the main fraction of the jet energy is carried by a single leading\nhadron, so such jets are very rare. The constraints imposed by energy\nconservation enforce an early color neutralization and a cease of gluon\nradiation. The produced colorless dipole does not dissipate energy anymore and\nis evolving to form the hadron wave function. The small and medium pT region is\ndominated by the hydrodynamic mechanisms of hadron production from the created\nhot medium. The abrupt transition between the hydrodynamic and perturbative QCD\nmechanisms causes distinct minima in the pT dependence of the suppression\nfactor R_{AA} and of the azimuthal asymmetry v2. Combination of these\nmechanisms allows to describe the data through the full range of pT at\ndifferent collision energies and centralities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Oct 2013 08:03:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 21 Oct 2013 15:48:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-22"}

Such systems do not\nsatisfy the additivity, which results in some unfamiliar properties related to\nphase transitions. In this paper, the concept of additivity and its consequence\nare explained and the recent progress on statistical mechanics of long-range\ninteracting systems are reviewed. It is shown that the parameter space is\nclearly decomposed into the three regions according to the stability of the\nuniform state predicted by the mean-field theory. Based on this parameter space\ndecomposition, recent results on the exactness of MF theory are explained. When\nthe interaction is non-negative (ferromagnetic), the analysis of the mean-field\ntheory is exact and a typical spin configuration is always uniform in the\ncanonical ensemble. However, in the restricted canonical ensemble, i.e., the\ncanonical ensemble with a restriction of the value of the magnetization, it is\nshown that the mean-field theory does not necessarily give the exact\ndescription of the system and phase transitions between the mean-field uniform\nstates (MF phase) and the inhomogeneous states (non-MF phase) occur. A new\nfinding is that when the interaction potential changes its sign depending on\nthe distance, the non-MF phase appears even in the canonical ensemble.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Oct 2013 08:25:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-15"}

Compositional program analyses are\ndesirable because they can yield scalable (and easily parallelizable) program\nanalyses.\n  This paper presents algebraic framework for designing, implementing, and\nproving the correctness of compositional program analyses.

This model first appeared in\nthe early literature on charge order in magnetite. In the limit where the\ninteractions become short-ranged, the model has a ground state with an\nextensive entropy and dipolar charge-charge correlations. When long range\ninteractions are introduced, the exact degeneracy is broken. We study the\nthermodynamics of the model and show the presence of a correlated charge liquid\nwithin a temperature window in which the physics is well described as a liquid\nof screened charged defects. The structure factor in this phase, which has\nsmeared pinch points at the reciprocal lattice points, may be used to detect\ncharge ice experimentally. In addition, the model exhibits fractionally charged\nexcitations $\\pm q/2$ which are shown to interact via a $1/r$ potential. At\nlower temperatures, the model exhibits a transition to a long-range ordered\nphase. We are able to treat the Coulombic charge ice model and the dipolar spin\nice model on an equal footing by mapping both to a constrained charge model on\nthe diamond lattice.
